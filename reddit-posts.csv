t3_dlf3t6,No girl ever seemed interested in me [19M],"Almost all my friends have/have had girlfriends or just opposite sex attention while I'm always completely invisible. Never been called attractive or anything close to it (even got called ugly once by a girl way back in High School) and it's making me feel completely unwanted and lonely. I tried to convince myself it's better being alone but it just isn't...
I've tried a couple times but they ALL rejected me. I also have EXTREME approach anxiety and lock up whenever I have to talk to a girl I find pretty, I talk way too much with my (VERY few) friends but just lose my way with words with women. I should mention that NOT EVER, NOT IN the time I can remember myself has ANY girl expressed any interest

Sometimes I just want to curl up in my bed and sleep for weeks straight. There's a girl I like in my university now but she never met me, never even seen me and I don't have the guts to approach her because I'm 100% sure she won't want anything to do with me. I don't even think about sex I just want the companionship and the affection, just the knowledge that I,xm important to someone",dating_advice

t3_dljyza,Just found out I'm dating a trans woman,"Straight cis male here, started dating an amazing woman.  She was cute,  smart, into a lot of the same things that I am, and the conversations felt so great and natural.  She recently told me she is a post surgery trans woman.

I feel uncomfortable and conflicted.  Hell, I feel uncomfortable that I feel uncomfortable.  I don't want to feel averse.  I've never considered this before, but I feel if the connection is good that I should be open minded.  I don't like that I feel uncomfortable about it and if I can feel like I did before she told me I'd want to be able to do that.  First date after she told me felt awkward to me at first, but I noticed from the start that she was still the same cute girl to me most of the time.

I also feel terrible that she has to go through this crap over and over.  She told me that men almost always leave when she tells them, and while I get the discomfort (since I feel it too) I think that's a terrible thing she has to deal with that is really unfair. anyone on here gone through this?  Any advice?  If I can get past this I think there is real potential here. Thank you :)",dating_advice
t3_dlp453,high school crush matched with me on a dating app almost ten years later,"ya'll. i am about to lose my mind right now, because what is going on is simply so absurd but so ravishing for me at the same time. when i was in high school, i was the quirky, awkward acne+braces kid trying to find her voice and self at the same time so my dating ops were slim to none till the very last year of my senior year. anyways, there was this guy...this guy who would say the most incredible, thoughtful, most profound things out of nowhere from the course of having classes with him on and off from 8th grade to senior year, and in short...i just knew that as we progressed in age and maturity between the walls of the high school experience.. he was not like the others. we had brief conversations through my time of middle school and high school where he would sometimes initiate them, but i was too shy and too self critical of myself to try to actually pursue anything or even think i could have anything romantically with him because he was also stunning on the eyes and i was...not...to put it simply. put together the image of the socially awkward, unattractive female scrambling through the halls trying to not be seen or make eye contact and you have me in a nutshell during those years...

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward and not a lot has changed in the feeling awkward all the time department, but i am decently attractive now and able to actually talk to dudes for 5 hours or 8 even sometimes on the first date and just in general. so, i'm perusing through the dating apps that i'm  on+sites because i'm single obvs and i actually pay for some  of them every now and then to just like short line the mindless swiping...and i see my old high school crush...liking me...ME...on one of the apps. i blink as slow as i possibly can to process this optical illusion, but his face is still there. his name. all the signs that this is the same man i fell for years ago from afar...and everything that could possibly allow me to crave a human as much as i did this man comes rushing in with the most intense waves of emotions i've felt in weeks....years even. i've been in love before and had bursts of good relationship moments that overwhelmed me, but to this day no one has caused as huge of an internal uproar as seeing this man or being around him.i don't want to screw this up by saying something abnormal or off the wall, so reddit...ya'll...if you have any suggestions on what to say first...please HALP a girl out. i know he knows it's me, but i'm just not sure how to broach this feeling of shock and anxiety to even begin to craft a proper response.",dating_advice

t3_dlo1br,I [18M] can't get over my crush on my best friend [19F] of several years and after things got a bit more serious I don't know how to handle it without potentially ruining our friendship,"*Obligatory throwaway because she knows my main account.*

Sorry for the long post but I'm sure I'm not the only one who is (or was) in this specific situation (you'll see in a moment) but I couldn't find any other post matching my case so here it goes:

So I [18M] met my best friend [19F] a couple of years ago. We started talking daily and soon realized we have the same topics of interest and we get along very good. About a year of texting daily and meeting several times a month I realized I had a crush on her. About this time we started talking about our dating life and what we look for in a boyfriend/girlfriend but her standards were unrealisticly high (imho) and although I felt like she was a perfect match for me, I realized I just don't stand a chance and decided to try and get over it in shstead of confessing and potentially ruining our friendship or eating myself from the inside.

Another year passes and our friendship is only getting stronger. We sleep-over at each other's place every so often and we talk about things I didn't think I'd share with anyone. We take each other to dinner every now and then just for fun and our friendship is better-then-ever every day. I also got over the crush I had on her and feel that I'm finally ready to date other women which I did in the last 6 month but nothing came out of it.
I also know she was dating other guys at that period of time (and before it tbh) and we both share with each other that we are actively looking for a romantic relationship.

This brings us to this month. This month she slept over at my place for at least once a week (once even for 3 days) since we hangout a lot and she lives in another city which is like a 2 hours train ride away. We recently talked about again about the things we look to have in a future bf/gf and suddenly (although to be fair, we hadn't talked about it for about a year) her standards were WAY LOWER. She said most of the things she said she were looking for the last time we talked doesn't really matter to her anymore and she is basically looking for a decent human being who wouldn't want to have sex with her after 2 dates. Very cool, can do, but this is not what made me crush on her again.

The weeks after, every time we met she got more and more touchy (like, physically). She touched me a lot when talking to me and I obviously returned her in the same manner. We watched a movie at my place and she lets me lay my head on her shoulder (keep in mind that usually we barely have physical contact except for hugging when meeting or saying goodbye) etc..

The thing that made me crush on her HARD again was when we met yesterday. She was touchy (again, physically) as the new usually which I'm totally cool with and is returning her with that same touchy-ness and she suggested we watch a movie together. Cool! She picks a comedy movie and we had a blast watching it on her bed and when not bursting in laugh, we laid each other's head on each other (if it makes sense) and she puts her hand on mine but in a kinda casual manner.. After the movie ends we stayed there laying down on her bad and continue to talk about some stuff. The whole time she keeps rubbing my shoulder/arm occasionally when she talked and I did the same in return.. We end up talking about some situation that was very difficult for her to go to through and while I was trying to make her feel better, we end up kinda cuddling/hugging. At the end I gave her a huge hug (best hug I've ever had) and we stayed like this for about 10 minutes.


At this point you may be thinking that I should totally go for it but consider the following:
1. The past weeks we were talking about very personal topics so her behavior might be explained by her being extra vulnerable and needing to feel safe.

2. Since we use to take each other to dinner, I cant really ask her for a date to see how she reacts. It'd just be another night of us hanging out...

3. I really *really* cannot afford to lose her. She is my best friend and I would be devastated if I was to lose her. I don't want to do anything that will ruin our friendship. On one hand, I'm afraid it's just some temporary need of attention and I don't want to scare her off. On the other hand, I don't want to miss that train either.


I've never had a gf before (and she never had a bf) and I'm very bad at picking up hints. My social anxiety doesn't help either... I just can't stop thinking about it.
Sorry for the long reading, will appreciate any advice - especially wether or not I should confess to her about my feelings and HOW should I do it (like, what is the best way not to scare her off etc)

t3_dlspab,How do I stop falling for distant people?,"I have noticed a pattern in my relationships where I‚Äôll fall really hard for people who ultimately end up becoming more and more distant.

Usually, they‚Äôll reciprocate interest for 3-4 months, and then slowly stop initiating and responding to my texts, sometimes ghosting me completely. Since my romantic feelings are all or nothing, this devastates me every time, and I end up being heartbroken for far longer than the relationship actually lasted. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy for a number of years, but can‚Äôt figure out the pattern. Since this has happened so many times, I can‚Äôt help but be anxious every time a new relationship begins because it feels so fragile.      It feels like most people are able to find long term partners fairly easily, and I can‚Äôt help but feel this is a reflection of my attachment style or the traits I‚Äôm attracted to in partners. 

Does anyone have advice or similar experiences to share?

Edit: I also wanted to add that I‚Äôm not a serial dater. It takes me a long time to find people I like, so I‚Äôve spent most of my life single. I probably develop crushes only once every couple years, and most of the time those don‚Äôt lead anywhere.",dating_advice
t3_dl24i2,The practical guide to bailing out on a first date,"I'm sure we've all had this happen to us at some point, and sometimes we have to do it too.

**Case1**, my friend Bob: How Not To Bail:

Bob met someone at a wedding, had a great chat, exchanged numbers, asked her out for a drink a few days later, she agreed, they settle on a time and place. He messages again the day before to confirm they are still on. She never replies.  Made him feel like shit.

**Case2**, a less bad but still bad case of How Not To Bail:

This happened to me last weekend. Matched on bumble, had a good chat, agree to meet up in the evening (at a location she suggested) in a couple of days. The day comes, I message in the morning to confirm we are still on. Nothing for the next 6h, although she's read it. 1h before I would be leaving the house, she calls me and says she's really sorry but she's actually got to go to a thing. I say no worries (although I am irritated by this), let me know if you want to re-arrange. She never messages me again, but I give her props for calling and at least sounding apologetic. She acknowledged it was a shitty thing to do. So some credit due, but it still sucked because with more notice I could have done something else with my time, and I'm pretty sure she knew from much earlier she'd have to bail.

Sometimes, you've got to bail. For whatever reason. Here is my guide on a) how to bail on someone in the least hurtful way possible and b) how to be bailed on.

**Arranging to meet:**

1. Only agree to meet in good faith. If you actually do not want to meet, DO NOT AGREE TO MEET. Be an adult and turn them down to begin with if you don‚Äôt want to meet. It's less hurtful than ghosting them.
2. Don‚Äôt make arrangements to meet if you aren‚Äôt certain you can make them. Just pick a different time.

**If you really have to genuinely bail:**

1. Actually communicate with your date. It takes 30s. Ghosting after agreeing to meet is shockingly disrespectful and always makes the recipient feel like shit as they slowly realise what you‚Äôre doing. Be an adult about it.
2. Calling rather than texting makes you seem more genuine and will help an apology go over better. But either will do.
3. If you don't want to come across as a douche it had better be a good reason. The shorter the notice the better the reason needs to be. If the reason is that you‚Äôve found a better prospect and would rather date them, make up a good reason to bail, bail well in advance, and then don‚Äôt re-arrange. I still think this is pretty shitty, to be avoided if possible, and it‚Äôs still not awesome for the recipient, but at least you didn‚Äôt ghost them. Tell them actually you've been really busy lately and need to take a step back whilst your life calms down.
4. Give as much notice as possible. Before the day is best, morning of the day is OK, last minute is never OK unless it‚Äôs an emergency. I would define last minute as too late for them to have a realistic chance of arranging to do something else with their time.
5. Be very apologetic. You just wasted this person‚Äôs time and depending on how much notice you gave them you stopped them from doing anything else either.
6. If you actually do want to meet, re-arrange a time then and there, don‚Äôt wait.
7. Accept that you probably won‚Äôt meet, because you‚Äôve flaked, you‚Äôve annoyed them, and they are probably now looking for other more reliable prospects.

**If you are being bailed on but still want to meet in future:**

1. Accept you are probably never going to meet. In my experience if someone bails on the first date you‚Äôve arranged, there‚Äôs about a 90% chance you‚Äôll never meet. I suspect most of the time the ‚Äúreason‚Äù is just an excuse because they don‚Äôt want to meet you any more and don‚Äôt want to tell you the real reason why. I suspect the real reasons are usually ‚ÄúI never actually wanted to meet in the first place‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found a better person to date‚Äù. Both are shitty to hear so I don't fault the use of a lie.
2. Be cool. It‚Äôs OK to be annoyed but if you want to give this person another chance you cannot show much irritation because who wants to meet someone that‚Äôs really annoyed with them? Sometimes these things are unavoidable.
3. Don‚Äôt bend over backwards to accommodate them. If they really want to meet they‚Äôll arrange to make it happen, it‚Äôs on them to fix.
4. They won‚Äôt arrange to make it happen. In my experience 90% of people that bailed on the first date never bothered to re-arrange. I guess they found better prospects.
5. Start looking for new prospects.

Basically, the take home from this is: be an adult and treat people with respect. Try to put a value on the time they allocated you and be mindful what you are doing by bailing. And if one of you bails on the first date it'll probably never happen.",dating_advice
t3_dljgsf,For the first time ever I managed to get a couple of numbers!,"I did it!

Having been previously a bit unkeen on re-joining tinder (as when i initially used it two years ago I barely got any matches and confidence-wise I was a wreck) I decided to reinstall it yesterday just for curiosity's sake. 

In the space between my first time using it and now, I went through growth, personality and physically and I feel like this helped me for good in life; [I took the gym seriously](https://imgur.com/a/fTIPmfp), groomed myself weekly and even grew a beard! Even joined a retail chain and worked with all kinds of customers, over there you really learn to have patience and empathy takes you a long way. When you make those kind of changes, its kind of hard not to take a liking to yourself, especially once progress starts coming in!

With that said, I was surprised at the amount of matches that I was getting today! I don't feel like tooting my own horn or anything but I feel as if  I have those last two years to thank, so much so that I though 'fuck it!' and asked for their numbers so I can better get to know them.

t3_dlo8vj,Is it possible to be interested in someone but rarely text them?,"I'm gonna try to keep this short but basically, I \[20F\] have been talking to this guy \[21M\] for about 3 months now (2 of those months we weren't in the same city because of summer break, but for this past month we've have been going on dates about 2-3x a week). We've been having sex almost every time we've seen each other, and he makes it a point to take me on actual dates, even though I'd be fine just going over and watching a movie and cuddling, which makes it seem like he wants something more than just a casual fwb.

&amp;#x200B;

He always pays for everything, is always the one to set up dates, has introduced me to his friends, and has told me that he wants a relationship out of this. Literally the only problem with him is that he never texts me. Most days we probably text for like 20 minutes, but I initiate it 8/10 times. I have never brought this up to him as being an issue because I feel like it's just his personality. Also, whenever I do text him, he usually responds within a few minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't really ever interact with people over the phone during the day (he isnt really active on social media or anything either) and he grew up in a different country than me so it could be a cultural difference? I've also never seen him on his phone when he's with me so maybe he just isn't a big phone guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know if anybody else is like this. You really like a person and could see yourself dating them, but don't feel the need to text them. I'm also probably being overanxious and dramatic, but I really like this guy and don't want to talk myself out of anything just because he doesn't text me nonstop, like most guys do when they're interested in me.

I think she is quite attractive but I have a hard time trying to approach her, I don't even know her name! I'm a fairly sociable dude I have good banter with most people, even some people on her team. I talk to this guy that sits near her but I get this really odd vibe from her. Like even if we are crossing paths I feel like she makes an effort to not look at me. Sometimes when I'm talking to her coworker at his desk, other people around her will sometimes join in or talk but she would always maintain looking away. When we cross paths or ever are in each other's way she will look away always, and kinda hurry away. If we ever do make eye contact she will look away almost immediately. So I'm finding it difficult to even say Hi in a casual situation. I just assumed that maybe she caught me glancing at her once or twice and determined I am a creep so I think i should just forget about the whole thing?

t3_dlo8dk,Is refusing to give blow jobs a deal breaker?,"Im 25 and only been in 3 sexual relationships. I've also got a jaw problem that when opening it too much is clicks and cracks, and it hurts like hell. 
Previous partners have told me bjs are a must, and its not fair not to give them.. even though giving them hurts and its a turn off for me because of the pain (to which my respond was still not to do it often and they ended up cheating on me).

t3_dlp9k1,"If she isn't into me and I make a move, I think it will mess things up","19M here. There is a girl (20F) that used to go to my school (we didn't know each other then, I know her brother so that was the connection) that I contacted a few months ago for advice about getting into college and preparing for the application exam (as she was already a freshman and could provide some tips). She provided me with a ton of advice and materials all throughout my preparation, like, I was really surprised with how much she helped me, basically a complete stranger to her. She even gave me the scripts she spent months on making, asking nothing in return. 
The exam went great, I made it into college, we see each other every day now, she still helps me a great deal whenever I ask etc.
My buds started teasing me, said she was into me. I was like ""nah, why would she be, she is older, I am just a kid she helped etc.""
But then it got me thinking. She goes out of her way to greet me everytime she sees me, talks to me a lot, laughs at the dumbass things I say, kinda fidgety around me now that I think about it too, I heard her tell her friends how smart I am. Is she trying to hint at something here? (I asked to take her out as gratitude for help once and she was too modest to accept.)

t3_dlqfxw,Am I in the wrong here?,"Hello! I really need advice about this situation.

I 20F starter dating 26M 2-3 months back, pretty much everything had been going great and smoothly. He asked me to be exclusive about two weeks ago and I ofcourse said yes as I had been planning to bring it up as well. I‚Äôve met his friends, family and everything. We had planned holidays and such so it was pretty serious. 

Anyway, last weekend (Friday) I was hanging out my friend. My friend had her tinder open and she saw that my guy had updated his tinder bio. I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know how to react. She texted him asking him about it since they‚Äôre friends as well and he said that it was ‚Äújust fun‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt respond and he called her repeatedly but I asked her not to pick up because I didn‚Äôt know what to say. 
The next day(Saturday), only once he found out she‚Äôd told me about his tinder, he texted me saying he ‚Äúonly updated the profile because it was fun but didn‚Äôt want to date anyone other than me, you never find anyone on tinder anyway‚Äù and he asked if we were okay. I told him we weren‚Äôt okay and that my grandma was visiting me so I couldn‚Äôt talk at the moment. (Which was true) 
He didn‚Äôt respond to that and completely went off the grid. 
Then, on Sunday I tried to call him and he didn‚Äôt pick up, so I texted him saying I was ready to talk about it asking him to call me. 
On Monday he texted me back saying that he‚Äôd already explained himself, didn‚Äôt know what else to say and that he thought I knew him better than to jump to conclusions about why he‚Äôd updated his tinder. This pissed me off so I tried to call him again, he didn‚Äôt pick up, so I texted asking if he didn‚Äôt have the guts to talk to me. 
This did the trick, he went on a rant saying he just didn‚Äôt want to talk to me, that he‚Äôd wanted to talk to me on Saturday but that I didn‚Äôt respond (??) That he didn‚Äôt get mad when I get messages from other guys and brought up this time when another dude drove me home after a night out (nothing happened there) because he trusted me but I couldn‚Äôt trust him now that he updated his tinder. I tried to tell him my side of everything while listening to his side. We proceeded to text about it for a bit but then he said he was going to face dinner with his family. 
Apparently he‚Äôs been having dinner with his family for over 24 hours because I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. 

I sent him a text saying I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions but it‚Äôs hard not to take his silence as him not wanting to give us a try and that he didn‚Äôt think I was worth it. He hasn‚Äôt responded and it‚Äôs been 4 hours.

t3_dlt2k1,I [24/M] think I am still in love with a girl [22/F] I dated for 2 months who moved back to Germany. Need advice.,"Apologies for the length of this post, I just really need to get this off my chest. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to hear me out.

I have always struggled with social anxiety, and have never had a meaningful long term relationship in my life. So, earlier this year, I did what most single guys who don't go out much do and made a Tinder account. I met a girl on there and we really hit it off over texts, so we set up a date at a local bar.

She was absolutely stunning. Smart, beautiful, funny, interesting, and everything else you could ever dream for in a girl. We talked and drank until midnight and we were too tired to continue. We didn't wait long to see each other again, and again we talked and drank all night. We kissed, and from that point she had stolen my heart. I think it was the first time I have ever truly been in love.

However, there is a catch: She is German. She was only here to complete an internship that was necessary for her to apply to PhD programs here in the States (she already has a master's degree at the age of 22. That's how smart and amazing she is). 

She left for Germany 2 months later with the status of if she would ever come back to my area of the States up in the air. We agreed to stay in touch, but we didn't really address the status of our relationship (we never really explicitly said that we were dating, I think because we both knew it would have to end soon). 

Messages got more and more far apart and now it's been 3 months since we've spoken. I don't know about her, but the reason I stopped messaging her regularly is for two reasons:

1. I wanted to move on. The distance just seems too far for us to work out. Even if she returns to the states to complete her PhD, it's unlikely to be anywhere near me.

2. I don't know if I was as special to her as she was to me. Frankly, I highly doubt it. While I have never been in a long term relationship, she had been in one that lasted 8 years (Yes, 8. That's not a typo). The guy had purposed to her and she rejected it because she felt she was too young and had no idea where her life would take her, which led to them breaking up. A 2 month fling with some American boy must be totally forgettable by her standards, right?

Every date I've been on since then just hasn't been the same. Nobody is as smart, as beautiful, or as funny as her. I can't get her out of my head. It's like I am not even looking for another girl, I'm just looking for the next ""her"". 

However, because I have never been in love before, I am really concerned that I'm just working myself up and making what we had out to be more than it was since I have nothing to compare it to. Maybe what we had was mediocre at best, but I just have nothing to compare it to?

I don't know what to do. It's unlikely she feels the same way about me and even if she did we are practically on opposite sides of the planet; should I just forget about her? We haven't spoken in 3 months; would it be too weird to suddenly tell her how I feel? I didn't even do that properly while she was here.

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I just feel lost.",dating_advice

to be honest, i knew she had a bf because instagram is a thing, but still. she laughs at all my shitty jokes and smiles and like sits with me so i kinda thought i had a chance, but her bringing him up made me feel like oof

obviously the only one who wish truly know how she feels is her, but is she interested? or is she just being a friend. i don‚Äôt really know man she‚Äôs so cool and i caught feels. should i just continue to talk to her as a friend or pursue something more, cause i want this haha.",dating_advice

we both follow each other on instagram and like pictures of each other and i feel like i should make a move by hitting her up or something before i enlist to the army in 2 months and probably lose the chance for ever.

what i wanted to ask is how hard is it to maintain a relationship and knowing you are far from you partner

t3_dlt1uq,Really don‚Äôt know how to proceed with this.,"A few weeks ago, I made it a goal of mine to finally start talking to this girl in my class that I was attracted to since the first day of class. I never talked to her until a few weeks ago because I thought I would have no chance until I decided to take a leap of faith. 

I first introduced myself at a campus store and we talked for a bit. Last week I felt like I made progress because after class I walked with her and we had a good 10 minute conversation about simple things like what we like and how our class is. I told her that she was very nice to talk to since I haven‚Äôt made any new friends and she told me that I am very nice as well. 

I talked to her a little bit in class today of how her weekend is and she asked how mine is. Only thing was that she was on her laptop and I sat next to her but she wasn‚Äôt talking to me until I initiated a conversation so I kind of feel like she may not be interested in me in that specific way. 

It‚Äôs just that I want to get to know her better since i don‚Äôt really get the chance to talk to her in class.

These are usually group activities. I have asked her several times if she has wanted to hangout one on one an she never seems interested or never has time. I wish she would be honest with me and just tell me she just wants to be friends because I would be okay with that since I really don't have much friends.

t3_dlsnw9,Am I interpreting this correctly?,"(I‚Äôm female and we‚Äôre both in our early 20s) 

So after swearing I would never use tinder again (lol) I drunkenly redownloaded it recently and I started talking to someone. We‚Äôve been in contact for about two weeks and last week we decided to move off the app.

We talked for a few days and it was pretty awesome, we got along really well and had a lot in common. He seemed like he really liked me so far and the other night (Friday) when we were texting he suggested going out the following weekend. I agreed. The following night we FaceTimed for way longer than we intended to and again it went awesome. He again seemed like he really liked me so far and we again talked about what we‚Äôd do the following weekend and decided we could tease out the details later on in the week. But before we hung up we agreed that we were both really busy and wanted to focus on the stuff we had to do this week so we could have a great time together in person. He said maybe we could talk briefly during the week. We didn‚Äôt want to hang up lol but agreed we‚Äôd talk soon.

I texted him the following night and he answered relatively quickly and made a joke we made up the night before. We had a brief exchange but it tapered off bc I was really busy and couldn‚Äôt stick around. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. The next day (yesterday) I didn‚Äôt hear from him, which didn‚Äôt bother me bc I figured he was busy and didn‚Äôt want to set up a routine of texting every single day anyway.

Today‚Äôs the real doozy. I didn‚Äôt plan to text him but I realized I had something going on the day we had planned to go out so I asked if we could switch to the following day instead. He didn‚Äôt read the message for over an hour, which I found odd because he usually answered pretty quickly. He finally responded and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúhey sorry I‚Äôm really busy this weekend and I have a lot of stuff going on. I should be good after but I‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù I responded with only a ‚Äúokay no prob‚Äù but again it‚Äôs been like 4 hours and he hasn‚Äôt even opened it. 

I find this so confusing tbh. I‚Äôm kinda thinking he‚Äôs changed his mind somehow and is kinda avoiding me now? I just feel like if he really wanted to see me he‚Äôd find a way to make time. Also, the fact that he didn‚Äôt think he could hang out and didn‚Äôt bother to bring it up until I said something makes me again think he‚Äôs avoiding me. Finally the tone of the message seems like it‚Äôs super distant though usually he seemed a lot warmer in his texts. I‚Äôm kinda stunned by how he seems to have done a 180 in such a short period of time especially since it seemed like there was absolutely nothing wrong the other day. I‚Äôve racked my brains and don‚Äôt think I said or did anything wrong...usually I end up doing something cringy but this time around I really don‚Äôt think I did. 

Do the vibes I‚Äôm picking up seem accurate? Does it seem like he‚Äôs even bs‚Äôing me about letting me know later? I have a feeling I‚Äôm not gonna hear back from him.

I‚Äôm thinking I should wait until the weekend‚Äôs over and message him and be like ‚Äúare you still up for this or no?‚Äù Would that be helpful to the situation or should I just leave it?

t3_dlsn80,Would I sound insecure..?,"
(F24) I‚Äôm seeing a guy (m29) we hooked up three times, he takes me out, brings me things (he brought me my favorite tea when I wasn‚Äôt feeling good), is always complimenting me, paying for me, etc. we have so much in common, but he is a terrible texter. Maybe like 2-3 times a day, but I see that he‚Äôs on Facebook sometimes without responding to my texts, and I get a little irritated. When he does respond, his messages are a little dry and boring. Every day he asks me ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhow are things?‚Äù And I always have cute or funny things to tell him (which he always smiles and acts interested in person), but in text he seems bored. I‚Äôll usually respond to him immediately or after 20 mins, and he doesn‚Äôt reply for hours! He has a high demand job, and is pretty busy often, so we see each other like once a week. After writing all this, I feel like I‚Äôm kinda over analyzing a bit. It‚Äôs just getting to the point where I don‚Äôt want to dwell on this guy if he‚Äôs just messing around with me, and I read other posts where guys said if they were interested in a girl, they would definitely text them back and be excited to. Should I just stop worrying about it? Would I look really insecure if I said something like ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt much of a texter?

Me and this girl got speaking a few days back on a site. We got on well, joked around a lot and stuff. Today she asked me about cooking food and if I could cook any Japanese food. After I said no she said she could teach me and that should be our first date.

I said I was up for it, and we continued talking for a bit longer. I then said I had to get ready to go out. I noticed her profile had her Instagram in it so I told her I sent a request on it (her account is private). She accepted it pretty much instantly, but I checked Instagram just now and she hasn't requested to follow me back yet.

I know it's 'only Instagram' and all, but if she's interested, wouldn't she follow me back? I already feel like this girl is way out of my league, and something like this just made me feel like she's trying to gain a few followers. Her ratio is only over 100 followers and over 300 followed though, so it feels weird.

Any idea what's up or if to take it as a bad thing? I know it's a tedious thing, but it's so basic to follow somebody you like and get a follow back, and since I haven't that's exactly what's making me think she's not truly interested, I don't know.",dating_advice

I‚Äôm going to the gym, enjoying my hobbies, etc. I‚Äôm happy with myself. 

Now a over month later Alex and I have been hanging out and talking more as friends. Like, she actually reaches out to me to talk and asks to hang out and as a result I‚Äôve been starting to develop a ‚Äúcrush‚Äù for Alex. People almost never reach out to me, much less ask me if I want to hang out so I feel like this ‚Äúcrush‚Äù might also just be me jumping the gun and getting way too excited as a result for a desperate want for affection and companionship.

When I first started dating her it became rough very quickly, she would blow up and completely shut down on me (jealousy issues, accuse me of cheating etc. ridiculous shit) Shes done alot thats hurt me mentally and caused insecurities I never had before in the beginning (googling how she wants to cheat, how she thinks im gay, trying to control me). Never could find out if she cheated. Puts on acts with different groups (friends, parents) making me think maybe shes just acting and this isnt her real self. But as our relationship prolonged she got help with her anxiety and borderline personality disorder and things got better. Things were good for about the past 1.5 years. As for the present now, she never leaves the house and doesn't hang out with friends (still uses her friends and only hangs out is she needs something), I try to encourage these traits.  Originally I was always pushing for her to come out and do stuff with me (said I sound like a gf) she hasn't been outside in three weeks. Now I prefer she didn't come out and do stuff with me. Like a escape, I feel extremely annoyed and angry 50% of the time. I feel unhappy and see other girls I find attractive and think ""I wonder if I'd be happier of I was dating someone else"". Though that could just be a grass is greener complex. I guess I feel stuck, I care for her and Im so damn proud of how far shes come (mental stability) but I am just unsure if I want to be with her forever. If things can get better.

t3_dlp27l,I (23M) don't know what I feel about a girl I met (20F),"3 days ago I met a girl on an app , typical stuff we just met on the same day we started talking . 
It went well and we kissed and hugged a lot , she was amazed by how fast she felt calm and comfortable with me , we met the very next day and spend it together at my flat , we cooked food , we started making out to some romantic music and it became essentially forplay , she tried initiating sex and I stopped her , I said I think it's to fast I want her to really feel comfortable sleeping with me I said we'll sleep some other day , it followed with me giving her a full body massage naked (I know her for less then 24 hours), after that I offered to take a shower together , and we went on and showered together with candle light , music , and passionate kissing.

She left , she texted ""thanks for today , can't remember the last time I was so calm and happy"" 
She felt like it was a dream
She stated to me she isn't looking for something serious after her past relationships ended badly.

We met the very next day (third in a row) and eventually I allowed myself to sleep with her because I felt she felt comfortable with me and it wasn't just ""the heat of the moment"".

It was really good and passionate and we learned more about each other. 
We lied in bed and started taking , she asked me with how many woman I've been and I said something like 8 in the last year , she instantly started crying asking ""so it doesn't mean anything to you?"" , I started crying üòÖ telling it does that's why I stopped her yesterday and if I only wanted that I could of managed to get it yesterday , I was bombarded with all kind of questions like ""what do you feel""? , ""What did you feel when you first saw me / kissed me "" , ""why I never been in a relationship"" , ""why do I like her"" , ""what do I want , what am I searching for"" etc. 
It was hard for me to answer all this but she looked satisfied with the answers (just said the truth honestly), and opened up to her.
I escorted her home and we had more wierd ""we really like each other vibes"". 
Now I can only see her a week from now 
I am really confused with what's going on , I have many FWB and I feel I have to put them on hold , but then she says she isn't looking for anything but she almost clearly cares about it. 

I am miserable because I carve the human contact and it was cut and now I have to wait , not touching anything else.

t3_dls4i7,"Feeling bad about myself, just need help dealing with a situation","So I (17 m) asked a girl (16 f) to the homecoming dance and she had said yes, however we weren't sure if it was going to be a friend thing or a date thing.  At the dance, we were getting along pretty well, and I asked if she would prefer it to be a friend thing or a date thing (we had been hanging out beforehand and a few days before the dance.  She said, ""I like you,"" to which I assumed she meant as a date (my mistake).  

After the dance, I asked her if she'd be down for a second date going to a park and playing disc golf, and she responded, ""I'd never done that, but ok!""  I assumed that this for sure meant we were dating (my mistake again).

Later on she asks me if I think we're dating, which I did, and she discloses that she doesn't want to date anyone for understandable, personal reasons that won't be disclosed here.

 I don't blame her for any of this, but I feel like an asshole for assuming.  But also, during the 3 day period in which I had thought we were dating, I was the happiest I'd ever been.  We really clicked personality-wise, and hanging out with her calmed my anxiety about pretty much everything.  After she clarified that we weren't dating, I feel horrible and depressed.  We're still good friends, and she said that I didn't do anything wrong, but I don't even know what to do.  Normally I take rejection pretty well, but I just feel empty now.  

I'm sure this sounds overly dramatic, but this is my 12th rejection (in a row), and none of them have felt this bad before.  I think it is mainly because if it weren't for her unchangeable reason that she can't date anyone, I think we would have been an amazing match for each other.  

Girl who will remain unidentified, if you read this, I don't hold you responsible at all for this situation, it's entirely on me.

Does anyone have any advice on how to move on or stop feeling like an idiot?  At this point, I'm honestly not sure I want to keep asking people out, I think I've reaching my breaking point.  After she clarified, I had an anxiety attack and my friends tried to help me out but to no avail.  It was worse than the time that strangers got into my car and forced me to drive them an hour across town.

I really honestly need some help dealing with this, or words of encouragement, or something? To put it simply, I need help.",dating_advice

So I‚Äôve been talking to this girl in my math class in college for a little bit. Last week, I invited her to go to Knotts scary farm and she said yes. However, she had to cancel because of complications with money. Today, I was going to ask her if she was okay with me spotting her ( I would have paid but she takes pride in paying things herself). However, for some reason, I just did not want to talk to her at all today.

t3_dls3gx,"Been dating for a month, things are really slow emotionally","How do I get this girl to really fall for me

We're already dating, we'll have been dating for a month on the 28th. We started talking sometime early September over Tinder. We're at the phase where we're getting to know each other, and while we acknowledge that we're in a relationship it still very much feels like a friendship. Neither of us are the head-over-heels-since-the-first-time-we've-met type so I'm not surprised that we both aren't super attached to each other, but this makes me feel uneasy because she might get bored. I'm really worried that we both see this as just a friendship that we slapped the ""dating"" label on. I feel a lot of potential in this but I think we need a shove towards the right direction.  I've also been friends with people that eventually did turn into really big crushes so I'm not ruling out that we just haven't known each other long enough.

He is in a superior position to me, but we‚Äôre the same age and I really like him/am attracted to him. I think he‚Äôs attracted to me, but I know he won‚Äôt overstep that boundary. I just want to know if this is a crush I should hold onto and reach out to him when I quit or/hope he will when we don‚Äôt work together (I do plan on leaving by early next year). 

These are just some signs, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just having wishful thinking: 

-He stares at me across the floor and if I‚Äôm speaking to someone else or laughing, I can feel him looking at me or kind of makes his way over to the conversation if he‚Äôs free. 

-He does treat me differently than my other co workers. If I need help, he‚Äôs on it right away. As with others he‚Äôd brush them aside. 

-He‚Äôs asked me how long my ex and I were together (when we were still dating). When my ex would come into our work and I‚Äôd clearly be upset over something, he would ask if I‚Äôm okay or in a silly voice say ‚Äúboys‚Äù and roll his eyes... when he said that once I didn‚Äôt even know he was paying attention to me or saw my ex there with me. 

-When we do get into a conversation, we are pretty similar and if it were outside of work I would be interested in him (I‚Äôm assuming maybe the same for him?) 

-The biggest thing is just feeling him stare at me across the floor. I don‚Äôt feel that from others, and he‚Äôll keep making eye contact if I look in the same way. 

-sometimes if he walks past me, I‚Äôll just grin/smile and he‚Äôll do the same and kind of laugh. 


Like I said, I‚Äôd rather keep it professional and not date a co worker... it‚Äôs just sometimes exciting to think he might feel the same way.

t3_dlffpd,"How to thrive in the dating world when you've never established yourself as a sexual being, or never had someone show interest?","Hey, I am a 21yo male who has never had sex, kissed a girl, held hands etc. In my youth I have missed out on about any (sexual) experience with the other sex that you can come up with. I did have a crush for a very long time but she didn't even know I existed. On average, I was about 2 years younger than my class mates ever since elementary, which was pretty difficult for me.

I find it weird to think about dating or read about romantic/sexual stories. It's foreign to me, like it's from another world. I have never had a girl show clear interest in me, for one thing. It's like I have never established myself as a sexual being. When I was younger, I was afraid to come across as creepy or needy because of my age and I didn't recognise the fact that I as a human being have needs like intimacy and love until pretty recently. I feel like growing up this way damages you mentally to the point where I am actively hurting my chances of finding what I want because it scares me. Lying next to a girl? That is alien to me, like it has never existed. Sex? Not gonna happen! Because I never really tried when I was younger (and when I did, I was hurt/rejected massively), it feels like it is futile anyways because nobody has ever wanted me after all. This entire new layer of life, romance, has never existed, like it's another dimension I cannot enter.

t3_dlonmm,Hookup (M23) who ghosted me (F21) has resurfaced again and it's left me confused.,"So I posted on a separate thread about a month ago and it was basically this :

\[So long story short, met him on Tinder (he's 23M and I'm 21F) and we hit it off from the first conversation we had on there. We sleep together quite regularly but on top of that he's been doing these things

\- Facetimes me 3-4 times a week for an hour before he goes to bed and we talk about basically anything. Same with texting except we text everyday and he starts the convo/always replies quickly even at work.

\- When I had to go to hospital for an emergency he seemed genuinely concerned, when I was alone in my flat over the summer he asked if I was okay and on a night out when he made a comment that upset me, the next morning the first thing he did was apologise.

\- When he's stayed over night he's confided in me about things he's insecure about, how much he misses his mum and how him being closed off has stopped him from settling down (then been very boyfriendy physically i.e. cuddling, forehead kisses etc.)

\- He's made jokes about us two being boyfriend and girlfriend

\- On his birthday he messaged if he could come see me because drama in his family had popped up.

Whenever I hinted about what we were he always dismissed it as ""purely sexual"" when it wasn't by any means\]

Anyway about a month or so ago  he came over, we slept together and we were cuddling and he was walking around my room and looking at my books whilst we were chatting. And he said, ""You said you were shy around guys but you're not shy around me."" I replied saying I'd known him for a while so I obviously wasn't going to be shy. He said, ""Do you really know me though?"". He put his clothes back on whilst repeating that I'd pissed him off and he stormed out. I was super confused and I tried reaching out to him for about a week but I got nothing from him so I stopped. 

Anyway I noticed he's been checking my social media (whilst I haven't been checking his). I didn't make anything of it until two or three days ago I saw whilst accidentally clicking on his update he was running past where I do rowing. When I checked with a friend who was at the rowing club at the time (was just asking her if she had a good day), she described a guy exactly like him looks wise ran past the entrance a few times and glanced at the entrance a few times before leaving. He lives about a half an hour walk from where I do rowing and he told me he always did running around the city centre where he lives just because it was easier.

t3_dlrdyj,"We never defined the relationship. I still have feelings for him, but I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs moved on.","I (28/M) have been hanging out with this guy, let‚Äôs call him Randy (40/M), for about one year. We met on an app and chatted for about 6 weeks before I finally met him in person. Due to the distance between us (about an hour drive), we only saw each other a few times during the first two months. However, I could tell there was a connection between us. We continued hanging out when we could, and we eventually started seeing each other more often. During the spring and early summer, things were going really well, and I kind of assumed we were ‚Äúseeing each other‚Äù, even though we never had that conversation. I really wanted to ‚Äúdefine the relationship‚Äù and have that talk, but I was afraid I would scare him off. I was happy with the way things were, I knew that labeling our relationship wouldn‚Äôt really change much (in terms of how often we see each other and talk), and I was pretty confident he wasn‚Äôt trying to see other people (neither was I). Also, I was naively assuming he would initiate the talk because he‚Äôs older and more experienced. For all of these reasons, I put off having ‚Äúthe talk.‚Äù

A few months ago, I noticed little things begin to change. He became a little less affectionate, we wouldn‚Äôt hang out as much, and when we would go out for dinner or drinks, the conversation did not flow as easily as before. One night, after dropping me off at home, he texted me and asked if we had a status. I instantly became tense and anxious because I was expecting the worst, and because this seemingly came out of nowhere. I told him we haven‚Äôt talked about it, but I would love to have that conversation. He texted me back and said he thought we were in the friends category. I immediately asked if we could talk instead of text, so I called him. We ended up having an emotional conversation about a lot of stuff going on in his life at the moment ‚Äì friends, family, his job ‚Äì and we didn‚Äôt really talk about our status. During the next few weeks after that conversation, things were relatively normal. We still texted and hung out the same amount as before, and the topic didn‚Äôt come up. I wanted to bring it up and continue the conversation, but there wasn‚Äôt a good time (in my opinion). So I put it off.

To back track a little, a few months after we started hanging out, Randy went to Europe for vacation. He ended up meeting a guy there on one of the first days (let‚Äôs call him Anthony), and apparently they instantly hit it off. Anthony hung out with Randy and his friends on a few of his excursions, and when it was time to leave, they decided to keep in touch. During the time when things were going really well with me and Randy, I would occasionally see texts pop up from Anthony, but I figured he was an old friend or something. I never knew how they met.

Fast forward to my emotional conversation with Randy‚Ä¶ one of the things he mentioned was that his friend Anthony was coming to visit soon, and that he really liked him. When I heard that, I had a mini panic attack. Why did he just tell me he liked someone? I thought he liked me? We didn‚Äôt spend much time on that topic, but I remembered he said it, and that stuck with me for the next few weeks.

Fast forward to last month ‚Äì Anthony comes to visit. Leading up to his visit, as I mentioned before, things were relatively normal between me and Randy. I wanted to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù, but I didn‚Äôt see a good opportunity to have it. When Anthony arrived, I gave Randy his space to enjoy the visit. I didn‚Äôt text him at all during the week-long visit, and he never texted me. However, Randy posted most of the visit on social media, so I got to see exactly what they were doing.

Every new post and picture that I saw of the two of them broke my heart a little bit more. During the year-or-so that Randy and I were ‚Äútogether‚Äù, he never posted about us on social media, and he didn‚Äôt have many pictures of us together saved on his phone. Now Anthony comes to visit and he posts selfies and pictures of every place they go. I was extremely jealous and pretty miserable the whole week.

When Anthony finally left, Randy texted me and we began to communicate as normal. I knew that I needed to talk to him about how I felt, so I went over to his house one night to watch a movie. Before the movie, we decided to order food, so he opened an app on his phone, put in his order, and then handed me the phone to place my order. He left the room to use the bathroom, and I had a very strong urge to snoop through his pictures to see what I could find, so I did. The reason I did so was because I guess I wanted to confirm what I already thought, but didn‚Äôt want to admit ‚Äì that Randy sees us as friends and nothing more. Well, I guess I got what I asked for. There were pictures/videos of them doing things they didn‚Äôt post about, selfies of them kissing, and even some x-rated videos. My heart literally sank into my stomach and I started to have a panic attack. Randy came back and saw that I wasn‚Äôt myself, and that‚Äôs when I finally told him we need to talk.

I asked him what he thought about us and the past year. He said that there were times when he wanted to take our relationship to the next level, and he was looking for signs from me that indicated I wanted to do the same. I absolutely wanted to take things to the next level, but as I said above, I was afraid I would scare him off and I didn‚Äôt want to mess up what we had going. Therefore, he interpreted my actions as not wanting to take the next step and just stay where we were. So I guess he assumed I wanted to stay more as friends, which is not at all what I wanted. However, since neither of us said anything to one another over the next few months, we both kept assuming what the relationship was. I assumed we were ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù but not exactly boyfriends, and he assumed we were nothing more than friends or FWB. Now there is someone else in the picture that Randy clearly has feelings for. I tried to ask Randy about him and Anthony and what he considered them to be, and he said that he is unsure. He‚Äôs unsure whether to pursue a relationship, or just let it go because of the distance.

I left the conversation in an OK headspace, but when I got home, I completely broke down. I‚Äôve been an anxious, miserable wreck for the past week thinking about how I missed my chance with Randy. How we both had feelings for each other and all it took was for one of us to say something. Or would that have even mattered because he had been texting Anthony the whole time we were ‚Äútogether‚Äù? I feel extremely guilty for snooping through Randy‚Äôs phone, and I can‚Äôt get the pictures/videos out of my head. Does Randy still have feelings for me? He did at one point, and we‚Äôve remained friends this whole time. Is he going to move to Europe to try and make it work with Anthony? Or are they not going to try and make it work?

I asked Randy if we can continue our conversation this weekend and he agreed. **I guess I‚Äôm looking for advice about the situation in general and potential questions I can ask Randy**. So far this is what I have:

¬∑ I still really like you and have feelings for you. Do you still have feelings for me? Or is the door shut on us and you‚Äôre trying to make the relationship with Anthony work?

¬∑ I feel very guilty about snooping through his phone and I‚Äôm wondering if I should confess?

¬∑ Should I ask about Anthony? Or will the details of their relationship just make me feel worse?

Recently I've had a few people literally block me on every social media mid-conversation which sends my mind into overdrive as from my end I can't understand what's gone wrong.

I guess I just wanted to put this out there and see if anyone else had experienced this or has any suggestions where I might be going wrong?",dating_advice
t3_dlneam,Canceled a plan I wanted to do with a girl I met on mdma and can‚Äôt really reschedule it soon without it being weird.,"Last week I met an interesting girl at a party. We have a friend in common. 

We cuddled and kissed after the party but didn‚Äôt have sex. The moment was more cute and warm then sexual and we were both tired. She gave me her telephone number.

I live 2 hours away from her and from said party but I will probably have an internship in her city this winter. 

I was supposed to have an interview in her city today, so I texted her to see her in the same time. But it got canceled. 

I wanted to go see her anyway, but I felt like it was ridiculous to drive 4 hours to see a girl I met on mdma, so I explained her the situation and I canceled our plans. 

Now, I feel stupid for doing that because I want to see her and I have the time to do it, but I can‚Äôt really tell her that I want to go see her anyway because it is weird, unsmooth and too much. I have to mention that when she accepted to have a drink with me, she told we she was not looking for a boyfriend.

So now I am mad at myself because I am complicated and I didn‚Äôt follow my desires. I am in vacation for the week, I could ask her out again but it feels weird.",dating_advice
t3_dlna5n,Ghosted or over thinking?,"So I‚Äôm 24(F) and I went on a bumble date (w/ 26M) on Sunday evening. We‚Äôd only be talking a little over a week, but both thought getting to know each other is better in person. We have each other on both snapchat and WhatsApp and had been snapping things from our days to each other, and messaging back and forth, never too fast though as we‚Äôre both busy working full time. Just to clarify, a few hours between messages doesn‚Äôt bother me whatsoever, I get life gets hectic and we‚Äôre not all on our phones all day. Anyway, the date.

We met at a local bar for a drink and conversation was great from the get go, then we walked further into town for dinner, we shared a starter and had our own mains, we got to know each other on a better level, talking about our jobs and goals, and all the lighthearted banter too. At the end we even decided to share a dessert when he could tell I wanted one! He refused to let me split the bill and told me a I should never pay for the first date. He walked me back to my car and even offered his arm for me to hold onto. We hugged goodbye, and I said thank you for the evening, he told me to let me know when I get home safe &amp; kissed my cheek.

I text him shortly after getting in (no clue how to play it cool haha) thanking him again saying I had a great time, and an hour or so later he texts back saying he had a lovely night. I reply the next morning general chit chat, knowing he is off of work this week I know not to expect instant responses, plus work for me is keeping me busy so again cool. Expect not cool, as I haven‚Äôt heard back anything from lunch time yesterday. I‚Äôm trying my best not to be labelled as crazy keen, but I can see he is online and posting snapchat stories. I haven‚Äôt gone back again as I can see he has read it, but I‚Äôm now a little confused. Did I do something wrong? 

I have been fully ghosted in the past after a few dates and even when I tried to confront the guy I heard nothing back, and it really knocked me back. I completely understand that nobody owes me anything, and that it was only one date after a week of chatting. But I do feel like if this what online dating is, I‚Äôm going to tap out.

t3_dlqcpo,Sexless relationship,"My boyfriend of almost 2 years wont have sex with me.

Let me start from the beginning... before I met him I was in a long term relationship for almost 5 years. We had a great sex life, very active and healthy. We liked to try new things and always had a great time. 

I met my current boyfriend through and cheated with him (we kissed). I break up with said EX. I moved into this new relationship pretty fast. I fell in love, HARD. Things were great, we had so much fun together. We got serious pretty fast.

I moved out for the first time and two months into the lease he asked me to move in with him, so i did. Then things start to get a little strange, not in the fact that we didn't love each other but he was slowly pulling away sexually. Now it has gotten to the point where we will go 6 months at a time without sex. Not because I dont want to, I try every night and he said I make it 'uncomfortable' and 'weird'. There were times he would cover my face with his hand in the middle because he didn't want me looking at him.

He told me it isn't me, he just doesn't want to have sex? he says he is attracted to me but would rather just masterbate (SELFISH). Now... to me that is weird, and let me be honest I am dying because I want to be with him and only him. It is hard when you dont receive any physical contact, and no real answers. I offered an open relationship, he doesn't want that. Ive looked though his phone, I know he isn't cheating.. is it me? 

I want to have fun, I want to be kinky. I told him I will try anything to make it fun, and still nothing.

What is happening and will it ever get better? I am thinking intimacy issues.. thoughts?",dating_advice

t3_dlkxha,Damn Online dating is rough,"So I‚Äôm trying to build up myself confidence and I made a Tinder account for the purpose of meeting women just to find stuff to do as well as fishing for a potential partner maybe.

It started well when I started getting tons of matches but it went downhill when nobody started answering my messages. It pretty much hit the climax when I matched with someone and we started getting along really well and were making plans to meet. She asked me what I did for work and I told her I was between jobs. She didn‚Äôt take it too well and she started insulting me saying that men with no jobs should not be dating and that I was a deadbeat loser. I reported her in anger but then she unmatched me cause I couldn‚Äôt see any of her messages again.

I‚Äôve now deleted the app because it really hurt what she said and I‚Äôm not back to square one of not having any methods to improve my social connections when it comes to having friends who are girls.

Should I just not try dating or even making friends until I have the perfect life? Cause that‚Äôs how I feel like right now. That I can‚Äôt have any friends or a significant other until I have a perfect life with money and a successful job",dating_advice
t3_dlq5iy,Is this going too fast?,"So I met this guy through a dating app, I know, I was skeptical too. But when we went on the date, we hit it right off. We agreed to go out on another date a week late. At the end of the first date, we kissed. We couldn't wait to see each other and ended up going on a two dates in between the week. Fast forward two weeks, now we are in a relationship and it is going so well that we are terrified.

The catch is this guy is two years older than me, no big deal, but he just got out of an 8 year relationship 2 months ago. After the first date he disclosed to me about it and he told me about how awful she was to him. He said everything about being with me is different from how it felt with her. I asked him if he would ever go back to her, and he swore he wouldn't. He broke up with her before his family could force him to marry her. 

Now we are a couple and every second together is amazing. His step mom is convinced (she's crazy about astrology) that we dated in another life time and we were meant to find each other. When we are alone, we constantly ask each other where we have been all our lives. We could feel ourselves slowly planning our lives together. I know this is crazy fast, but I honestly like everything about him, I have never met a human being that understands me as well as he does. 

Unfortunately, due to him just recently getting out of his relationship with his ex, everyone thinks he is an idiot for ever leaving her. He never disclosed to his family or friend about how emotional abusive she was. His family wouldn't understand that he is dating someone else so we are keeping our relationship a secret. I know how awful this sounds, even I'm insecure about this, but there is no way we can just break up and forget about each other at this rate. We are too attached and fond of each other for that now. 

I'm also in a tough situation with my family so we are both hiding our relationship. The only ones that know about us are our friends and his step mother. He lives with his family which makes it really risky when we go on dates and they don't know where he is. 

My friends all think we are moving really fast, but this guys is the best man I have ever dated and he wants to treat me right. He knows that I'm not straight, I'm a demi-sexual, so when we are in the bedroom together, the chemistry is completely there. I'm the only other girl he's been with other than his ex which makes me nervous because even after his break up, he never went out, never partied or went clubbing, or slept around. 

He is now trying to shape his future better, he wants to graduate university like I did. He wants to get a job that he loves just like I did. He tells me I make him happy in ways his ex never could. We don't want to talk about our feelings too much because we know it's too soon but we know just by being together than we are falling hard and fast for each other. 

I'm so confused because I was always the person hating on sappy, lovey dovey couples, but we have became just like that. I'm aware everything is fast, and no one from his family is going to approve of me because of his recent breakup. What would you do in this situation?",dating_advice
t3_dlmt0r,"I don't know what to do, please help","(Throw away account incase anyone I know recognises anything)

So I started my (M21) first job three years ago. There was another person (F33) that I started to really get along with. I started falling for her instantly. The problem was, at the time she was married. However some time passed and she has gone through divorce. For a while now we have hung out (going out to concerts and exhibits) a couple of times. Sometimes I feel like she is being flirty but I can't tell if that's just her being nice like she always is or if she is into me. I feel like the age difference is too much for her and she sees me more like a little brother than anything.

I am afraid of directly asking her directly because I really like her as a friend and I don't want to ruin that either. She is the first person I've had this much of a deep and personal connection with. Also we work quite closely together everyday and any awkwardness would potentially ruin both of our time at work. 

As a side note I have never had a relationship and I am quite bad at taking to girls romantically. I used to be bad at talking to girls in general before I became friends with her.

What do you guys think I should do? Is the age gap already a red flag and I should keep quiet and forget it? Or are there enough signs to say that it's worth a shot to potentially make my workplace too awkward?

Sorry if I formatted wrong or my sentence structure doesn't make sense. Not the best writer when it comes to this.

t3_dlmo1d,I'm awful at reading people so maybe some advice please?,"So i didn't want to like this guy but i think i do now. The reason I didn't want to is because I know it won't happen, even if he likes me back the logistics of it all won't work,and I think he might realise that too, but I still wanna know. So like not long after we first met he messaged me and we got talking all night and he didn't see me for a while so messaged me another two times and began to be obviously flirtatious in these messages. I was never the first to message until I did once but the conversation ended really early. Anyway, it's bee a few months and he hasn't messaged me since but i see him once or twice a week.I just can't tell if I am special to him or if he is just like this with everyone. So whenever I say him he will always say hi to me and stuff and he'll playfully tease me a lot and I'll do the same back to him, but some of the stuff he says to me he'll also say to my friends. However, the difference is he'll actually try and talk to me when we're alone, but only ever when we're alone. He'll also be extra playful physically when we're alone. He usually always laughs at what I say and we always make eye contact or he'll smile at me in this certain way. The only thing is though, I obviously don't know if he is also like this with my friends because I don't know what they're like alone. I also can't help but feel that I've kinda pushed him away a little bit because i wasn't really being very flirty in text and I kinda rely heavily on jokes and teasing in conversation because i'm quite awkward so i haven't really held a serious conversation very well. I mean I really don't know what to think of it because i rarely get any attention from guys so I can barely tell if he likes me or is treating me the same as everyone else. I kinda wanna ask my friend about it but there's a very high chance that if I do that, that she'll make it very obvious when we're next together, or she'll get jealous and try and prove that she gets attention from him too.

This may sound weird ... but during these few hours I imagine being with her, telling her about my feeling, marrying her, hanging out with her, doing anything I can only imagine with her (nothing dirty tho). I ... really can't stop thinking about her, I've been checking her Instagram stories whole last month. Actually, I have a crush on her not because she is hot or anything like that, but because I truly like her personality and I fell in love with her charming smile ü•∞. She is unique for me, somehow she can easily manage to motivate and inpire people around her. She is clever, beautiful, and most importantly she motivates me (her page is a like a blog, where she shares with others her life stories, ideas and helps other by answering all their questions, she is so kind...). The last time, when I had this kind of feeling, it was 10 years ago, when I was still in a high school (14y old). I am 24 years old, never had any serious relationship due to being socially awkward/foreigner in another country (I am studying in EU). So, that's why I am writing all of this here, I could use your help.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, I can deal with my shit all alone by myself, never needed a helping hand, been living here for 6 years alone without (true) friends and it was okay, but I simply can't sort out this alone. As I said, it's been a long time since I last time felt this way.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why i like her is: As you already know she is amazing, and  actually, she is from the same country/same city I am from, but she currently studies in another part of the planet (South Korea). I really like her because she is so dedicated, smart and even though she studies architecture in one of the Korea's most difficult universities (SKY), she someshow always manages to remain positive and in all of her photos she is always smiling, happy. I've never met her in person, neither in my home country, nor after finding out about her existence. For the first time in my life I actually want to be with someone, with her to be precise. I want to marry her. But for now, I can't really do it, can't neither support her finacially, nor give her a bright future. I am unemployed, need to get my Master's degree first and then look for a job (granted if I even find one). Don't really know what to do, she doesn't even know about my feelings. And let's suppose that I will be able to find a job in 2 years and earn some money to pay for a flight to Seoul + accommodation, that's in the best case scenario, provided I get my degree and find a good job. In 2 years everything can happen: she will no longer be there (she is 3rd year student now and I guess only 2 years are left until she graduates), during that time she might find other man, someone who is close, marry him, I don't know ... I mean, she is beautiful, smart and people are drawn to her like a magnet, there aren't many girls like her, at least in a country, where I come from. And even if I will find a job and go to there to tell her about my feelings, I don't know how she will react. This is actually worrying me, I never had a girlfriend during my stay here and even during my time at school, yeah I am a sore loser lol. I wasn't really interested in finding someone, building relationship and been concentrated on my studies, but I haven't been able to concentrate at all last month, this is distracting me all the time. I can't just simply stop thinking about her and it's depressing me. Can't really describe what i feel really, I think you need to experience the same thing to understand what I am going through...

&amp;#x200B;

I ask myself, would she even be slightly interested in someone this ugly, fat, less intelligent (than her) like me? This might sound like I am exaggerating and all, but I never felt confident in myself. She can have her choice of men, I bet there would a full queue of men, who want to be with her, and I am not really a competitive person, to say the least. For the first time in my life I really need someone's advice, I know that here are people, who are older than me and probably experienced something similar, so if you could share some advice, I would really appreciate it! Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify: I think that I've found a woman with whom I want to spend the rest of my life, but I don't really want to intervene into her life, if it turns out that she doesn't give a damn about my existence. I don't know what should I do and I hate going through all of this and experiencing it.

t3_dlm393,Girl that I thought was keen suddenly went quiet.,"We've been talking for a while now and have met up 4 times. Last Wednesday she came round mine just for a bit and chilled.

t3_dllxp7,How does a 22 year old guy get a girlfriend?,"I feel embarrassed to be writing this because I should know better by now, but I'm in a dark place. I've made a lot of progress over the last few years. I used to be a stereotypical severely depressed loner, the kind of guy the media warns you about. The good news is I've gone from severely depressed to mildly depressed. I've discovered my passion in life, making movies, and I've worked hard for years to make my dream a reality. I've traveled the world, had some amazing adventures. I've built up a network of friends who really get me and that's such a wonderful feeling. I've been told plenty of times how funny I am, how cute I am, how talented, how handsome...

I'm not saying this to be narcissistic. I'm saying this because I feel like I'm doing everything right, but I wind up in the same boat. I feel happiest when I'm working or traveling because I'm *doing* something. The visceral thrill of writing for hours and getting a scene just right or blasting through a whitewater rapid makes me feel alive. It's all about forgetting my inner demons. My strategy was to wait until I'm more successful to start dating so I'd have a much better chance. I'm so close, but without getting into details, my big project has been delayed by two months. That means two more months of living with who I am.

My first instinct was to go on another trip to escape, but I have to stay home so I don't jeopardize my project. The last few days, I've slid back into depression because I can't scramble ahead. The gaping lack of affection in my life blares at me. I'm no virgin. I've been with girls, but not in a way that really counts. I don't just want sex, I don't want one night stands. I want a real relationship, a girl I can feel close to.

I realize 22 is a tough age because you're not teenage / college age anymore, but you can't quite compete with successful adults. I blew my chances with girls at college because I was too depressed and socially incompetent. Now I get the rules of the game, but I'm still an introvert with high-functioning Asperger's. Bars and parties aren't for me. Online dating seems like the obvious solution, but I get the sense that most people my age are on Tinder and that's the opposite of what I'm looking for. If I just wanted sex, I'd cut out the middleman and pay a professional.

I hope you understand my situation. Nothing would make me happier than finding a nice girl to settle down with. If I come across as too serious and intense, it's because I am, but I still have a sense of humor about myself. Maybe I could afford to enjoy myself a little more.",dating_advice

I have no intention to pursue anything more with either one of them and I feel kind of guilty for that.

I asked her out on a date and she said yes so I'm excited about that but I'm nervous about the date.

I haven't been on a date in over a year and I'm worried that i'll either be boring and make it look like I don't wanna be there or that I talk way too much and she doesn't get to have a good time.

t3_dljx5m,Girlfriend follows other guys on Instagram who she meets when she is out with friends. Is this ok?,"My girlfriend is an outwardly flirty and sexual person, and I am not. We do love each other, but she insists on keeping her Instagram public, occasionally posts revealing pictures in her bikini, and without fail she allows other guys to follow her who flirt with her while she out at a bar with her friends, and follows them back. Sometimes she likes their pictures as well. I do not think it is appropriate to give out an Instagram handle, as it seems to be the same thing as giving out her phone number. I confronted her about this several times and let her know that I don‚Äôt think it is appropriate, but she continues to do it, and she thinks it isn‚Äôt a big deal and that I need to trust her more.

t3_dlp3ql,Started seeing a girl and not sure how often I should be messaging her?,"I (23M) just had my first date ever in my life with this cute girl (27F) last Friday and we really hit it off because we found out we have so much in common.  We both love anime, comics, video games, star wars, etc and we talked for hours at a restaurant to the point where we were the last ones to leave and only left because we felt bad for the employees waiting for us so they could close.  

I already have 2 more dates planned out for the next two weeks.  Before I met her I was already planning to go to two comic and anime conventions and asked her if she wanted to join me and she said yes to both.   I bought her a ticket for one of the Cons and she bought a ticket for the other.  Before then though I wanted to go on more dates to talk but she messaged me saying she has a fever and can't meet up for more dates until she gets better.  

Now since this is my first time dating a girl I don't know how often I should be messaging her and about what?   I've already messaged her saying I hope she feels better but that's it and can't really think of how to start any new conversation as I don't want to seem like I'm bothering her.  I don't want to mess this up as I really like this girl and feel bad for not messaging her to keep her engaged in conversation.  We meet up in 5 days for our first convention this Sunday but I don't want to not talk to her for 5 more days until then. 

What if she loses interest or thinks I'm boring? But I also don't want to just start asking random questions like what's her favorite color or something like that just for the sake of conversation.  Plus I want to get to know her better in person rather than over the phone.   We initially planned 2 more dates for yesterday and Wednesday but because of her fever she had to cancel.  

Pretty much I'm asking is it okay for me to just not message her for 5 more days until we meet up or what should I message her about in the meantime to keep her attention. I'm sorry for this long post and if it seems like a dumb question but remember I'm totally new to this and this is the first girl in my life that decided to go a date with me.",dating_advice

Says she really just wants me here and that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs been use to in the past. The next day we decided to call it a ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù but she already removed my name in her social media apps, and changed our relationship to ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù on Facebook and set it to private. I‚Äôve been giving her space and she‚Äôll text me like normal sometimes but then out of no where her responses get spaced out hours between, will forward my phone calls.

Basically, I‚Äôm a 23/f who‚Äôs only been in one relationship that burned short and hot for three months earlier this year. Things were going really well and then he pulled back unexpectedly. I was heartbroken. I regret falling so fast, but it was so easy and comfortable and we matched so well. Anyway, you can probably tell I‚Äôm still a bit hung up on it.

Do I need to focus on getting my shit together and is it selfish to not do that before asking someone to enter your life? I really miss it and I want to find it again but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs foolish, selfish me just looking to feel good.

t3_dlhtc4,I want to date someone who almost became my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend a year and a half ago. Not sure whether or not this is a reasonable idea.,"Characters: Me, 19f. Jessie, 18f. Nick, 19m.

We‚Äôve all known each other for a long time and are in the same social circle. Jessie and I were already reasonably close friends in high school, but now she‚Äôs one of my best friends. When she was a junior and Nick was a senior in high school, they went to her prom together. She later admitted that they had feelings for each other at the time and seriously talked about dating, but decided not to because the timing was bad, with Nick about to go to college and all that. While that was going on, I secretly liked Nick but decided my friend‚Äôs feelings towards her almost-boyfriend were more important than my little crush. Anyway, life happened such that even though we‚Äôre all in college now, we‚Äôre pretty much in the same geographic location and see each other pretty often. Jessie has explicitly stated that she is no longer interested in dating Nick. They have a solid platonic friendship these days, and she clearly prefers that over a potential romantic relationship with him. However, she doesn‚Äôt know that I never fully got over my crush on Nick, and he and I are totally hitting it off. I‚Äôm hesitant to ask him out, and she‚Äôs a huge part of why. On the one hand, they never actually dated, the closest they got to that was a year and a half ago, and unless she‚Äôs flat-out lying, she‚Äôs not into him that way now. But on the other hand, the main reason they never dated was timing and location issues that have since been resolved, and there is a possibility she‚Äôs secretly harboring feelings for him that she won‚Äôt tell me about for some reason.

I‚Äôm a guy in my early-mid 20s who feels so far behind the eight ball at this stage when it comes to sex and relationships in general. While it seems like everyone I know lost their virginity in their early teens, and have since learned and experienced through various partners, I have never had a single sexual partner or any sort of sexual contact with anyone else. 

It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying ‚Äì the only proper girlfriend I‚Äôve ever had (six years ago, maybe more at this stage since I stopped counting some time ago) was too scared to ever try anything, and I‚Äôve been on my fair share of dates but nothing has ever led anywhere. 

After being ghosted by a girl after a number of dates and us discussing getting serious with things about two years ago, my already fragile self-esteem had taken enough of a beating and I just stopped trying really after that point, especially with graduating and working taking primary focus around the same time. 

Right now, I feel like I‚Äôm at a point where I can‚Äôt see anything ever happening. Obviously, it would be stupid and na√Øve to write it off completely, but I‚Äôve reached a stage where I‚Äôm just not sure how something would and feel like I‚Äôd probably stuff it up due to my inexperience. 

People know me as being incredibly charismatic and easy to talk to and get along with. I have a lot of confidence in my personality, but the same can‚Äôt be said for my looks. I put a lot of effort into trying to look as good as I can, but I‚Äôve never received what I‚Äôd consider to be a genuine compliment regarding my looks ‚Äì unless you count most of my friends‚Äô mothers, weirdly. I should note I‚Äôve lost a considerable amount of weight recently (put some of what I‚Äôd lost the first time around back on after that whole giving up on dating thing) and get the odd positive comment about that, but I still struggle to get past my visually-related insecurities stemming back years, even if I look much different now to how I did as a kid. 

Alright, sob-story out of the way, where I‚Äôm at now is at a stage where I feel like I want to start trying again because I‚Äôm scared nothing will ever happen if I don‚Äôt act fast enough. Every single one of my good friends I can think of bar two are in long-term relationships (and those two both regularly manage to hook up with others a lot) with some now married and others engaged, meaning I struggle to get out and meet anyone through them anymore. With my tertiary studies over and me working remotely and in a very male-dominated area, there‚Äôs little chance to meet anyone there either.

And given my phrasing of it in such a way as ‚Äòmeeting someone‚Äô, I think it‚Äôs fairly clear that some random hook-up isn‚Äôt exactly what I‚Äôm after. You may mock, and a lot of you probably will, but I‚Äôd always wanted my first time to actually mean something I guess, as I‚Äôve found that I personally need to have an emotional connection with someone to feel a proper physical attraction for them (ie. more than simply finding someone ‚Äòhot‚Äô).

Besides, I feel like the sort of person who would only be after a hook-up wouldn‚Äôt want someone with *literally no experience* who is almost certainly going to be a terrible root as such. I feel given my situation of being totally sexually inexperienced at what feels to be this late in the game, someone who would be understanding of that situation is almost certainly required. 

But given it seems like all the good ones are gone or however you want to phrase it, I‚Äôm just not sure where to find people like that. I‚Äôm not sure Tinder (which I‚Äôve admittedly never tried) is the place, especially since I feel that given my self-esteem issues surrounding my *totally fine to everyone else* but *ugly to me* looks an app where I‚Äôm judged off my appearance isn‚Äôt exactly for me, plus it seems like most people on there are mainly after hook-ups, which, as noted, they probably wouldn‚Äôt want someone like me in that case. 

I don‚Äôt drink so going to bars isn‚Äôt really an option, and given a lack of good ones where I am they wouldn‚Äôt be even if I did. Aside from some chance meeting that would only ever happen in a TV show or movie, I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. 

And even if the time comes, I‚Äôm worried that the fact I have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm doing in the sack might ruin my chances if the person is not understanding of that. My closest friend, a girl who is the only person I feel I can really confide in about any of this, reckons I don‚Äôt really need to mention this to a prospective partner, but I‚Äôd personally feel like I‚Äôd conned them if I didn‚Äôt since I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd figure it out soon enough. 

So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm not sure how to meet people given my situation, and if I did actually meet someone who wanted to do the do with me, I wouldn‚Äôt bloody know how. Any advice you have will definitely be appreciated and taken on board since I think it‚Äôs fairly clear that I need some. And even if not, thanks for reading my ramblings anyways. It at least feels a bit better out than in.",dating_advice

t3_dlkg27,how do you know if someones really changed?,"Keeping it vague bc person of discussion browses, so forgive my ambiguity. 
A long time ago i fell in love, and seems i never really got out of it. After years apart without contact i assumed i was over them, but low and behold after reuniting, my feelings havent much changed.
We had dated many times and each time it ended in tears. They were a POS to me really, and everyone hated our relationship. But my feelings for him were so strong, i just donned some rose colored shades. They were narcissistic and controlling, and as soon as i wasn‚Äôt fun anymore i‚Äôd get dropped. 
After the many years apart, and spending a lot of time with them recently, i cant help but feel like they‚Äôve changed and really seen the error of their previous ways, and they apologize profusely for how bad things were before and promise a future of love and happiness together. I love them so much it pains me, but im petrified that things will just go right back to the way they were before. 
Even scarier, the thought of being happy for a couple of years, getting married and starting a family, only to have it crumble when i cant afford to start anew.

There are a couple profiles that are a definite ""Yes"" that actually have some information about them, that I find attractive (nerdy and active) and a similar amount of definite ""No""s (overly religious).

However, a vast majority of profiles I see are just picture of them, with a couple of words tops in the bio. I'm not the kind of person to just swipe on looks alone, so it feels weird for me to give 90% of the bumble population a blanket right or left swipe.

How has it become so normal for women's profiles to be so uninteresting? I can't imagine that most of them are getting success out of this. I recognize that some people do this for Instagram followers, but that's not everyone, but it just seems like a waist of time for everyone involved.",dating_advice
t3_dlnnh1,She wants to take things slow. Confused!,"Backstory:

I met this girl on tinder about a month ago, the weird thing is we have lots of mutual friends and one of them actual tried to hook us up before we even met as she thought we would be a good match. So, we met up and had a great first few dates. We were texting every day and it seemed really promising. The third date we were literally all over each other, there was so much sexual tension so we agreed to meet up the following weekend where we got absolutely wasted and had sex. Afterwards while still plastered she opened up to me and admitted we kinda rushed into it and should of waited but she also said she wasn't going anywhere and she wanted us to fall in love and some of the usual drunk talk but still, very promising. The next morning she said she felt bad because that was probably the alcohol talking and wasn't sure that's what she meant. We still spent the rest of the weekend together and had a nice time, still kissing, cuddling and fooling around. I was sure she was into me as all the signs were there. We were even beginning to arrange plans/trips for the near future. Then came Monday and while still texting she told me she wanted to chill a bit, take things slowly and not rush into anything serious. We continued to text each other and the nature of the messges was just as it was before (flirty etc) I'm just confused as to what she meant by this. Things did seem to be moving at a very fast pace which was fine by me but I'm not sure what to do next or if I was coming on too strong. Should I give her some space? Or continue as we were? Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Just for reference we are both in our early 30s and she has had some really bad experiences with men.",dating_advice
t3_dlk8p9,LDR worthy?,"
I (25F) moved to a bigger city after finishing graduate school, and secured a job in my field right away about 1 year ago. However, I didn't realize how lucky I got, and that in this particular city, the jobs in my field do not have much room for upward growth. So, about 2 weeks ago, I started applying to jobs out of state with great opportunities, better salaries/benefits, and clear paths for upward growth.

Just over a month ago, I started seeing C (28M), and connected immediately, and the feelings have been intense and mutual. He's been so incredibly supportive with me taking an opportunity about 6 hours away and has truly encouraged me to do what's best for me. However, everything with the job and move is happening quick, I have about 2 more weeks together in the same city. He's the total package, and I feel like so much of our lives were so fate driven that we just happened to cross paths. It seems like he feels the same about me, and has expressed similar sentiments. With such a short time though, am I taking it to be more than it truly is?

He's expressed liking the city that I'm moving to, but hasn't said anything other than that. Knowing that I'm leaving, and there are a lot of feelings, and knowing that if I continued living here, we'd be seeing each other, what do I do? Is it best to just break it off early?

t3_dln77f,Dating While Separated? Yay or Nay?,"I'm sure this has been discussed here about a million times, but am curious. 

My situation is pretty straightforward. Married for three years with no kids, no house, no debt, etc. I moved out in April and have been very much living on my own as a single person since then. We don't speak unless it has to do with the divorce and there is no drama between us (a little animosity, but I expected that since I was the one who left him). We've filed, but nothing has been finalized yet because everything is a waiting game with the court system. 

I've been dating again for about two months. Before anyone judges me, my relationship was very over before I got the courage to leave. I'm still young, but not that young, and don't feel like I should have to put my life on hold when I am really ready, emotionally and mentally, to date again. 

I'm on two dating apps and used to put it right in the bio but that got me some real weirdos, for whatever reason. So since then I have been out with maybe five guys. I was upfront with all of them on or before the first date, and shockingly, none of them cared. 

However. Just had a guy totally freak out on me on an app about it. And I can see his side...it seems sketch, and a little weird. But I really am a completely normal person, and my marriage didn't work out for valid reasons. Like all I can say is that we are very broken up, it's just unfortunately that our break-up requires a lot of paperwork. 

It made me wonder if I should just put it right back in my bio again, to avoid anyone feeling like I'm hiding something. Or if I'm okay doing what I've been doing, and bringing it up on a first date.

Yet I also don't want anyone to feel like I'm being deceptive, because that doesn't make me feel great either.",dating_advice

All in all, I was surprised by how much we had in common... and then I looked back at the conversation and realized that he might be hinting that he‚Äôs into me. He never mentioned any girl in particular during our conversation, and the whole thing about wanting to meet someone organically lines up nicely with the fact that we already know each other reasonably well.

In actuality, over the last 2 years or so, we‚Äôve matched on Tinder/Bumble, 3 or 4 separate times.

t3_dlmuo8,Bi-Polar Boyfriend is Giving Me the Silent Treatment,"  

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a few months and we committed pretty quickly. He was always very consistent and proactive with our relationship. I‚Äôve met his whole family a few times, and he‚Äôs been a constant fixture in my life. All was well until a week ago. He is bi-polar and I think he has taken a downswing mood-wise. Suddenly he was distant, not reaching out to me or following up when he said he‚Äôd call. So I gently brought it up to him, asked if he was ok, did he want to talk and he brought me a flower and apologized and just said he was really stressed and running on no sleep. So I left it at that. Then a few days later we were meeting for a movie. He gave me a meeting time but when I got there I texted him and he said ‚Äúsorry, forgot, running 20 min late.‚Äù So I was bothered by that as he‚Äôs been punctual every time and if it was reversed he‚Äôd be furious. It felt like he wasn‚Äôt putting effort into the date anymore, like I was an afterthought. During the movie I diplomatically mentioned I felt something was still up, that he wasn‚Äôt putting in the usual effort. He got really mad at me. Like ‚Äúhow could you ever say that to me, I had a terrible week, I‚Äôm tired, and x/y/z excuse. You can never speak to me like that.‚Äù I apologized profusely, even though I‚Äôm not really sure I did anything wrong. I‚Äôve never seen him that angry. He stayed the night but left the next morning in a huff saying he needed to recharge and was still angry about what I said. I texted him after he left, saying I‚Äôm sorry and I care about him. No response. He gave the silent treatment all weekend, which he‚Äôs never done. I was so upset. By weekend end I was mostly angry because it felt cruel and unfair. And again, I don‚Äôt think I did anything that would make his behavior acceptable. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do now. He‚Äôs still ignoring me other than responding to my text saying we needed to talk with ‚Äúsounds good to me!‚Äù That also made me feel sick to my stomach, as if he was being smarmy or as if he didn‚Äôt care.

Am I going crazy here or is this guy acting nuts? I don‚Äôt think I did anything that would warrant this reaction, and I think this is about his own guilt or wanting to push someone away who was trying to get close. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I feel torn up about it. Thoughts??",dating_advice

t3_dlg9em,Clueless about the possibility of getting back together,"I posted this in the BreakUp community, but got no response.

This is going to be a long post. I'm a 23 year old girl who is experiencing her first breakup. The breakup happened on September 26th, 2 days before my birthday. 

The relationship lasted for almost 4 years. We met in first year in college, when I was 19 and he was 18. We are studying physics and the flirting started when we were discussing about solving problems and the material in general. We're from different cities, but it wasn't really a problem for us since we were seeing each other every day in classes, and after them. We survived the summers without seeing much of each other because we weren't really able to make the commute, but again, it wasn't a big problem. In the beginning of the relationship I told him that I have 2 deal breakers - the first one was no sex until I have only a few exams until graduation, and the second one was cheating. I also told him that if he doesn't agree not to do these things, that we shouldn't even start a relationship since it will be a lot harder to break it once emotions are present. He said that he doesn't mind these ""conditions"", so we started to build a relationship.

Since I'm from Europe, in our second year, I spent the summer in the US, on work and travel program. My ex didn't come with me even though I asked him to. When he finally decided to pick up the phone, he missed the deadline for applying by a few days. So I went alone. I wrote a journal for him about what was happening with me for the whole summer, and then 3 more months when I got home because I wanted to finish the whole notebook, cover to cover, and I gave him that for our anniversary. Since we didn't see each other for 3 months that summer, I somehow ended up breaking my word in a sense, and from then we started to have oral sex. Fast forward to the next year, I got genital herpes from him and I survived the biggest physical and emotional pain in my life in that period. I thought about breaking up with him, but my motto in life is you don't give up on the people you love, you give your best to make it work. And I did that. 

Everything was fine, or so I thought, until this summer. My ex went to a conference in a different country, with students from our college. I didn't because I couldn't afford it. I was bothered by my ex not asking me whether he should go. I've never stopped him from anything he wanted to do or say. I was never jealous. Anyways, the internet reception was very bad, and since he was on the conference, we couldn't really get in touch. One day we had a small argument. On that day he made out with one of the younger students from our college, after having a few beers, apparently. He told me this a day after he got back. He wanted for us to split right away, but after a lot of crying from the both of us, and a lot of begging from my side, he agreed to think about it. He said he'd need a month to think about it, but that was too much for me, and I didn't want to ruin my birthday which is in the end of September, so we agreed that we'll talk about after 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks I never said anything about our relationship and where we're headed.

Before we met after the 2 weeks we agreed on, he broke up with me on the phone (we were in different cities) for the first time. 5 hours after that call, he called me again and asked me to get together, which we did. When we met in person, we talked about everything, but the biggest problem was our future. We always wanted to apply for scholarships and to go to a different country on postgraduate studies. I asked him if he'd do that I wasn't able to go with him because he's a better student than I am and there is a real possibility for him to be accepted, but not me. His definitive answer was 80% he won't do it without me. But after the cheating, I cannot agree on us living in different countries, and I told him that.

In the next 2 weeks, from September 15th, the more we talked, the more I had a feeling that we would fall apart. The last straw was arguing about my birthday. I told him repeatedly that I need him by my side on my birthday party, and he didn't want to come. He said he didn't want to act like everything is alright when it isn't. But I didn't see it that way and I still don't. We had that fight for a few days and it really hurt me. We broke up 2 days before my birthday. Since this is my first relationship, and I'm an introvert, I asked him to come to my house on my birthday so I could have a last kiss and some hugs. And he came.

We decided to try and stay friends because we're colleagues and can't really avoid each other in college. But also because we care very much for each other, or so I want to think. After we broke up we talked about what happened, but I'm still confused. He insists that we want different things - his priority in life is career, and mine is family, but I honestly don't think that we couldn't make the relationship work because of that. He keeps telling me that I did nothing wrong, and that I'm a very good person with a lot of qualities, and yet he left me. I can't make sense of it. At first I cried a lot, then I was numb for weeks, and now I'm very emotional. This Saturday we're supposed to meet because he has to give me back the books I borrowed him. When we were chatting today, I was telling him how I really am and he asked me if I still have feelings for him. I replied with, I'm not crying these days without a reason. And then he asked me if I wanted to talk about us on Saturday.

I have no idea what to expect. I invested everything I had in this relationship. I was blindsided by its ending. In the beginning I said that cheating is a deal breaker for me. After the breakup, I kinda understand him because other things came to surface, which I couldn't believe. It turned out that my ex kept quiet about all the little things that bothered him, even though I always insisted that we should be open and honest about everything, so we can solve problems immediately and not have them again. He kept quiet until he snapped and cheated. 

This is the biggest psychological trauma I've ever experienced. And I've been depressed long before the breakup. And now I have no idea what to do. We had a lot of beautiful moments together. I thought he was the one, until he gave up on us. Now he wants to talk about us, and I don't know what to do. I still love him, and I think he still loves me, but sometimes love isn't enough. I have no idea what to say if he wants us to get back together. I'm clueless and my whole life is on hold because of this...

t3_dllu0g,I'm starting to get scared of my crush,"I (F17) recently have a crush called Peter (M17) who is in the same class as me. In the beginning we did long stares but I didn't think much of it. Then one time we were walking the same way to the train station so we had a conversation. He told me that he likes the way I think. He even acted like a gentleman and opened doors for me and even suggested to go a route where you go through a building, so I won't be cold.

Few days later I started to act coldly towards him, because I noticed that he gets along with my friend Ashley pretty well to the point that I thought he had a crush on her. Since it seemed my friend also has a crush on him, I hoped they will get together. So whenever I would talk to my crush I would talk something good about Ashley.

Later Ashley, me and few others went to Peter's place for a school project. A friend of his had to leave early, so we all decided that we leave too. But I jokingly said that I still have time and that I could stay a little bit longer. Peter probably didn't want this because he responded with an obvious excuse to make us leave. I felt rejected and thought I should finally forget him and move on. But when I got home, I got a message by him which led us to play an online game together the whole evening.

There was an upcoming event. I already planned to go with a friend to that event. I then casually asked Peter if he's going there too. He said no but suggested that we two could go together and that it would seem like a date. When he said date, he leaned in to me and kinda whispered 'loudly'. I responded with a confused expression while Ashley who was standing next to us kinda freaked out. He then said, that he just wanted to see Ashley's reaction. After that we three went to the train station together. Ashley left and Peter suddenly asked me when we're gonna meet up for the event, even though I told him that I'm already going there with another person. I said to him that he could go with Ashley since she also wants to go. He didn't respond to that.

I ended up going with him to the event anyway. He then mentioned that a friend of his actually asked him if he wanted to go there before me but he chose to go with me. The whole day felt like a lovey dovey date because for example he told me to hold onto his jacket so we don't get seperated because there were so many people. He casually would compliment/flirt with me and react cute when I compliment him. Sometimes he would even pull my sleeves when walking or when I wouldn't eat he tried to feed me with his food. He also often asked me if I want him to carry me so I can see more, but I declined. He also said that we should meet up more and planned that I go to his place next week to play games together. He also mentioned that his parents wouldn't be at home.

On the next day in class, he suddenly got very flirty with Ashley, even in front of me. He even carried her when she let him. Later Ashley told me that Peter was staring at her a lot since she was wearing a tight top. I was so confused. Suddenly his attention was nowhere to be found. When he talked to her it seemed like I wouldn't exist. But then in the next moment, he would talk to me again.

This all make me think that he might be playing games with me and it makes me scared of him because I don't know what's going on in his mind. His flirts seem too natural and perfect. It made me search the traits of a player and almost everything fit to him. But at the same time we're not a couple or anything like that so I'm not in the position to think that I'm special. He's pretty talkative and extrovert so maybe that's just him being genuine. Still, all these weird actions done by him give me a weird feeling which make me be scared of him. I still like to believe that I'm just thinking too much.

Is it normal that I'm starting to get scared of my crush after he's been showing weird signs or is he actually acting fine and I should stop worrying? What are his intentions?",dating_advice

t3_dlfzvz,How do I move on from liking someone I meet and hangout with almost every day of the week?,"So I'm 18. Freshman college boy. Fell for someone who I grew super close to over my time here in college. I know I'm stupid for falling for someone so quickly, but that's just how I am. This is the second girl I've ever truly fallen for. And I hate the fact that I can't move on. Or at least, I hate the fact that my feelings for her at this point are detrimental to my emotional well-being and are impacting my studies negatively. 

How do I get rid of my feelings for her? Or at least, what can I do to try and have it affect me less?

Edit: she's also 18

Edit 2: here's some extra context. I've already asked her out a bunch of times and she was down all the time but I never specified them as dates. When I confessed, she told me she wasn't looking for a relationship yet. We're both still straight and single and religion isn't a problem for us. We're really close friends and it's not like anything is awkward between us.

I tried to compare my current situation with the last girl I fell for. With the last girl, when she rejected me, we still hung out together a lot the same way I still hang out with this current girl a lot. But I don't know why my feelings for the last girl didn't bother me in the slightest.

I concluded that maybe it has something to do with what the said when they rejected me. The last girl told me that she just doesn't see me that why while this current girl said she isn't looking for a relationship yet. I guess my brain took that reason and went ""maybe there's still a slight chance,"" and so that's why I can't really move on? I don't even know anymore.

I have acted desperately in other women-related romantic situations, so I tried to stay cool about it and not creep her out.

She did invite me to join them at one point and, while I don't think they dislike me, I don't believe I made a great impression because I was running on low sleep and I got so tired that I even stopped taking after a point which made things a little awkward (for some reason, I was more focused on the fact that I wore the wrong socks than on what was actually happening around me)- I realise I probably should have left before this and I clearly wasn't thinking straight. Ever since, we've only kind of smiled at each other and made some uncommitting eye contact. 

As for her friends - they haven't made much contact with me since. I think I have enough confidence to approach her/them, but I keep getting the feeling that I'll come across as intrusive.

I might have done some damage, but I don't think it's completely irreparable... Any ideas? Or did I blow my opportunity?",dating_advice
t3_dlkzw2,Interested in a damaged woman,"I've met a woman that I have strong feelings for, and in some ways it has been reciprocated.  We text all day, we've made out a bunch, slept together, she sends me nudes, and she says I'm ""very attractive and interesting"".  But she is also super messed up.  She self harms, has been sexually assaulted, and suffers from cptsd.  She's prone to periods of depression where she doesn't want to see me.  She doesn't want a boyfriend, because she gets claustrophobic.  She doesn't like it when I say sweet things to her and thinks its cheesy.  Her capacity for romance is so diminished by past trauma that she can only see things through the eyes of a cynic.  Sex is just sex. She's given up on love.  It's all very transactional.  


Gaining her trust has been very difficult.  I'm navigating blind here because she doesn't communicate her feelings very well.

How can I face him tomorrow?",dating_advice
t3_dlkqob,Is she (22f) playing games with me (23m?) or am I just being jealous and over thinking?,"So I recently met a girl at a party. She was really into me and initiated it first. We got along really well, and me who has hardly any experience with girls, was too scared to make a move. So at the end of the day I shook her hand told her it was great meeting her. However, she gave me her phone number and said we should hang out sometime, she told me how much fun she had that day.


So a week later we went on a date, we went to the beach, go kart and watched a movie. We had a lot of fun and we kissed at the end of the day. She told me she had a great time and she can‚Äôt wait to see me again. We took a picture at a photo booth. I posted it on social media and she told me it was really cute and she really enjoyed herself.


So I thought it was going good. It seemed like the start of a relationship. She told me she really wants to see me again, called me handsome and charming, all these compliments etc. I felt really happy for a bit.


(Quick background info) As long as I‚Äôve known her, she‚Äôs always been a bad texter. Always replying hours later, the next day, or not at all. I don‚Äôt have a problem with this. It just makes me sad, but I understand she can‚Äôt always be on her phone, and she‚Äôs busy with work. She apologized for being a bad texter and I told her it was okay, that we‚Äôre both adults and I understand that she‚Äôs got important things to take her of. So then she told me thank you for being patient and understanding with me. The texting thing doesn‚Äôt bother me too much but I mention it because it leads to my next part.


Often, during these texting sessions where she doesn‚Äôt reply for hours, Instagram shows me that she‚Äôs active online. Posting/liking stuff. So she‚Äôll be on her phone but not replying to me at all, which makes me feel like she doesn‚Äôt really want to talk to me. The way I see it, if she really did have interest in me, wouldn‚Äôt she be wanting to talk to me as much as she can and not responding whenever she feels like it? I‚Äôm very self-critical and start thinking negatively things like ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs just leading you on‚Äù.


Anyways, she told me she was going to a concert a few weeks ago. On Sunday I asked her what day is she going, I told her I‚Äôd like to go out again but I wanted to know what day the concert was so I don‚Äôt plan anything on that day. Turns out it‚Äôs on the day I had in mind. It‚Äôs fine, she‚Äôs seeing her favorite band so we could go another time. She told me she wants to hang out again and that she misses me.

Anyways, while we‚Äôre texting, I went on Instagram and saw she just posted a photo with some guy, out on the town at a table having lunch. Then my jealous self starts wondering who this guy is, why are they together? It‚Äôs not her brother, so who is he, just a friend? Then later that day, they went to a pumpkin patch and she posted a photo of her time at the pumpkin patch. 


So now I‚Äôm thinking, aren‚Äôt pumpkin patches just for couples going on dates to take cute pictures? Who goes to hang out at a pumpkin patch with a friend? I wouldn‚Äôt. Second, she posted a photo of this little date, but she didn‚Äôt post anything from the time we went out (I know I‚Äôm coming off jealous, but how should I react to that?). I give her space because my sister dates a controlling freak and I never want to be like that to a girl.


Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it, just being a jealous guy cause she‚Äôs out at a pumpkin patch with some guy, but what else am I supposed to think. I know we weren‚Äôt officially in a relationship, but it seemed like we were doing really good. I stopped pursuing other women, and deleted all the dating apps because I had a really good feeling about it.

We dated for 3 months on the program and then when it was over we decided to do long distance having a goal in mind of her coming to visit me in my home country at the end of the year. She came to visit and we had the most spectacular month together. When it was time for her to go back home we both decided to end the relationship as doing long distance didn't seem viable anymore. Doing long distance killed us the first time and to do it a second time would have been hell. It's been almost year since then and I still haven't moved on. We talked on and off since the break up.

I pretty much always buy a snack from her (reaping that sweet 50% off employee discount) towards the end of the day and we chat for a while. 

I know she's just being friendly as part of her job, but she always asks me questions first (stuff like ""so you had a busy day huh? how was your week? any plans for next week?"" etc.) and pretty much one-sidedly keeps the conversation going (whereas I don't really see her chatting to anyone else, but I suppose we have a friendly rapport).

t3_dlj895,In the process of getting ghosted the second time by the same person and I feel like exploding,"So after some rough introduction to online dating life, I (27m) finally ""got the hang of it"" and got some nice dates, including one that felt like a 10/10 match(\~21f, not sure anymore to be honest). I may be exaggerating, but the date had everything. Deep talk, connections on pretty much every niche and weird nerd hobby we had, we went to multiple locations since no one seemed to want the date to end plus a bit of cuddling and holding hands.. sadly no kissing on the first date since I just pussed out, but no biggie.

After this first date she told me immediately that she will be out of town visiting family for 3 weeks and sadly won't be available for dates during that time. That was also when she stopped answering my messages. I thought that was the classic ghost. I mean, who does that? Even if she is out of town, who can't even send one message in 3 weeks? So I just moved on with my life (after - of course - venting my frustration in this subreddit...)

What do you know, after pretty much exactly 3 weeks she actually sends me a message if I want to meet. After 3 weeks of nothing I was a little irked, but eh, why not give it another shot? I really liked her after all, so I gave her the benefit of a doubt.

We went to see an amazing movie and continued where we left off. Except we started making out heavily in between the deep talk. Again, moving to pub after pub, no one wanting the date to end and at the end we even walked the entire way home just to spend more time together. And you know what? This time she sent me messages like her life depended on it after the date. Kiss emojis and ""where are we going next time"" kind of messages. So we met yet again, and it went similarly great, we stood in the rain for an hour and did nothing but kissing and laughing like in a bad romcom and I was over the moon. Same messaging energy afterwards, + she mentioned that I should definitely come meet her roommates and stuff like that. So, I deleted all dating apps again and was ready to update my venting post from earlier with a huge ""THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS""- post and all that. (I know. I know.)

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, so I think she is about to ghost me again. I asked her when we should meet next and all of a sudden, ""come meet my roommates"" became ""I can't make it this week, I'm pretty busy"" with no further suggestions. So I asked her what's up and she said ""nothing, just busy."" and she hasn't answered me since then. This was two days ago. For context, her response time while we were meeting was like 20 minutes tops.

&amp;#x200B;

And, I. Am. Furious. I didn't mention anything of it, but I can't help it. How can we go from a week of chatting every waking minute + having amazing dates, Saturday standing in the rain kissing to sunday ""yeah, we won't meet and I won't tell you why"". Even if she DOES answer back after a while, how should I react? how is such a behaviour ok? If there is someone else, why did SHE message me back and arranged for the dates and stuff just to drop me a week later? Heck, I would even be ok if there was someone else, we haven't even talked about what's going on between us, how could I fault her for anything, but getting absolutely zero information after all that is such a bad feeling I can't even describe it. Just being nobody to her all of a sudden and not worthy of any explanations in the matter of hours.

t3_dlduza,Should I text her ?,"Hi folks.

I was about to give up on online dating after many unsuccessful result on Tinder/Bumble/OKcupid when I received 2 notifications on Facebook dating.

One of them was a girl that I was attracted on Tinder but we never matched... Well I send a like to her profile too and we started to talk.

At the beginning it was cold, She never answered to my introduction but 2 days later I tried again to start the talk... Still cold as ice, short messages from her. I was about to gave up but I had the feeling that that girl might be a nice person so I pushed more and she started to talk and introduced her to me, it was cool we talked for a few days in a row. I found out that we have got a lot of common points, it was very cool. She told me that she will be on vacation for one week but I asked her if she would be okay to go on date when she comes back from her holiday, she said yes.

Now it's been 5 days she came back from her vacation and today she changed her profile picture from our conversation but no word from her.

I'm coming to you to know if I should go to her and ask her how was her vacation then ask for the date or wait a little bit more before starting a new conversation with her. I don't want to seems like the guy who were waiting for her because he is desperate you know :D... It's the first time I'm asking for advice online but I feel a bit lost with those new way of dating people, I always meet people in person that's why I don't know how to act online.

t3_dlia7g,Do I have a crush?,"So, my first post on reddit is a question about love, not what you'd think, also, sorry for any spelling errors.

Anyway, so, there is this guy in my class that I'm friends with (he is 17 and I'm soon to be 16). But I've been starting to feel different about him. I think about him more often than usual, I get kinda exited/happy when he texts me, I often find myself glancing at him in the classroom and some times I even think about wanting him to look at me and I'd catch him staring.

Maybe some of you think I'm an idiot for not knowing if this is just normal friendship or if I have a crush on him, but I've just never felt love in a romantic way before so I'm new to this.

t3_dli7uj,does having space to figure out what you want really work?,"Currently in a situation where we both got super overwhelmed with how things were progressing but I‚Äôm okay with being overwhelmed because it means I felt something real this time. However, I (f18) also agreed with him (m20) that it would be a good idea to have some space to think about our lives and stuff. He told me he doesn‚Äôt want me to wait around for him but that he doesn‚Äôt know if space will change anything. He had doubt halfway through dating for a month and i wasn‚Äôt worried about it because I had a little bit of doubt at the beginning too. And since we just started getting to know each other/dating I wasnt trying to rush things. And my family said to me that if you didn‚Äôt have any doubt then your feelings wouldn‚Äôt be real because when you truly like someone a lot, of course you‚Äôre going to be doubtful from insecurities and you tend to become more insecure about yourself when you start to really like someone. And it made sense. I just hope that he realizes how much he‚Äôs lost sooner rather than later because he‚Äôs always told me how much of a great person I am and I think that scares him, or makes him feel like he‚Äôs not good enough for me even though I‚Äôve told him multiple times that he‚Äôs more than enough for me and that I‚Äôm not some perfect person either.

t3_dli2du,Am I doing something wrong? For those who started dating in late 20‚Äôs,"Idk is this is allowed but I‚Äôm posting again because I want more people to see this and give me their opinions, thoughts and advice.

Sorry in advance if this is long and messy. 

So I am in my late  20‚Äôs (f), and while I don‚Äôt believe that I am too old to never have dated anyone, when comparing to the group of people I grew up back in my hometown, I am the only one who has never dated. I have never kissed anyone. Have never been sexually active. Most of these people are either married or already starting a family. I don‚Äôt live in that town anymore but often times hear about them and how someone else just got married or how someone else is having a child. 

I am bi, so finding people attractive and being attracted to the has never been the problem. I truly don‚Äôt know why it is that I have never really been approached by someone who was interested in me. Although this isn‚Äôt entirely true, when I finally understood and acknowledged that I was bi, there was someone I started talking to but because I was living what I felt was a monumental time in my life, I wasn‚Äôt looking to date anyone then, I felt like it was a time for me to just fully, truly, and deeply be me. Plus, we were living far away from each other and I never saw them with intentions of dating, we were just friends but they developed feelings for me and I didn‚Äôt. Previous to that I had one major crush on someone I meet in college and almost made a move on them because they had been the first person I was starting to have feelings for, but I never made a move. This person was someone I truly wanted to date, even after much time had passed I would think about them and feel such regret that I didn‚Äôt asked them out. I did eventually stopped thinking about them. A couple of years ago, I meet someone else. I felt right away that I wasn‚Äôt going to like this person but boy was I in for a surprise. I‚Äôve always known what I want in life and from someone else, I‚Äôve always known what I want in a partner, and this person had it all, checked all the boxes. Except they were in a relationship. So you know I liked them but because they were dating someone else nothing really happened, I never said anything to them about my crush. However they tried to use me as a rebound and even if I really liked them that was something I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with, I just felt that if they liked me then they needed time to process their breakup and then we would talk if they so desired. But of course that never happened because they were just looking for a rebound.  

So I guess my question is, if you have been in a similar situation, what did you do to start dating? I feel like this is the step I‚Äôm stuck in. I don‚Äôt have low self-esteem, I do however am some who doesn‚Äôt do well in crowds so I‚Äôm usually uncomfortable there. I don‚Äôt really like to go out dancing or to bars because I‚Äôm just not cool with people just getting into my space simply because I‚Äôm out there dancing. I don‚Äôt do bars because I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt have many friends and I truly don‚Äôt know why this is. I never have people approach me, it sometimes feels like people don‚Äôt even notice me. I feel like I have so much love to give and so many things I want to experience with a partner yet it seems like no one wants that with me. I have never felt upset about it until recently, I see so many different couples, all kinds of couples so I just don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt have that as well?  

Anyway have any thoughts, advice or just anything to say about this?",dating_advice
t3_dlhxvz,Am I being played?,"Hey all, I‚Äôm new to reddit &amp; this is my first time posting.

I (25f) started talking to this guy (29m) thru a dating app about two months ago. Obviously when we first got to talking it would be all day long, quick responses, etc. Then I noticed he started replying much later and with responses like ‚Äúlmao‚Äù. Since we started talking, we‚Äôve been on a few ‚Äúdates‚Äù. We‚Äôve slept together almost every time and the sex is great. But I realized that he doesn‚Äôt ask me any questions about my past, my day, and just doesn‚Äôt seem interested in my life in general. He doesn‚Äôt like to share much about his past either, he gives vague answers or dodges questions altogether. I‚Äôm always the one to ask about the next date and make plans. He never says he misses me unless I say it first and ‚Äúmisses‚Äù my calls. I‚Äôve confronted him about these things because we‚Äôve both admitted we like each other and he says it‚Äôs because of how much he hates his current job and being tight on money makes him feel bad we can‚Äôt do much when we see each other (even tho he buys designer items). I knew money was a problem for him (&amp; I‚Äôm not balling either so no judgement) so most of our dates would be me going over to his place. And I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôd rather hangout in his room than not at all and he shouldn‚Äôt feel bad. But nothing has changed.

Am I being incredibly naive and delusional? Is it super obvious that this guy is just using me for sex and telling me he likes me just to keep me around? I want to believe it‚Äôs just difficult for him to open up but I honestly feel like this is just a physical thing at this point.",dating_advice

t3_dlhfhz,Casually dating ex that dates her ex..,"Long story but I'll try to keep it short. About 4 years ago I was engaged to the love of my life with a baby on the way. She ended up leaving bc I had a drinking problem but have since gotten it under control, 3 years sober. In that time she got into a serious relationship for about a year and half. The guy was in my daughter's life and seemed okay but broke it off bc he decide he'd rather not have kids or be a stepdad. For the last year they have been friends with benefits pretty much. Once she starts dating he comes crawling back and she drops whoever for him. Now to me, we eventually started taking family trips and for the past 3 months have been hooking up. She texts me everyday, is affectionate, etc. Until he comes around then I get ghosted. We're both single and she says she needs to work on herself and she needs time to get to know me again. She gets mad if I ask about him. Sometimes she'll say they hang and others she won't. She goes back and forth on what she says. I really care about her and the trips made me realize what I'm missing with a family that's together. Ive always been involved in my daughter's life, every weekend and some weekdays but doing things together with the kids brings me so much happiness. As well as the alone time with her, I cherish it. But how is it so easy to spend the entire weekend with me then have him over and sleep with him? I need an outside perspective. Do I stand a chance? She claims she doesn't want him but I'm the first one dropped when he comes around. My head is spinning. What are your opinions about this and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",dating_advice

I‚Äôm sure this comes off as though I‚Äôm just being petty, but I really mean it. 99.99999% of people will understand if you simply say ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not interested in you.‚Äù

I see people constantly trying to break down these tiny messages people hide in their conversations, and I know from experience that it just eats you up inside. So as a group of (somewhat) mature people, can we all agree to simply be extremely blatantly obvious when we don‚Äôt have any interests? It would just make the world a better place.

t3_dlcxaj,"I like a Girl(Not a very good title, sry)","(I‚Äòm 19, M)
She is a girl(19) in my friends group and i like her. It‚Äòs not like im in love with her but i find her really interesting as a person and i love to talk to her. We‚Äòve been friends for 2 or 3 months and text each other every few days. Everytime I text her she seems like she is very uninterested but everytime she writes me first she is very enthusiastic. Sometimes she just texts me with a story she just witnessed at work or in public and just asks if we want to hangout. When we actually hang out we have a great time and we talk about lots of things but even then when I text her first she‚Äòs very passive, even though we had a great time and seems very active when she texts me first and actually hang out. We‚Äòre both 19 and never were in a relationship before. 
It‚Äòs complicated because she is part of our friends group now and i dont want to complicate things. I really like her as a friend but sometimes i feel a kind of attraction that i can‚Äôt regulate. 
I‚Äòm just confused and maybe she likes me but is not consistent at showing it or we are just good friends. I think i can see the signs of a girl but she is playing on it like a metronome. I don‚Äòt want to lose her as a friend but also I can‚Äòt stop thinking about the ‚Äûwhat if‚Äú scenario.

He asked me if I‚Äôd like to go out last night, and I said sure, how‚Äôs 7? I had to run an errand before hand and told him I would send him a text when I was on my way.

I got there on time and he wasn‚Äôt there so I waited about 10mins before sending a text letting him know I was there, another 20mins go by and I was starting to get cold so I went to a local coffee shop and waited another 10mins or so before he told me he was just leaving a friends and still needed to go home to get cleaned up and ready, so I asked him how long he thought that would be. He didn‚Äôt answer that but said he was confused because he hadn‚Äôt thought we‚Äôd set a time (even though we had) so I kept waiting, and after another 30 mins I said I‚Äôm going to go home, it‚Äôs getting late and cold, unless you‚Äôre nearly here?

t3_dletny,Is it wrong if I don't like black girls? Need advice.,"Hi everyone, I usually don't get attracted to black girls.

I can feel the difference literally. I don't differentiate between people (girls/boys) on the basis of color at all. I have a lot of friends who are black like on the top of head I can name 20 who visit my home or I visit theirs twice a month &amp; I have a lot of friends who are white.

But not for relationships and future with the girl. I just say a clear No when I see any of these

1. She is black.
2. She plan to keep a boy cut forever.
3. She is too much into makeup and her Instagram
4. She curses a lot &amp; doesn't respect people in general.
5. She doesn't even plan to grow in a career and earn either fame or money.

I've been getting criticized a lot because I recently said a No to a girl (who met me two weeks ago in a bar &amp; we danced a bit) who proposed to me &amp; she is black. I told her I don't like her. (I didn't mention the reason to her ofc).

This is what lead me to think about this question ‚Äî I‚Äôm 2.5 years clean, and really do not struggle with any sort of cravings or urges to relapse. I don‚Äôt follow any sort of NA or AA-type program. I still casually and socially drink, I smoke weed sometimes, and every few months I might use some molly or LSD for fun.

Is it unfair to keep this information from him for that long, presuming we keep dating?

t3_dlgst5,Would it be appropriate if I (17F) started seeing my former crush's brother (19M)?,"For context: I've had a bit of history with my former crush, let's call him X. We were pretty close, and a few years ago, I developed a crush on him, but I don't think of it as anything seriously since we were young and stupid back then. When he found out though, we did not talk ever again after that (long story short, he kinda hated me). Then one or two years later, he was interested in one of my friends. They started dating and stuff, and I was totally fine with it since I was already over him. I was chill, ya know. But my friend VOLUNTEERINGLY left our group so she could hang out with his group (they were cooler, I guess), and so we had a minor conflict. Nothing bad, until she brought up the topic of me liking X, and spoke about some of the bad things he told her about me. I still didn't care, just laughed it off, until X randomly came at me and was like ""why did you kick \[my friend\] out of your group"", and a bigger fight developed from there. All in all, I still think it was just a misunderstanding. I might have despised them in the heat of the moment, but honestly, I don't hate any of them. I don't think they're bad people,  I just believe that in the circumstances, we just weren't able to show the best side of each other.

Anyways, fast forward a couple of years, they're no longer a thing BUT X is interested in ANOTHER one of my friend lmao. Because of this, we all started talking to each other again, it was awkward at first, but I've kinda just put everything behind me, so I gradually became more comfortable. We started hanging out more, including his group in general. However, I don't know if I could say the same for him, because I keep on getting the impression that he is not very fond of me? X has confirmed to me that he has no reason to hate me so he doesn't, but he's not really the kind of person I can easily trust since I'm aware that he does tend to talk crap behind other people's back. Despite that though, he is actually a really generous person, but I'm just unsure if it's sincere or if he's just trying to get on my good side in order to get closer to my friend, right? Am I just being too paranoid?

Getting to the main question now, like I've mentioned, since I've been hanging out with him more, ie. going to his house (because the group occasionally meet up at his house and play games or pool, stuff like that), I've been seeing his brother a lot, and started getting to know him. After our first meeting, I couldn't stop thinking about him lol, so I attempted to talk to him. It didn't go very good, but not bad either (having social anxiety isn't easily lol). But after a few more meet-ups, we got a LOT more comfortable with each other. He would often offer to drive me home, etc. and is just so nice lol I love being with him (I'm trying not to fangirl as I'm typing). BUT it got to a point where X was aware that I was interested in his brother, and he was CLEARLY uncomfortable with it, and I don't blame him? I understand his POV. What made me sorta sad though was that for a few weeks, he completely avoided me, and I felt that by being selfish (liking his brother for my own desire), I was risking my newly restored friendship with X, and also his relationship with my friend (??) -&gt; that's what he said? (they're not official yet but like nearly there) because I was making him uncomfortable so he didn't want to hang near us anymore?

SOoo... I told him I did not like his brother for friendship's sake. But that was before his brother shown any further signs of interest, and ASSUMING he also returns the same feelings for me, do you think it's a good idea for me to have an intimate relationship with X's brother? Or would it be an unhealthy relationship- is there too much at risk?",dating_advice

I relunctly agreed and said Yh sounds fun and left it at that because I thought that‚Äôs her saying no .

I then thought about it despite the obvious signs and said I would be down for a date with u tbh and not ur friend . She then said oh I already asked her so that‚Äôs another sign I guess

I said well let me know when it‚Äôs happening and she ignored the message : 

the thing which confuses me is that this girl  without a shadow or a doubt pops up to me  every single time we then talk for a while and I then wen we are done with the convo I say I‚Äôll message her later if she isn‚Äôt busy Like today we spoke for a bit (whilst she is at work instant replying ) and tells me to drop her a message later when we are done talking

I‚Äôm just curious is she just trying to make a friend now Because she needs a guy to talk to? I definitely need a girl to talk to as well so it works both ways and she has helped as we spoke about both our exes .


It just surprises me that she always pops up to y story on snap and starting conversation with me

t3_dlg0wy,I'm worried that I'm being led on,"Hello,  this is my first post here as I've been seeking advice about my situation. 
I M[26] have been talking to girl[22] for about 5 months now. She lives about an hour and a half from me and we only get to hang out about one weekend day 2-3 days a month. We text daily and call 1-2 times a week. 

The first time we ever hung out we watched movies at my apartment and after she got home that night she told me how much she appreciated me being a gentleman that respected her and  didn't just talk about her body/looks or try to go straight for a home run with her. She also said she really wanted to kiss me but wasn't sure if I'd be okay with it (she is big on consent) which i absolutely respect.  There have been two times since then where I've asked if I could give her a kiss on the cheek to which she happily agreed with.  

She recently felt close enough to me to tell me that earlier this year she was a victim of sexual assualt by a long time close friend. This is something that's put her in a very dark place and she views sex as sacred to her (though she's non-religious). She finds it difficult to trust and get close to anyone now.  

Fast forward to this past weekend (5 months later) when we hang out we will cuddle or hold hands and she laid on a pillow on top of my lap.  She let me feel her back and even play with her butt a little, but that's as far as that went. Both of those were huge steps because she feels uncomfortable about any backside touching since her assault. By the end of it all it was a nice and unfortunately short hangout,  but still no kiss.  I don't want to be rude to say I was expecting one, but it's been 4 months that we've physically seen each other when she mentioned wanting to give me a kiss. She told me that she is starting to really trust me and we have gotten closer with physical touch.


I want to be as respectful as I can be and I hate to sound like a jerk, but it's just felt a little frustrating to be so patient. I really don't want to rush her in healing process. She told me she's a wreck that doesn't expect me to pick up the pieces and she doesn't want to throw all this on me by rushing a relationship.

I get it and I have huge respect for her and I don't want to hurt or use her. 

So my question for advice; does it seem like I'm being led on? Am I still going about this properly? 

Should I bring up our first hangout where she made a comment about a kiss? 

Any advance will be appreciated,  thank you.",dating_advice

t3_dlfni4,5th date with a model she cancellled twice," 

Hi Guys,

So I've been dating a beautiful Brazilian lady who's 22F and I'm 26M.

We had a great first date where we ended up making out all night long. I then traveled for business for a week and she initiated drinks when I got back. Drinks went well with kissing, banter etc. 3rd date I cook for her at my place and we end up having sex, she left her bra at my place on purpose (""I'm going to leave this here). 4th date was supposed to be at her place and she cancels, so I asked her when she was free next and ended up at her place 4 days later, she cooked me dinner and did a really sexy striptease and then had some of the best sex I ever had. During the 4th date, I proposed to go watch a movie two days later and on the day she cancels due to x. Ok, so I broke my rules (If she cancels the second time she will need to reschedule) and asked if she still wanted to see it to which she replied ""Don't go without me!!! Tomorrow night works for you?"" so I tell her sure and then on the day she cancels 1 hour before the movie and I replied, ""No prob, maybe some other time"". 

What do you guys think? I know flakiness is never a good sign but I'm planning on texting her in 4-5 days if she doesn't establish contact (She's a model but also a masters student, I don't really want to next her without trying my best. I also very stupidly forgot an expensive watch at hers... really dumb I know). Cheers!

TL;DR: Really like a super gorgeous lady. Had sex twice and went on 4 dates, one of which at her place where she cooked for me. She cancels the 5th date twice and not sure how to feel about it.",dating_advice

We communicate clearly on we‚Äôll meet again etc. things have been going well so far except for where we‚Äôre going with this because before him I‚Äôd planned on moving countries, that is still an option except I also kinda want to see where things go with him.

If things go well, I might consider staying where I am and continuing with my current job. Still early but I am keeping that option open.

Anyways I met him through tinder. I did delete my account soon after matching him (because I was annoyed by people on the app). Now I don‚Äôt know if he is still active on there or not. 

However, given that we have been intimate, I feel the need to know if he‚Äôs dating other people. However, I don‚Äôt want him to feel like I‚Äôm putting pressure on him to only date me so early on.

Been dating this person (28F) for a little over a month now. Honestly, I‚Äôm just taking it really slow because she‚Äôs actually the first in a while after getting out of a LTR.

But am I missing her cues of disinterest? I‚Äôd try some physical flirting which she does not really do, and I do understand some people are just not touchy. I‚Äôd text her something flirty but nothing on her end. But she did text me during her trip out of town (which I did intrude because trying to do the right thing, haha). We do seem to have a great time in person during our dates, etc.

Ok so here‚Äôs the thing. She‚Äôs invited me to her place a few times now. We would have some drinks, watched Netflix, and chatted for hours. But nothing got physical.

         ok so im f (19) and theres this guy (20) that I have feelings for but I never really talked to him. Everyone I know ships us together. We have the same dark sense of humor and taste in music, basically the same person but opposite genders( been told by multiple people including his sister). He has a few textbook signs that a guy like you, but I dont know if he likes me or if im just overthinking it. For example whenever we are with a group of people he always looks at me when someone says something funny or when ever we are debating something or having a game night he always sides with me (idk if thats because were so alike or maybe cuz he likes me).  One time a friend sent a picture of us to him and he said that we were cute( like was he just being nice or am I way over thinking this). I see him maybe once a month because we have full time jobs, and go to college. I would try shoot my shot but my friend( the one who sent picture) likes him A LOT ( like obsessed) and he keeps on dodging her.  I dont know if hes dodging her because shes annoying or because he once mentioned doesn't want a relationship, like I always say that too but do want a relationship but with the right person.  is he saying that just cuz or does he really not want anything. not to mention we arent close at all but we grew up together( we have a looooot of mutual friends) is he just shy? does he like me? does he want a relationship?

Second date was dinner and seem to be going well, we had a good conversation. But I got more and more uncomfortable throughout the date and couldn‚Äôt figure out why. At the end she said she wanted to see me again, and then she went in for the kiss and kissed me passionately like six times. Yet I felt really confused and weird when I got home.

So a quick little backstory: 

‚Ä¢I'm 22 years old(f) 

‚Ä¢Boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years

‚Ä¢We just moved in together in April of 2019

‚Ä¢I'm currently studying to get a PhD in Neuroscience 

‚Ä¢I recently had two jobs but due to getting bullied at work adding to my already severe depression ( yes I went to HR, nothing happened to the person ) so I left that job

‚Ä¢ I now have one job where I work maybe two days a week, leaving me unable to afford to feed myself let alone pay rent

* recently had an argument where he blamed my depression and education on why he couldn't do anything better with his life and when does he get the chance to do that :/

My mother became worried so I told her what was going on. She told me to come live back home until I get on my feet again. But my long term boyfriend has told me if I move out we're broken up and I've spoken to him about it but he won't see my pov.

I guess I'm more so trying to see if what he's doing is right or wrong in your opinion. I'm worried I'm maybe not seeing it right either so yeah :x

I dated an ex for about a year until I finally decided to break up with him for good. No one liked him though and the reasons were valid. Of course, being young and having my first real boyfriend, I put my foot down every time. I get it, you want to protect your friend, sibling, child, or whatever but you HAVE to let them fall flat on their face to learn and I wish my former friends and my mom understood this. My mom would tell me all the time she didn't like him because she was ""so sure"" that he was married. I never found out if he was or not but I always had a gut feeling that I was more than likely his side piece.

Today, I'm in a wonderful relationship with a man who knows how to treat me the way I'm supposed to be treated and vice versa. I don't just thank my ex but I thank every other guy I've dated for learning from each one on what I did and did not want in a relationship.

So I am in my late  20‚Äôs (f), and while I don‚Äôt believe that I am too old to never have dated anyone, when comparing to the group of people I grew up back in my hometown, I am the only one who has never dated. I have never kissed anyone. Have never been sexually active. Most of these people are either married or already starting a family. I don‚Äôt live in that town anymore but often times hear about them and how someone else just got married or how someone else is having a child. 

I am bi, so finding people attractive and being attracted to the has never been the problem. I truly don‚Äôt know why it is that I have never really been approached by someone who was interested in me. Although this isn‚Äôt entirely true, when I finally understood and acknowledged that I was bi, there was someone I started talking to but because I was living what I felt was a monumental time in my life, I wasn‚Äôt looking to date anyone then, I felt like it was a time for me to just fully, truly, and deeply be me. Plus, we were living far away from each other and I never saw them with intentions of dating, we were just friends but they developed feelings for me and I didn‚Äôt. Previous to that I had one major crush on someone I meet in college and almost made a move on them because they had been the first person I was starting to have feelings for, but I never made a move. This person was someone I truly wanted to date, even after much time had passed I would think about them and feel such regret that I didn‚Äôt asked them out. I did eventually stopped thinking about them. A couple of years ago, I meet someone else. I felt right away that I wasn‚Äôt going to like this person but boy was I in for a surprise. I‚Äôve always known what I want in life and from someone else, I‚Äôve always known what I want in a partner, and this person had it all, checked all the boxes. Except they were in a relationship. So you know I liked them but because they were dating someone else nothing really happened, I never said anything to them about my crush. However they tried to use me as a rebound and even if I really liked them that was something I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with, I just felt that if they liked me then they needed time to process their breakup and then we would talk if they so desired. But of course that never happened because they were just looking for a rebound.  

So I guess my question is, if you have been in a similar situation, what did you do to start dating? I feel like this is the step I‚Äôm stuck in. I don‚Äôt have low self-esteem, I do however am some who doesn‚Äôt do well in crowds so I‚Äôm usually uncomfortable there. I don‚Äôt really like to go out dancing or to bars because I‚Äôm just not cool with people just getting into my space simply because I‚Äôm out there dancing. I don‚Äôt do bars because I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt have many friends and I truly don‚Äôt know why this is. I never have people approach me, it sometimes feels like people don‚Äôt even notice me. I feel like I have so much love to give and so many things I want to experience with a partner yet it seems like no one wants that with me. I have never felt upset about it until recently, I see so many different couples, all kinds of couples so I just don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt have that as well?

Growing up I was raised by just my mom. She has had many traumas and mental issues.

To boil it down she was/is paranoid that I will grow up to be like her and basically instilled this weird combination of falling love is the best/always be afraid that people want to take advantage of you. Particularly guys. She, unsurprisingly, had two failed relationships which resulted in my siblings and I. Because of that and her other mental health issues I grew up over analyzing everything and never really grew close to any of my friends.

I was ALWAYS trying to be a ""good"" kid. I never wanted to give my mom any issues. I lived afraid that if I drew any bad attention to myself we would be taken away and I needed to be there for her.I was always trying to support her and never really lived for myself until the last 6 years or so . NONE of which is her fault ! I did that to myself as a young empathetic dumbass in over her head.

So,  later in life I started playing ttrpg's, made real friends, got a job and finally moved out! I'm so freaking happy! I had ups and downs with my Mom but there is a healthy balance now. I'm fucking THRIVING on my own!

I ALWAYS filtered life through overthinking and then giving up. So lately I've tried things out that I ""forbade"" myself. Being completely open with people who care about me, trying drinking, attending party's, creating and idk being a normal human?

This is where dating is becoming an issue. I daydream about romance A LOT. I never want kids or a dream wedding in my future but a person to be with would be nice.I understand though that fantasy is reality. However I've never dated anybody. The one date I did go on (middle school) was with a perfectly nice friend but I was going because I felt it would ""complete"" or fix me. I realized it was REALLY unhealthy and crappy to do so I broke it off pretty much right away. I didn't have any feelings for the guy other than friendship and I was projecting.  So based on that one experience I thought I was Ace.

Brilliant.

So after realizing I have  issues and working with a therapist on my past....I was just afraid of relationships and being vulnerable. So I've been working on that and tried flirting at a small party. The guy I was flirting with is a friend of my best friend. I honestly think he is a really funny cool person that I would like to get to know even as just a friend. However when I was attempting to flirt.....

It was so bad. Truly awkward as hell. I wish to die.

When I spoke to him like a normal person it was great and easy! However when I TRIED to be flirty and talk with just him I proceeded to inner panic mode. This was even further set off by his joking lewd comments (guess who has two thumbs and is also an virgin? This gal! Who woulda guessed?) and being slightly buzzed I probably gave the worst impression of myself. Its like I was simultaneously giving off ""lets be friends!"" and ""I'm sorta kinda flirting!"" vibes. This poor guy......I'm truly stupid. I got his number (and another friends as cover because I was so flustered by the whole thing....like dear god the mixed messages) but I haven't texted him at all.

So after the party I told my Bestie what has up. Him being in a wonderful longterm relationship (with a kickass queen of a G.F) has significantly more dating and relationship experience. I turned to him for advice and to vent my shame.

He proceeded to laugh his ass off and told me to ""Chill the fuck out and just talk to him like a normal person. If he's interested in will progress naturally and if not at least you might be friends"" however he told me he would casually ask him what he thought of me and the party when they next hangout.

So reading that whats do you guys think? Should I keep trying or since I'm happy with my life continue focusing on me? Thanks for reading!

t3_dleqfg,So this girl is interested in me.... I think,So this girl (I'll call her Beth)[19] is interested in me (25)  I know this because  today she called me out for flirting with other girls at work. We met at work at I have been playfully  flirting  with her since well we started back in August (Restaurant  recently  opened so we all started at the same time). We aren't  together  or anything  and I've asked her out multiple  times  but she seems to be always busy whenever I ask her out. And that's fine I understand she has her own life but I'm shooting my shot and well I thought Beth wasn't  interested so I moved on to other girls.

t3_dl7tqk,"I recently read a research article which states that 48% of men between the ages of 16-75 have sent women unsolicited dick pics. In your experience, would you say that this is accurate?","Because as a straight white Canadian man in his mid-20s, that number scares the hell out of me.

For those of you who haven't heard about this study, you can read about it in [this](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7xgaje/men-who-send-unsolicited-dick-pics-are-bigger-narcissists-study-finds) Vice article. According to the Montreal-based Society For The Scientific Study of Sexuality:

&gt; More than 1000 self-selecting straight men, ages 16 to 75, were recruited from various social media sites, a university-based research participant pool and Amazon Mechanical Turk to take part in the study. . . . Nearly half (48%) of those surveyed admitted to having sent an unsolicited dick pic in the past.

Based on these results, would it be safe for me to assume that in my personal life, among all the men that I have ever met, roughly *half* of them have sent a woman an unsolicited dick pic at some point in their lives? If I were to list out all of my male friends on a sheet of paper, can I safely assume that one out of every two of them has sent an unsolicited dick pic? If I see a pair of men talking to each other at a caf√© on any given day, it is more likely than not that at least one of them has sent a woman an unsolicited dick pic?

I know that dick pics are depressingly common, but I never thought that roughly half of all men have sent at least one in their lifetime to a woman who was not openly receptive to it. I thought it was a small minority of internet trolls and self-absorbed boneheads who get off on sending their dicks to as many women as they can, in the hopes of getting some kind of response.

I've never been more ashamed of being a man than I am when I read that number. 48%",dating_advice

t3_dlc35h,Found an old friend on Tinder,"Hey,

I've been trying out Tinder for the past week... No luck. My matches have been either ignored or went no where.

Well, tonight I was doing some swiping and I came across an old friend. I sat next to her in middle school and would casually talk off and on through high school. Funny thing was I had a huge crush on her but I never made the move. She's like my biggest regret because I'm pretty sure she felt something with me as well.

So I obviously swiped right on Tinder... but that just leaves me thinking if there's something more I could do. Tinder has been a loss cause since guys get hidden by a sea of other guys. Who knows if she will even see my profile?

Luckily, she actually goes to the same college as me. I unfortunately haven't seen her at all this entire semester. I used to see her off and on and we would maybe say ""Hi"" or a wave but nothing more.

Other than that, I don't have any contact with her at all... I still remember her last name and I found her on Facebook, but I really don't know how to approach this. I'd add her, but I haven't talked to her in over 4 years and probably haven't seen her in over a year. I feel like adding her on Facebook randomly would make things odd? She also has her instagram listed on her tinder profile, but I don't have an instagram and that feels even worse if I make an instagram specifically to talk to her.

Any ideas on how I could establish communication and lead on from there? And once I do, how the heck do I actually know if she's interested.",dating_advice

When he goes back to school though he kinda ghosts me. We will snapchat back and forth maybe once or twice every other week but one of us doesn‚Äôt reply. It‚Äôs SO CONFUSING  but I‚Äôve gotten used to it being that way. ANYWAYS

I‚Äôve come up with a few ideas on how to ask him out or simply start off with a ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs go get Taco Bell‚Äù or something and i plan on doing that when he comes back home for thanksgiving. I‚Äôm going to my friends wedding in Minnesota In June of next year and i want to ask him to be my plus one. I‚Äôm just so nervous from past relationships trauma (complete fucked up shit.

We have a lot in common and get along really well; I enjoy every single second with him. However, I am really not sure how can I open up to him and start talking about our relationship.

When we hang out, things are pretty nice even though we are both really shy. Then, it gets heated and we end up making out here and there. When we are not together, communication is not as heated or as exciting. There is no flirting over text and we have never talked on the phone either. Our conversations are mostly about politics and other nerdy things and rarely about ourselves. He has recently started giving me compliments but nothing else. We have not really talked about where we want to go with whatever we are right now and I don't know how I can initiate the conversation aka break this ice.

You might think that a month is not much time and maybe I am expecting things to move too fast. I am getting a little anxious because I really like this person and want to be with him, yet I don't want to blow it away by sounding needy and asking for a hard commitment (I do want a commitment though).

We‚Äôve gone on 4 dates, texting each other every day when we are free and the chemistry is so strong that we are feeling it‚Äôs getting serious. But it‚Äôs a dating with deadline because he will have to go back to his own country in mid-January next year, so we both know it won‚Äôt last very long.

On Sunday in our fourth date, he again told me that he is not interested in seeing other girls anymore. So I guess we are exclusively dating now.

But also on Sunday he brought the serious problem up ‚Äî we will have to leave each other in two months, so he is afraid if we keep seeing each other like this, we are going to be heartbroken at the end. He also said every time when he felt he is getting serious with a girl, he is nervous and afraid. I said I don‚Äôt mind if I‚Äôm his girlfriend or not, we don‚Äôt have to label our relationship, just enjoy the time spent with each other.

Also we had sex for the first time that evening and the condom broke, even though I took a pill as soon as possible, this accident still gave him a lot pressure. (He didn‚Äôt even cum at that moment so the pregnancy chance is really low)

Yesterday when I talked to him in text, I could feel that he is a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù. So my female instincts made me to open Tinder again, only to find that he updated his Tinder profile just few hours ago(rearranged the order of his photos).

t3_dld3lz,Need advice in how I [M26] should proceed,"Obligatory: Excuse me if some parts aren't clear. English is my second language. Also I am not a good writer.

I need your opinions on this. First of some backstory:

‚Äã

First off: -We are both university students

-There are no more than one or two messages of each other during the day. Honestly, it's mostly because she doesn't answer fast and I don't wanna message too much.

There is this girl I currently talk to. I met her during a ""flatmate casting"". That's basically us looking for another flatmate, not sure how you guys call this. We had an ad up for the free room, some people who were interested messaged us and we met up in order to decide who's best for us. She was one of them. We had to decline her (basically because of my other flatmate), but since I had nothing to lose I asked her if I should show her around the city once she moved into the city. She actually said yes, she would like to. We met up during her first few days after she moved. I showed her around the city, some good locations for drinking, food, etc. During that she dropped a hint that it would be cool, that there should be a ""bar hopping tour"" (I can't rephrase it properly), since some of those locations look quite interesting from the outside.

I got the hint and asked her to do so. We set up a date and went for it. During the supposed meetup she already mentioned that she could not be on time and asked if we could delay it for about an hour, as well as that she could not hang out that long because she had to get up early due to some circumstances. I told her that it would be okay and that it would be also okay to reschedule another day. Her answer was to just delay it for about an hour. My personal mistake was choosing the first location. We had to sit opposite of each other, which didn't allow me for some light touching (I'm inexperienced, so I read up some stuff online and this was mentioned fairly often). But we had a great conversation and a drink or two. Afterwards we went to another pub, which was not a good choice either because the other guests were kinda oldish (no offense there) which led to a. weird(?) atmosphere. I can't describe it properly. The whole evening lasted for about ~3 hours. After that she said that she should go now, because she had to get up early (as mentioned before). So this was no surprise for me and didn't look like an excuse (unless she planned it beforehand).

After parting ways I told her that I had fun and she said that she did have fun aswell. A few days later I asked her if she wanted to go minigolfing. Her answer was yes, but she couldn't confirm it for 100%, because she had a lot of stuff planned during the week and sunday would probably be her only day off. I said sure, no worries. Message me if you any better.

Sunday comes and she messaged me, that she could not follow the plan because she's been exhausted from too much partying. I said something along the lines of, that it's okay and we've all been in this position and wished her a relaxing sunday evening.

‚Äã

Now I need some opinions on the following:

-how would you guys understand my initial meetup idea (showing around through the city)? Would you guys consider it just as a friendly thing or could I expect that she had the idea of a date aswell?

-how should I continue approaching this situation, I don't wanna only text ""hey [...] wanna do XYZ"". But texting about other stuff takes a few days with her, because she replies pretty slowly.

-any other things you want to tell me based of this small story?",dating_advice

t3_dl8j2p,How should I [M26] proceed,"Obligatory: Excuse me if some parts aren't clear. English is my second language. Also I am not a good writer.

I need your opinions on this. First of some backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

First off: -We are both university students

\-There are no more than one or two messages of each other during the day. Honestly, it's mostly because she doesn't answer fast and I don't wanna message too much.

There is this girl I currently talk to. I met her during a ""flatmate casting"". That's basically us looking for another flatmate, not sure how you guys call this. We had an ad up for the free room, some people who were interested messaged us and we met up in order to decide who's best for us. She was one of them. We had to decline her (basically because of my other flatmate), but since I had nothing to lose I asked her if I should show her around the city once she moved into the city. She actually said yes, she would like to. We met up during her first few days after she moved. I showed her around the city, some good locations for drinking, food, etc. During that she dropped a hint that it would be cool, that there should be a ""bar hopping tour"" (I can't rephrase it properly), since some of those locations look quite interesting from the outside.

I got the hint and asked her to do so. We set up a date and went for it. During the supposed meetup she already mentioned that she could not be on time and asked if we could delay it for about an hour, as well as that she could not hang out that long because she had to get up early due to some circumstances. I told her that it would be okay and that it would be also okay to reschedule another day. Her answer was to just delay it for about an hour. My personal mistake was choosing the first location. We had to sit opposite of each other, which didn't allow me for some light touching (I'm inexperienced, so I read up some stuff online and this was mentioned fairly often). But we had a great conversation and a drink or two. Afterwards we went to another pub, which was not a good choice either because the other guests were kinda oldish (no offense there) which led to a. weird(?) atmosphere. I can't describe it properly. The whole evening lasted for about \~3 hours. After that she said that she should go now, because she had to get up early (as mentioned before). So this was no surprise for me and didn't look like an excuse (unless she planned it beforehand).

After parting ways I told her that I had fun and she said that she did have fun aswell. A few days later I asked her if she wanted to go minigolfing.  Her answer was yes, but she couldn't confirm it for 100%, because she had a lot of stuff planned during the week and sunday would probably be her only day off. I said sure, no worries. Message me if you any better.

Sunday comes and she messaged me, that she could not follow the plan because she's been exhausted from too much partying. I said something along the lines of, that it's okay and we've all been in this position and wished her a relaxing sunday evening.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I need some opinions on the following:

\-how would you guys understand my initial meetup idea (showing around through the city)? Would you guys consider it just as a friendly thing or could I expect that she had the idea of a date aswell?

\-how should I continue approaching this situation, I don't wanna only text ""hey \[...\] wanna do XYZ"". But texting about other stuff takes a few days with her, because she replies pretty slowly.

\-any other things you want to tell me based of this small story?",dating_advice

I thought I'd just try and see if this is something advice from kind strangers might help me out with. Hope this question fits the subs rules.

First off; I'm 25y male and am very awkward in meaningful relationships with woman. I can't figure out why exactly, but it's there like this as long as I can remember. I do have a lot of friends (male and female) and am generally quite confident with myself and in a lesser way confident ish with my body.

Over the past years I've actually had a couple girls hit on me in a very obvious way. Though my fear of fucking things up (mainly upsetting someone by misreading their signals) has always made me lock up in all of those situations. Even though I keep telling myself to not be scared the next time, it's something I can't seem to control. My whole life has been evolving around treating everyone equal and to never make anyone upset or dislike me. I usually see this as one of my best qualities but my fear of making someone disgust me by making the wrong move just locks me up into a place where I'm starving of some phisical attention. Not even sex or anything, but someone to hug and someone to talk to and show affection and love to.

It's starting to really depress me to have a lot of friends and quite some girls with whom I have great relationships and even potential for more but to now have the fear I'll never be able to get over this and continue the rest of my life lonely.

I'd take any advice on this really; harsh, obvious. Anything. I've told myself so many times it won't matter to try it once but the logical reasoning gets overshadowed by my impuls to not upset or disgust anyone.

t3_dlc3tr,Why do people who are interested push away?,"Hello there. I work at a big retailer right now. I just changed jobs from working at another big retailer. Over the summer I inadvertently got close to a coworker. She was new and I had been there for 2 years. We both worked in the garden department and slowly warmed up to each other.

This girl also befriended another female employee who worked in the paint department. She would probe me with questions like ""what do you think of (insert name)"". I was the type of employee that went to work, put in my hours and went home. I didn't actively seek relationships or friendships at work, they just kind of happened. I responded to these types of questions with ""I don't know, she's a good coworker I guess, she's fun to work with"". We ended up talking to each other quite a bit, with it getting flirty. She would send me pics of her lying in bed with only her underwear and bra on, and communication was generally just sexually charged.

I had learned from a previously failed dating attempt to strike while the iron is hot. I knew that she was super into smoking marijuana, so I asked her if she wanted to. She ended up backing out a day before we were supposed to hang out, and then she just stopped talking to me. She went from talking to me all the time to not at all. I stopped getting snaps from her, and so I started initiating. The way she spoke to me conveyed a complete lack of interest in continuing talking so I just left it alone. I ended up leaving this job, and after I did, I heard from my friends who still work there that she was extremely into me, EXTREMELY into me. I was shocked because she didn't make this clear, she cut off contact. Apparently she was sad that I left and spoke about how much she liked me to coworkers.

My question is, how does something like this happen? If you truly are interested in someone, why would you cut off contact? Wouldn't it be much simpler to just tell the other person how you feel?

I guess you could say I was just happy someone finally decided to take the time to get to know me. 
     My boyfriend is a gamer. Which I have no problem with. He likes to stream and talk nerdy to me. I love it. I love his quirks. But since the beginning he has had a screen addiction. I didn‚Äôt quite notice how extreme it was..Don‚Äôt get me wrong I knew what I was getting into. I was prepared. 

     But it seemed to have gotten worse as our relationship progressed. Almost 10 hours out of the day he is on his phone or watching YouTube game plays. I can sometimes be in the middle of a conversation and he will just press play on a video or he will be replying to his friends on discord. Sometimes walk away from me while being on his phone while I‚Äôm in the middle of speaking about my day. 

     Even in the beginning of our relationship he would pull out his phone or immediately play a YouTube video RIGHT AFTER we had sex. There wasn‚Äôt even a minute in between. It is fine to keep in touch with your buddies on discord,  I understand. They live far away and he enjoys taking to them. But I sometimes wonder where I fit in? I feel like I am not heard anymore. My emotions and my voice just goes in one ear and out the other. 

     My boyfriend also has ADHD and says him being on his phone is to help him. But I am not really sure if that is 100% the case. He pulls his phone out to check reddit at EVERY stop light. He pulls his phone out while taking a wizz, he has his phone out when eating. It is like child and their favorite blanket. I have written him letters, I have tried to speak about it. He just gets angry and either doesn‚Äôt speak or blows up on me. I asked him if he minded we BOTH start being more in control of how much time we spend on our phones. 

     Like (Get off your phone an hour before bed *due to the fact that we both have insomnia and staring at that screen makes us both awake* Set a limit on how much time we spend on our phones a day, when we are out to eat or watching a movie don‚Äôt pull your phone out) All of these attempts failed. 

     Things finally took a turn for the worse on our mini vacation with his family. We had a 13 hour drive out of town he didn‚Äôt once want to speak with me or hang out with me. Once we arrived to our destination for his brothers musical *the reason we were there in the first place* ... He spent half the day on his phone. I just wanted to genuinely spend time with him and his family. But it seemed like he was forced to spend picture after picture to his friends. Reply to his friends. 

     Not one minute went by where his phone wasn‚Äôt in his hand. Mind you everyone else was living in the moment and just hanging out. I felt embarrassed to be around everyone when my boyfriend had his face in a screen like a toddler. I understand if he was checking important things. But no.. it was a scroll through reddit every 5 minutes,  it was sitting there refreshing his emails while we are all out to breakfast. 

     I finally got fed up and when we were in the hotel alone. I told him how upset I was and I told him I have felt alone this entire trip. I told him he was acting as if he was trying to close himself off from everyone by having his face in his phone. I asked him if he cared to get off his phone and be with me or was he just going to continue the behavior? 

     He told me with a serious face. ‚ÄúI have my phone for my ADHD.. I am not going to stop and I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù I told him I would just give up. I‚Äôm am just tired of trying to get through to him. I am at a loss here. I have never been in a relationship where I had to fight for attention over a screen. This is a different kind of pain. I just need advice on what actions I can take. 
     I don‚Äôt want to just give up. I want him to actually be with me. In person and understand that he has someone right here in front of him. I just don‚Äôt know the words or the actions to get through to him. Please anything will help.",dating_advice

We'd occasionally brush against each other's arms, hands and foots when we are studying, and when we walk together our hands and arms would brush against each others 80% of the time. She even threw signs at me last week that she was interested (I.E invited me to play a sport with her, asking me what there is to do around the area and then later mentioning she asked me that because she wanted to know if we could do hang out and do something over a weekend). 

So yeah, last weekend we couldn't meet up, no problem, but today I asked her if she wanted to go hang out this Sat and go kayaking. She sounded happy, but said she might be busy this Sat. and doesn't know yet.

t3_dlbw5f,An Odd Spot,"I'm just letting this play out. I'm in no rush, as curious as this situation makes me, but in short: I'm in an awkward spot between the metaphorical ""friend zone"" or maybe he's taking me more seriously. I have no idea which one.

We met, and it was great. Fireworks, chemistry, all the good stuff. We don't live close together but we keep in touch. He would text me everyday, and most convo got sexual quickly tbh, not that I minded. We set up for a weekend together and had a great time. Cool. He doesn't text everyday, but when we talk these days, it's deeper content. Like existential shit and our shared interests. He's really mentally present in these conversations, and I feel that difference. Not a single sexual thing since we shook it up all weekend (over a week ago now).

When we talked about how we felt 3ish years ago, we both were going through some rough patches in our personal lives. She was dealing with an overwhelming amount of family issues and I was going through anger management. These issues eventually collided with our desire to be together and we vented and yelled at each other. 

We have since apologized and worked on ourselves. I am very confident in the progress I have made and am excited to show off this better version of me. I have also seen her make much progress on herself and am very proud of her. I asked her to a movie and dinner coming up soon. I described it as ""let's talk one on one,"" ""getting things off my chest,"" and ""I'd like to pick your brain about some stuff."" She was very enthusiastic about this and seems excited to meet up. 

I, however, remain anxious. I feel like I may have presented myself as just a friend hanging out instead of treating it like a date. I attempted a quick little ""Its a date!"" No response to this comment. 

I guess my question/concern is this: Did I mess up/not do good enough job by not making it clear right off the top that I meant a date? Is there an appropriate way to confirm it is indeed a date, or should I wait it out. We are going out in 2 days, so really I will know in that time. I'm just anxious.

t3_dl3e58,Matching Energy,"I became newly single for the first time in my late 20's.  The strategy I used when looking for the next right person finally worked but it did take almost three years.  I have never had any interest in online dating, I want all my interactions to be face to face.  I started to frequent local bars, especially on karaoke nights.  At first I was just a passive observer, I watched closely how men and women behave when looking for a mate.  I noticed almost immediately that when a pretty girl gives any guy attention they automatically believe they have an actual chance.  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  I've seen time and time again a large group of men all fighting for the same girl and she gets her pick of the litter.  Once a girl makes her choice, all the rejected guys start acting like assholes.  Taking shit about her to cover their own insecurities.
By the time I was ready to put myself out there again I had seen this situation play out many times.  I decided to just reciprocate whatever approach was given to me.  If someone is being friendly, just be friendly back.  Maybe she just wants someone to talk to.  If she makes a complement about my appearance, talk about how nice she looks.  If she makes extended eye contact, go talk to her.  Offer to buy her a drink, if she accepts then sit with her and small talk.  If a conversation gets overly personal, be a little reserved but don't shut yourself down.  Don't give more than you are comfortable with.  
While doing this for a couple years I've met some great people but none of them were really right for me.  Either I wasn't attracted, or more commonly there was a personality conflict.  I started to realize I would never find the one for me at a bar.  I'm definitely opposed to the idea of a one night stand and I'm not looking for casual sex.
I made the decision not to chase girls.  I wanted one outgoing enough to initiate.  While waiting patiently for the right one I started to just match energy.  This strategy worked really well for me.  Casual flirtation with every single girl that sits close or starts a conversation.  After a while I decided to wait twice before summoning the courage to make a move.  If a girl initiates twice, then the third time I ask her out.  I still think it's best to keep things simple and not be aggressive about the date.  I look at it an opportunity to get to know them better instead of an opportunity to get laid.  It took some time but I finally found the right one for me.  When everything clicks the right way you will know for sure very quickly.

t3_dlb9i4,I froze twise while aprroching a girl on Ecstasy.,"(Long Post)
(Need help)

This happened yesterday, their was a fest going on in our University and since it was my last fest, i decided to drop Ecstasy. Since our University is located in a rural area their are no proper bars or pubs to drink, so the students have started drinking in a garden which is 50 metres from our University. This was a three day fest and on day two i went out drinking in this garden. I was drinking with my buddies (all guys) and after some time a group of girls from our University came and started drinking besides us. While drinking i noticed that two girls from that group are checking me out. 

Something about myself:- 

I am a 21(M) year old law student in the last year of his course. I have major social anxiety and in my five years at Uni, i have only socialized with a small group of people in my four years in Uni and almost all of them were guys. This was primarily because i got a cultural shock when i moved from a small town to one of the elitist University in India. I am 6ft 2inch with good facial features but a skinny frame. Generally people rate me 7/10. 

I was decently confident when i started University, but due to my inability to speak fluent English (which is the primary language of conversation in this place) and the highly urban crowd which i had never experienced before, my self confidence was very badly damaged. On top of that i made friends with people who had the same problem of language and culture like me, people who didn't exactly 'fit' in this place. 

Irrespective, they were pretty toxic and always discouraged and scrutinized any attempts that I made to socialize with people out of our social circle. They would make fun of me for misspranousning  words in my presentation and not able to form a coherent sentence when participating in class or speaking to other students. This led to me becoming more and more anxious leading to a total stop  by me to try anything or interacting with new people. 

I just started keeping quiet in lectures and just didn't interact with anyone in the class and made my body language very unnapprochable. This led me getting isolated, loosing my self worth and growing more and more insecure about myself everyday. I started suppressing my opinions and started doing everything which was acceptable by my isolated group of friends. I turned to weed and used to numb myself with it to coupe with the anxiety but the paranoia kept making it worse. 

I finally started fighting back from my third year and started working on myself. I started getting better at speaking English, learned a lot of new things, got better at studies and putting my opinion forward. I started being more assertive about my boundaries and stopped my friends from walking all over me all the time. But still there is a lot of anxiety, insecurity and an overall inferiority complex.

 I have only dated one girl in my life which was long distance, we met twice in 3 months and just made out. I don't consider this a proper relationship though. I have a decent amount of good female friends. But it is very difficult for me to talk to a unknown girl, and usually make a fool of myself. I get a decent amount of female attention and a lot of girls have tried to flirt with me but i just get too anxious and awkward. I start overthinking the interaction and always find a way to convince myself that this one isn't right for maybe the next one. However, now i have changed myself and i am trying to actively communicate with girls. I even approached two girls in the gap of six months and got rejected both the times due to very awkward conversation both the times. I have been feeling very lonely for the past 3 years and i crave romantic intimacy.

Coming back to story:-
After realising that both of them have been glancing towards me, i started making eye contact with the one(21)(F) I was interested in. However, like always i didn't approach her and just left the place after finishing the booze and even give a look back. The next day( last day of the fest) i popped ecstasy and went to the  garden with my friends, i started tripping intensely after i reached the party garden. Coincidentally, the same group of girls from day two came and started drinking 20 meters away from us. At this time i had reached my 'peak' of ecstasy and was tripping major nutsack. The high started reducing and got a collected my self a little bit but i was still pretty high, now i start noticing that the same girl from yesterday was again galncing at me in very short intervals, i started making eye contact with her but would break it in 2-3 seconds because of second thoughts. My friends started leaving for college but i was still pretty high so i decided to stay on my own, i started socialzing with people that i knew and all this while me and that girl kept making eye contact. I still wasn't sure weather i should go and talk to her. Then she looked at me for like 10 seconds without breaking eye contact and gave a huge smile. Because of the lowself esteem idiot that i am, i looked turned my neck in both the directions to confirm that she was actually smiling at me. Any other day I would have bounced from that place without approaching her because of my fear of rejection and making a fool out myself but not this time. This time i was on Ecstasy and wasn't feeling my high level of anxiety which generally happens in these kind of situation. I decided I am going to make to make a move this time. I had promised myself in the summer that I'll try and break my virginity in my last year of law school. I waited for an appropriate moment in which she wasn't occupied too much by her friends. I saw an opening and started walking towards her, she was making her drink from the bottle which was on the ground. I stopped 3 ft away from she turned saw me and smiled like she was expecting me. She turned her head again and i just froze. I couldn't utter a word, and after standing there for like 5 seconds without saying anything. I just walked of from their. I cursed by my self for being so pathetic and thought about going back in the college. But i decided to calm myself and try once again because i was really interested in this girl. I smoke a cigarette, muster all the courage and started walking towards her again, this time she was standing with her friend who were both dancing on rap. I stopped she saw me then started looking at her friend. I am feeling extremely nervous right now but i fight it and after 3 seconds i say "" I am sorry for earlier, i just got nervous"" in a very shaky voice. She responded ""it's okay you don't have to worry about that"" in a very soft tone. I ask her name tell her mine then shook her hand. Another friend of her came thinking that i was making her friend uncomfortable. Her friend who came, starts looking at me in a very suspicious way because it could be interpreted by my face that i was on some hard Drugs ( which i think the girl who i approached also figured out) my anxiety shoot up the roof and i wasn't able to utter even an alphabet. I froze again and walked of again, this time for real. I had a very bad trip after this incident and kept cursing myself for being a losser.

I seriously need help as to how to overcome my social anxiety and be self- confident, that why i gave a detailed description of myself.

t3_dlb30q,Is he really nice or being flirty? [18F/19M],"My ex broke up with me a month ago and after a few weeks, we decided to remain as friends. At first it was a bit awkward but we got comfortable and eventually he decided to visit me (we live about 3 hours away from each other). 

We had a fun time and shared some laughs and jokes. He said he was nervous to visit because he thought he would be quiet and awkward but instead he was almost the same as when we were dating, without the romance of course. 

The day after his visit, his texts were very short and I pointed out that he was acting weird but he claimed he wasn't so I let that go. Today, his behavior has been so different. He called me adorable after having a playful argument over text about me being scary and tough, which I'm not but I was joking that I could be to which he replied with a simple ""adorable"" and two laughing emojis. 

Later in the day we were joking around and during that time he sent me two smirking emojis. I'm not really sure how to react to this, I just keep brushing it off as though it's nothing but really I'm confused. The only times he's been like this is when we were dating, even before dating he never acted this way.

We've texted every day, sometimes hours on end. Due to conflicting responsibilities we've been on just one date. It went very, very well, we had a blast and talked for hours. We have our second date set up for this weekend.

We both feel a very strong connection with each other. During our conversations we've talked about a lot of deep topics and asked somewhat hard questions of each other, as we both felt it was better to see what red flags popped up so we knew what the score was and not waste each other's time. It turns out there are none. A few concerns on each side, but nothing close to a deal breaker. We think a lot alike on most topics.

I'm not a very experienced dater, in fact this will be only the 3rd person I've ever dated. It seems based on what I've seen around that it's very uncommon to have a very strong connection with someone after just 2 weeks of knowing somebody. Do I need to be worried about anything?",dating_advice
t3_dl821u,break up advice??,"i have found myself in a bit of a predicament. so me (17) and this guy (17) have been good friends since middle school. he‚Äôs told me he had a crush on me for a very long time, but i never reciprocated those feelings. he‚Äôs had a couple girlfriends in high school, and i felt jealous for some reason but i never knew why. this year (last year of high school) we have really gotten close again and i thought i was getting a crush on him. we went on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù saturday and he officially asked me out. i thought i was excited about it, but all day sunday i was having really bad anxiety about it and regretting my decision to say yes. i talked to my mom about it but she said i was putting too much pressure on it and that i just needed to calm down and take control of the situation. today is monday and everything went okay with the boy today. i am not sure if we have labels on our relationship, but he did put the date in his insta bio...

i really just don‚Äôt know how to feel about the situation. i feel like nothing really change, but the energy between us shifted and all im feeling is anxiety. i feel like i made a bad decision and am going to end up breaking his heart because he‚Äôs wanted this for so long and i am already thinking about ending whatever this is. i don‚Äôt think im ready for a boyfriend, not to mention im moving 5 hours away for college next fall and he‚Äôs staying here. 

i know im being rash about this but i feel it‚Äôs the only way to calm my anxiety. we do have a lunch date coming up in a few days so maybe i should wait to do anything until then. i would really appreciate any advice you guys could give me. thanks :)

tl;dr ‚Äî girl and boy were friends for years. boy had crush on girl but girl never felt the same. boy and girl start senior year of high school and girl thinks she has a crush on boy, but when boy asks her out and girl says yes, girl starts to regret the decision and starts to panic. girl needs advice please.",dating_advice

t3_dlaytb,Ex wants to come back?,"So I had a short relationship in the beginning of the year and things didn‚Äôt work out. We remained friends for a bit but then I realized I was only staying friends to get back together, so I told her if she was ever interested in a relationship again to reach out. The summer goes by and I find out we have the same first period together. Weeks go by and she gives me a ton of little hints but we hadn‚Äôt talked.

Eventually through a mutual friend she said she wanted to talk more and ‚Äúget to know me again.‚Äù We talked for a bit and after a few weeks I asked her out but she avoided the question, I asked what her plans for us talking were and she said she didn‚Äôt have any for us and it was good with basic snap chats. I said it was best if we didn‚Äôt talk then because I did say before that we should only talk if she was interested in a relationship, she agreed.

Two weeks go by and her birthday comes up, I decide to be a nice guy and wish her a happy birthday, after all she did for me when we weren‚Äôt talking. But after I told her happy birthday, she said thanks, and I said no problem. But then she kept roping me back into conversation, whether us was about work or assignments due in our shared class. 

Big part: We talked about work for a day and it just ended up back with us talking again. I was confused why she would keep roping me back into conversation when I explicitly said we shouldn‚Äôt talk unless she‚Äôs interested, there‚Äôs no way she forgot. 

Sometimes we talk a lot but sometimes it‚Äôs hours between responses on both ends. Recently we had a very long convo over snap videos, which seemed pretty personal, even when we were dating we never really did videos.

t3_dl7t8t,Girl ghosted me after 2 and a half months,"How in the world does somebody who claimed to care about you do this?? (This might be a long one but please read and help me understand this cause I‚Äôm having a hard time here)

This girl and I met about mid July and hit it off right away, she explained how she just got out of a 4 year toxic relationship a couple months back, so I was hesitant to even pursue anything with her to begin with. But the chemistry was so strong I went for it anyway.

All of August we hung out and got pretty close, she slept at my place all the time and this might be TMI but the sex was fantastic (had sex multiple times a night/morning and the sexual chemistry was off the charts) as well as natural chemistry between us. We spoke about the future and what we wanted as far as in our relationship and overall life. And it was her that would bring these things up implying she saw a future with me. 

She would always say how well I treated her and that she finally knows how it feels to be in a healthy relationship compared to her ex. I would pay for most things as a man should in a relationship and she said she hated it cause she wasn‚Äôt used to it. She even met my family and her relationship with them was great, they loved her. 

I even surprised her with NFL tickets to an upcoming game she had been hinting at wanting to go to (just happened to be my favorite team vs her favorite team). She was so excited and kept saying how she never saw it coming and has never been surprised like that before. We had the best time ever at the game and the chemistry between us just got stronger and stronger. She even admitted ‚Äúshe hate how much she really really liked me‚Äù. 

The following week we hung out again as usual and I went out with my boys Friday night and had a guys night. On Saturday she came over and we hung out all day and she was going out and having a girls night that night, she got ready at my place and then went out, I picked her up from downtown at 2am, got food went home and had sex like usual. 

The next morning something seemed off. No morning sex and I was the one inducing the cuddling and touching where she usually does. She went home after cause she said she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. She did end up being sick that week and kept saying how she felt like shit. We were texting like usual throughout the week but something seemed different. She wasn‚Äôt really engaging much and seemed short and colder (she would usually send paragraphs, double text and send lots of emojis). I felt like I was bugging her so I never replied for a day. 

She texted me the next day after I never replied and said ‚Äúhi‚Äù. I texted her back like nothing was wrong and we were texting like normal again. Few days later she never responded back to me like I did to her. So I texted her ‚Äúhey‚Äù the next day and again, started texting like normal. Few days later she again, never responded. Couple days go by and then she texts me a long paragraph how she ‚Äúthought she was ready for something again but she doesn‚Äôt think she is anymore‚Äù and that it has nothing to do with me, she‚Äôs just been in a really bad funk. I texted her back and said I totally understand and completely get it. Said how I would like to have one last conversation with her about things and send each other on our way.

She said how she would like that and seemed excited and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk Monday night! We can even have a few drinks too‚Äù and kept saying to make sure I text her Sunday to set up a time for Monday. 

Sunday rolls around and I text her and ask if she‚Äôs still down to talk on Monday, got nothing in return. Monday comes and I text her around noon and said ‚Äúhey‚Äù, again got nothing. After a couple days I decide to send her one last text and basically said how all I wanted was to talk one last time and end on a positive note rather than ignoring each other. Said how I thought we had more respect for one another than that considering all the good times we shared, and then told her to take care of herself. And that was it, as expected no reply to that as well. 

After her not responding to anything it was the worst couple weeks ever mentally. Made me think something was wrong with me and made me feel very unwanted and left me feeling like shit. Made me think the whole thing was a lie and she never cared at all which stung like hell cause I actually really cared about her. It was so confusing because it was one of those relationships that even thought we only knew each other for a couple months,  the chemistry was so strong it felt like we knew each other our whole lives.  

And to just leave me hanging like that after she seemed excited to talk one last time hurt on another level, would of never done that to her. Wouldn‚Äôt wish this feeling on anyone. And now here I am confused and can honestly say I don‚Äôt know if I can ever fully believe anything a woman says to me going forward, and it‚Äôs gonna be tough to ever become vulnerable and open myself up to anyone again.

Also, I‚Äôm 25 and she‚Äôs 22.

And for some extra info: not to brag or anything but I don‚Äôt lack experience at all, I‚Äôm an attractive dude, played D1 soccer and in the gym 5 days a week. I‚Äôve had relationships before and throughout the years have had many hookups, most of them from dating apps like tinder.

Even though these types of things aren‚Äôt hugely dramatic, what do you guys think about it? Is it a deal breaker if the person that shows up from tinder is 20 lbs heavier or looks 2 years older?

t3_dl7m7g,How to get over the Manic Pixie Dream Girl idea?,"If you don't know what an MPDG is, chances are you've at least seen it in the dating world. Guy meets girl, guy falls in love with girl, girl doesn't reciprocate feelings, guy is crushed. It's commonly described as ""putting women on a pedestal."" 

It's seeing dating as a means of therapy, hoping that finding that one perfect girl will ""save"" them, give them a purpose in life, and make them a better man. (Women go through this too, but men are notorious for it.) 

500 Days of Summer depicts this process perfectly (https://youtu.be/DOrfYQPZF6k). While I haven't seen the whole movie yet, the character of Tom blew my mind. I realized I'm (almost) exactly like him. 

I'll meet a girl, we'll have a good conversation, maybe even do something fun together like have a meal or dance for a while. I'll ask for her number or social media, and usually she says yes and gives it to me. Then, usually, one of two things will happen:

1. I find out she has a boyfriend, usually through social media. 
2. She'll never answer my text, or give me the classic ""I'll think about it,"" which we all know means ""letting them down easy."" 

Then comes the ""I hate Summer"" phase. I cringed as I wrote that, but the first step in overcoming a problem, is admitting you have a problem in the first place. Anxiety kicks in, and then anger. Towards her, then myself. I'll get angry at her for rejecting my advances, then get mad at myself for thinking that way. I'll imagine what could've been, then slap myself for hoping for something that will never happen. I'll enter the mindset of, ""Whatever, her loss, I'm a great guy,"" then start asking myself, ""How? Look at yourself. What girl would want you?"" 

Maybe I do need therapy, or maybe I just need to grow up. I don't know where to go from here. But again, the first step in overcoming a problem, is admitting you have a problem in the first place. 

Hopefully we can get some good discussion going, and hopefully others can learn from this thread :) Have a good one, y'all.",dating_advice
t3_dl7ike,Reluctant about formally asking someone out,"I couldn't think of a better title, sorry. I am 17M and the girl in question is 19F with a year and a month or two age gap. I will refer to her as ""Ashley."" Throwaway account for obvious reasons. My mind is also kind of scattered right now because I don't know what to do.

The timeframe is also kind of a blur except for a few days because I wasn't really paying attention.

From the start, me having a typical high school crush on her seemed wrong, because I met her at work awhile ago when she first started at our location. I always have known that workplace relationships can lead to negative consequences, and I am just starting to get some steam going at my local fast food store (they're training me for IT work)

Ashley has always been outgoing, which was also kind of threw me off because I couldn't tell if she actually liked me or was just being nice like she always was. Either way, we exchanged info and have been talking outside work for awhile now. She's actually starting to really open up to me when it comes to some of the issues she's been dealing with lately, which is why now I am questioning my morals on whether or not to formally ask her out.

If I had to put a timeframe on stuff, I would say we met in late September and started talking outside work around the first week or so of October.

So, shortly after we start talking, I invite her to my apartment (really my dad's, but he works nights so it's usually free right after school until like midnight) to binge some episodes of a TV show we're both interested in. She said she'd love to, but she has her college midterms coming up. So I suggested a week after (Mon, Oct 14) and she said sure.

She flaked about an hour before she said she'd come over because she was sick. She seemed very apologetic about it, so I more or less shrugged it off. We then talked throughout that week, which is when she really started opening up with me in regards to her darker side. So fast forward to like Thursday/Friday (Oct. 17-18) and she drops a huge batch of truth which I promised not so share (regarding her past and stuff.) She was in a pretty shitty mood, so I told her that I personally as well as some of our coworkers care about her well being, which she was thankful to hear.

Fast forward yet again to yesterday (Sun, Oct 20) and she asked for some help with an assignment for her Web Development class. I offer to have her over to my apartment again (I know it was short notice, and was expecting her to say no) and she said she was feeling pretty sick. She also said she was asked to come into work for a couple hours. I figured she wouldn't because she said she was sick, but she did. I checked in with her after her short shift, and she said it was fine.

So overnight, I texted her and said something along the lines of ""I understand if this seems overly pushy, but would you rather cancel us hanging out sometime or would you like to pick a day"" and earlier today she got back to me saying she has been holding of with hanging out in general (including her own friends) because of some issues she's been dealing with.

I mean, I understand that last part because my last major ex had some similar things going on. One of the key differences though is that my previous ex was the one to admit her feelings to me, but this time I would like to admit my feelings to her.

TL;DR we met at our workplace and seemed to hit it off pretty well, but she hasn't been wanting to hang out with many people at all because of personal issues.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that being said, we have been able to reliably make small talk along the lines of ""how was your day"" with somewhat frequent long and involved (sometimes personal) conversations, too. I guess I am just too inexperienced with dating to tell if this is going anywhere or not, so any advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_dl7a9z,Dating a teammate and coworker (close proximity),"Hey reddit. 

Need some advice here.

I (24M) got put on a new team at work about 6 months back, and got a new industry hire (27F) also put on my team. We work in very close proximity, everyday meetings, projects, discussions, literally has a desk very close to mine. I am more senior than her in the company but not her manager or even a manager so this is totally fine company wise.

Honestly I‚Äôve always found her attractive even before she was on my team, but recently I‚Äôve had a somewhat revelation that I‚Äôd rather date people I get on with personally than people I just solely think are super hot (shocking revelation but it took time).

She‚Äôs always been very friendly to me and we do a bunch of stuff inside work together, same sports teams, same parties, moral events etc. But it‚Äôs mainly been all work related.

Anyway, a few weeks back at a work party she and I got talking and we both sort of hit it off and discussion got kind of deep, we‚Äôre both strangers in this country. Long story short I messaged her afterwards and got her number incase she ever ‚Äúneeded someone‚Äù, she did the same and it was quite cute.

Since then I‚Äôve been trying to look for a good way to transition this, I‚Äôve been inviting her to events with friends and picking her up / arriving together / leaving together at those events, walk her home etc. The other day I invited her out after work and we grabbed some dinner after work and just talked for a few hours. She also sometimes leaves me nice gifts in the office.

Despite all this I‚Äôm finding it really hard to actually tell her intentions here, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs in the same boat when it comes to the issue of being super close team wise but honestly I think I can make it work. 

But it‚Äôs also possible I‚Äôm being super naive and she‚Äôs treating all this stuff as friends. We‚Äôre not massively flirtatious together either, but this could be because we don‚Äôt know where we stand with each other. It could be quite weird if I‚Äôm taking it one way and she‚Äôs taking it another considering how close proximity we work.

We don‚Äôt really message much outside of work, I know this is something I need to work on but she‚Äôs not a fantastic replier, id say introverted for sure, she‚Äôs this way with almost everyone.

What‚Äôs your thoughts reddit, do I keep going here, am I naive and she just wants friendship? 

How do I transition this to a more dating vibe without it being weird but at the same time being clear we‚Äôre at least thinking of being more than friends?

He broke up with me and we broke up on good terms in the sense that we still love each other but that he just doesn‚Äôt have the emotional capacity to have me in his life atm, but I however was on the other side, so this break up really devastated me. 

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since we broke up and things seem to be going okay for him. I, however am not coping. My emotions consume me everyday and when we had a little chat to discuss if it was really over while giving our stuff back, he told me he didn‚Äôt know if he made a bad mistake. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to leave me on the hook when this is precisely what he did- I gave myself false hope, only to find out 2 days later WHEN I CALLED that he was back at square one (set on breaking up completely) . 

He says it‚Äôs been hard for him but everything seems so easy for him. I accidentally saw him at a party and he treated me so friendly like everything was fine, and I had to leave early because I couldn‚Äôt deal with seeing him so early after the break up in a social setting - it was awful...  he‚Äôs told me it‚Äôs difficult for him but he‚Äôs just good at hiding his emotions and he doesn‚Äôt let them consume him.

(I later learned that her husband is in prison, doesn't have custody of any of her children, and possibly does drugs. Her husband gets out of prison Nov. 20th)


I reached out to his mom to see if she knew anything. She didn't know about the mood stabilizers, but did shed some light on my speculation of the two of them being together. A little over a week ago his Sister-in-law reached out to me to inform me that the ""best friend"" had been living there for almost 3 months, that she and her husband (his brother) had heard them having sex multiple times, and that my ex had indeed started using drugs. The SIL said she told the ex to move out by the time she got home on a certain day, and when she got home - both of them were gone. And that she was most likely the source for the drug use. He became a different person over the last few months, his family had noticed as well. 

Before I learned that last bit of information I had texted him asking what I was to him at that point. Two days went by without any word from him, and he finally texted claiming his phone hadn't been sending messages. So fed up, I asked why he was texting me, and that I knew about everything. Sent a lengthy text about everything I knew and about how he hurt me. 

I never got a response after that. 


I want to believe that if he gets clean, and that his ex is removed from the picture that we could be together again. We get along great, have similar humor/taste, and a lot in common. I just can't believe how quickly the flip was switched once she entered the picture. So am I crazy that I would want to eventually forgive him?",dating_advice
t3_dl0io4,From fiery to cryogenic in 7 days: Advise needed.,"Hi all,

First post on here, sometime lurker. I was hoping to get your advise on a somewhat puzzling situation I've found myself with a date:

So, a few weeks ago this girl contacts me on OKCupid. We've got very similar backgrounds, same age (37), same education (Phds), similar interests, values, etc and overall just click like mad. In short, the 99% match that OKC claimed we had seems to be about right, the only significant differences being that she went through a nasty divorce a few years back, and that she has a 5 yo kid with the scum sucker she divorced. I was very up-front about me genuinely being OK with her having a kid, though.

We message back and forth for a week, and we get to know each other really well (too well?), being open and honest about everything and just discussing anything that comes into mind. Then, after about a week, we go on our first date. It goes (in my mind) quite well, and at the end of the night she invites me up to her place, and after some awkwardness we end up in bed.

Day after, she is in emotional turmoil, and says she feels it was a step too fast, too far. Her main issue seems to have been that she'd never experienced someone being as open, emotionally available, caring, and accepting ever. Though I'm not entirely clear on why that would be a problem, I remain open and accepting (truthfully), and we agree to take things a bit slower.

Of course, that doesn't really happen, and two days later we have date two, ending up in bed at my place, for one of the more amazing nights I've ever had. Everything seemed to indicate that she shared my enthusiasm. Note, this must have been premeditated by her, since she brought all her stuff to sleep over.

Now, in the aftermath of this, there doesn't seem to be the same turmoil, and we end up having another insane night together a few days after. During this, we mutually admit (albeit on my initiative) that we're falling in love with each other. This is followed by a general escalation of the messaging back and forth, with increasingly intimate and sexual themes being played out. We can't follow the same 2 day rhythm of getting together since she was going on a hiking trip with family, during the course of she seems to have spoken about me and included me in plans for future get-togethers. This is important since she's incredibly close with her family.

She comes to me rather than going home after her little trip, sending me pictures and in general continuing with the sexy talk until shortly before arriving. Now, this date goes a bit awry, with me managing to screw up by making far too spicy food etc., and somehow not being particularly energetic in bed. So, instead of sleeping over, she gets up at midnight and goes to her place. Next morning, I get a message that her emotions are again messed up, and that despite liking me and the physical aspect of things working awesomely, she's been ""desperately waiting"" for the ""butterflies"" and they're not coming. So she calls quits to the entire thing, and immediately goes on OKC again.

I try to act pretty aloof and OK with this (despite, obviously, being head-over-heels), and not responding to a few one-liners she sends me over the course of the next days until a few days later. When I finally do respond, she seems to be taken aback by my acting normal, having decided that my silence meant that I was no longer talking to her. Then, when I suggest we meet up and chat, she states that we should ""let the grass grow over"" before meeting. This seems a bit counter-intuitive, given that she called it quits precisely because she didn't have feelings? And this leads us to now, where we're at a stand-off, me having said that I'll leave the ball on her side of the court.

Now, I suppose I'm to blame for this by not being more restrained during the start-up of this thing, but it's difficult to keep back when you find someone you click so utterly with, and I'm a bit baffled by the entire thing. There were a few issues, though: One is that I wasn't taking good enough care of myself, and that I wasn't confident enough, though both seem to be premature statements. Second, she kept talking about her ex and comparing me to him, though favourably.

So, what do you guys think? Is there any point in hoping on this somehow might work out and she'll come around? Or should I just cut my losses and forge on? And if I were to pursue, what would be a meaningful strategy? Currently, I'm simply in holding pattern with NC, as I can't really think of anything particularly impactful to say.

Any insights or tips would be greatly appreciated!",dating_advice
t3_dl62me,Asking someone out over messaging,"So I've (19M) met this girl (19) at Uni and we really get along. I've wanted to ask her our for a while now but the only time I tend to see her in person is in a group setting and I feel like asking her out in that context would probably be awkward and inappropriate.

t3_dl61nz,Was I just a rebound?,"So a few weeks ago, I went out with a couple of friends for a quiet night out at a bar. Some of them guys and some of them girls. When we arrive at the bar we go to drop off our coats and jacket. I just so happen to be alone with one of the girls from our company. I take her jacket and as we're about to leave the wardrobe, I notice she is a bit besides herself, so I ask her, just to be nice. ""Hey, are you alright?"" She tears up a bit and tells me about a guy who is also at the bar with his new girlfriend and it's making her a bit upset. I hug her and tell her it's okay to be sad about these things, lets have a nice night and don't feel obligated to stay at the bar if you're not feeling like it.

Fast-forward that evening, we're leaving. As we walk home me and the girl end up holding hands. She walks close to me almost shoulder against shoulder and being the drunk guy I am, I just play along. I do the whole rubbing her hand with my thumb and we just walk home with some of our other friends.

Next week! We go out, have a nice time again all of my friends and I together. Night seems very calm. I'm sitting next to the same girl again, when she puts a hand to my knee. I respond to it and place my hand on her hand and then shifts it to her leg. We end up walking home again with a couple of friends. Me and her hand in hand. We end up at her place which is also the place of one of the other guys of the group. We sit down in the couch, me, her and my friend. She leans over to me and rests her head on my shoulder.

20 minutes later my friend asks me if I want to go smoke a bit. I say sure and walk with him outside. I take one drag and I tell him heading back inside. Now i'm in the couch alone with girl. I sit in one end of the couch and her in the other. I'm wondering wether I should make a move, but can't make myself do it. Then she moves from the other end of the couch down to me and leans up against me again. I think, fuck it. I start giving her signals. It pays off. I put my hand on her cheek and she turns and we start kissing.

Next week! Again! We're back out, but this i'm not getting any signals from her and nothing intimate is happening. This time we have a lot more friends with us, so I start to wonder if she's shy because we have a lot more people with us. Anyway, the night ends. Nothing happens whatsoever. I go to bed and now curiosity is killing me. Did she initiate all this intimacy, just to use me as a rebound. Or is there something for me to follow up on in the future. I haven't texted her at all and am doubting wether or not I should. I part of me just really wants to know where i'm standing with this girl.

Sorry if my english is poor, but it's a 2nd language.

t3_dl93du,Does dating ever get easier?,"Does it ever get easier? I'm a 19 year old guy who's had one near half year relationship, and a couple hook ups with one girl, that sums up the majority of my dating experience. I've obviously had many more first dates but not much beyond that, but I've only really been dating for about two years. I find myself frequently frustrated with dating, as I'm sure is common. I don't think I'm unattractive, I workout frequently, I have a nice career as a personal trainer lined up, I am learning guitar, and I'm very interested in many things, have many hobbies, have a few friends. I think I'm doing pretty good. But, still, I am very unsatisfied with the state of my love life. I don't have a relationship, nor have I ever had, the relationship I want. I don't go on dates too often because the only place I go to meet girls is dating apps, I don't go to school so I don't meet them there and if I ever do meet a girl in public I don't have the skills or understanding of how to bring the conversation to flirting or it's usually when I'm working and don't want to break professionalism. If I could just get a girl to give me a chance I think I make a great partner when I get comfortable but before that I struggle. My question is, does it ever get any easier? With age? With time? With experience? With location? With lifestyle? With anything. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading",dating_advice
t3_dl92h5,Why do I have to be me?,"Jesus, I'm just tired of life. I've completely abandoned the thought of having a significant other at this point. I'm 17M, and I know people will say I'm still young, but who I am will stick. I got so unlucky and ended up having red hair. Not bright orange, mind you, which I suppose is better for me. I have a smile so ugly only a mother could love it, maybe not even that. I know a lot of people will say ""hey, red hair is attractive. I really like it"" well, unfortunately, that has never been the case in my life, just the opposite. I used to be the ultimate nice guy, but knowing it got me nowhere in trying to find a girlfriend I took all the steps to stop it, and - I did. I went too far the other way. I don't feel like I have a loveable personality, I can't find a middle ground between being kind but not being a nice guy. I'm always too mean and can never rack up the courage to ask a girl out because the thought of someone wanting to be in a relationship with me is so alien that I'm worried some covert extraterrestrial research organisation will kick my front door down and arrest me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've put up the front of 'fake it til you make it' for 8 months, but there's no making it for me. Everything, and I mean **everything** about me I am insecure about: face, hair, eyes, nose, teeth, smile(at least this one is reasonable, I know it's god awful. Who wants a boyfriend who always looks miserable because he can't smile?), voice, body, skin tone, personality. I can't think of one positive about myself - seriously. It's not even like I've got one good thing going for me, it's almost impossible. I don't have a loveable personality where I can still act masculine, I don't have looks going for me, Jesus what on earth did I do in my past life?

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and incase things weren't bad enough my family relationship is reduced to crumbs. I live with an abusive parent and being able to have a good relationship with her is so far out of the question that having a normal mother-son bond is impossible. Bringing a girl home, let along introducing her to my family, would be a catastrophe. I know I'm not supposed to say that because they're still family, but I can't put up a lie any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yeah, that's me. If you thought your life was bad, I hope this post can help you realise that - despite whatever you may think is bad about yourself - you're still not me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was more of a rant, I guess. I needed to get this off my chest. I just hate myself, and I have to keep it bottled up because it shows lack of confidence which, in turn, is unattractive and affects how people see you. If anyone could please spare any advice they have to make me feel just a little better and not on the verge of tears daily, I would be really appreciative. Thank you",dating_advice

We all started hanging out together in late 2016. I initially had a crush on Girl 1 (now 24F), so I asked her out. She had a boyfriend at the time that I didn't know about and said no, but we've grown to be close friends since. I honestly can't fathom how I ever saw her in that way.

A few months later, in March 2017, I asked out her younger sister, Girl 2 (now 21F). She said she ""liked me too"" but wasn't ready for a relationship, so nothing ever came of it. We haven't even really brought it up since. We're definitely just friends.

Well, now--surprise, surprise--I've found myself crushing on Girl 3 (24F) who recently had a baby (she's not with the father). I actually crushed on her before anyone else several years back, but didn't ask her out because I thought she was out of my league, lol.

Bear in mind, this has all happened over the course of 3-4 years and a lot has happened in-between. We've all had relationships come and go and we were all there for each other throughout it all, and we've grown very, very close.

I'd say it's about 50/50 whether Girl 3 would give me a chance, but idk. It's been several months now, and I can't get this crush out of my head. Should I shoot my shot? Should I keep internalizing this attraction? I don't want to cause any problems within the group, but at the same time I hate keeping this to myself. It's driving me crazy.

TL;DR - I have a crush on a really close friend. I've asked out our other friends before, but nothing happened. I really like her but I don't want to cause any awkwardness or drama. **What do I do?**",dating_advice

t3_dl1b2f,"Experienced an amazing first date with someone I met off Hinge this past weekend, and made plans for this weekend, how do I make sure I‚Äôm able to keep my expectations in check?","It‚Äôs been exactly a year since my last real Hinge experience, and suffice to say that this past one I had on Saturday night ended up being pretty amazing. We talked for about a week leading up to it, and the amount of things we have in common is pretty unheard of. Even down to our ACT scores, and the two days of the week we go to the gym, our routines and mundane ways of like being a full time adult working in different roles in different school districts- sharing the same kinds of experiences and passion about our careers was very unique. I can usually tell with how a dates going in terms of interaction and conversation themes and we covered a ton that we agree on. What was suppose to be just a meet up to get food ended up at a bar there after getting a few drinks walking around a downtown town we both live close to it was great! So much so we ended up making plans for this upcoming weekend too. 

Now what I have some questions for anyone who can help is firstly, how do you still keep communication alive in between dates without it coming across as needy/clingy or overbearing? I know once plans are made for the next date, texting inbetween is probably not necessary, but just keeping the beat alive how could that be done?

Also this one is my main question, as I feel like it‚Äôs the one thing that always slowly kills my dates before they form into actual relationships. I get and understand in my head how relationships are ‚Äúsuppose‚Äù to work, I myself have never been in a long term relationship so I don‚Äôt have that experience going for me, but I understand the aspect of meeting the needs of each other, and respecting the delicate balance of space along with still being independent, but in terms of personality- this is something I lack, and it‚Äôs been the factor that probably hinders me the most. I can talk about my life and rehash information all day long, but as far as tradition hobbies are concerned I don‚Äôt have any to speak of. When I talk or think of ideas for conversations they tend to feel robotic in nature, not in the way that I would talk to my best friend and share funny memes with per say, I feel like I do this to uphold an image. There‚Äôs that element you just are under invisible pressure to not embarrass yourself, say something stupid or off putting, and always try and make your life sound interesting to the other person. Except my life, and actually believe it or not in the case of the girl I met this past weekend as well, we are both pretty mundane. About 70% of the time we talked about work, 10% family, 20% various other interests. Aside from that our lives are the same. We‚Äôre both introverts who work Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 days a week, and still live at home with our parents doing not much else besides Netflix and chores. Not really even hanging out with friends on the weekends at all. That‚Äôs probably why we vibe together in a way that just fits. But going off that, trying to get into a relationship as ‚Äúboring‚Äù people, how do I work on myself to find a personality? I feel like it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve lost growing up. It‚Äôs made me second guess myself in the sense that ‚ÄúWhat really makes me unique?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat makes me stand out?‚Äù Sense of humor is one thing, but even generally speaking that goes only so far. How do you turn someone who you want to date, and show off your personality to them as you would your best friend? Or if you struggle to identify a personality and you seem like a boring person, what can be done to work on that element? Any advice or experiences would be appreciated.",dating_advice
t3_dl6b56,How do I get over being afraid to show affection?,"I (24F) used to be a very affectionate person, both verbally and physically, in my teens. Every time I was interested in a guy and I would start showing them affection, they would reciprocate and I would think ""oh of course they're interested in me too."" But then I'd tell them how I feel and they would reject me. It happened several times. I admit that I might've been a little too much at points, but it still hurt a lot.

Over time, I withdrew and stopped feeling comfortable showing affection. Now, I'm casually dating a very affectionate guy (25M) and I find myself being scared to return that affection because I'm afraid I'll look *too* into him and he'll get bored of me or stop liking me. I know it's irrational, which is why I'm seeking advice, maybe from other people who have gone through this? It makes me feel so bad because he's always kissing me on the forehead and holding my hand and all that stuff, but I just feel so reluctant to reciprocate. How do I get over this fear?",dating_advice

t3_dl6aal,"Asking out your first crush years after school, when both are adults? Good idea? Anyone tried it? Should I?","We're both 24 now. Way back in school we won the poetry prize together with both our entries impressing whomever picked the winner, and we both wound up being appointed vice-house captain of our house in 5th year where we gave some speeches at assemblies together. I crushed hard on this girl in school, I thought she was  the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, and very few women have ever compared in my eyes, but I lacked the confidence to do anything but be embarrassed and secretive about how I felt (even though I made it abundantly clear with how much I stared at her in English class, turning around looking right back at her was hardly subtle with the frequency I would do it, and how I would be totally feckless when I was alone with her). Biggest regret of my life was failing to be bold in those moments. But at the time I was not outgoing or confident, and I knew all three of her exes over the years, many were my friends and I didn't want to make things weird admitting my feelings were the same as them as, while they dated her, I distanced myself from them all during those times. Couldn't stand to be around them like that. I walked home once with her and one of my friends while they dated. It was incredibly awkward, and even I knew at the time they weren't happy together, it was incredibly uncomfortable. The only friend I confided in at the time, told me they were unhappy together all throughout the time they dated, crying and arguing with one another, and when they broke up, they became much happier people. I won't deny this made me very happy, my friend encouraged me to make a move after that breakup happened, but I was shit scared to do anything and did nothing. 


What I want to know is how should I go about trying to reconnect with her and ask her for a date if she was open to such an idea? NOt only do I want to shoot my shot, but I also want to stop being tired and hung up on memories of the past, wishing I'd acted when I hadn't. We're both now single, she seems to be in a good place and open to dating someone new, but I don't really know her too well any more. Haven't spoken in years. Is it really as simple as asking her if she wants to meet up for coffee or a drink sometime out of the blue via facebook or something, or should I try running into her in person and arranging meeting up from there again? Or is this a bad idea at heart and I should just try burying this hatchet and accept I fucked it way back then in school, because I feel like there is still hope for me yet here. 

And yet I am so fucking afraid of doing anything, this is the original crush we've all experienced, the scary one I've never acted on, and I have a chance here to actually learn or gain something from the opportunity whatever the outcome. I need some advice here. My parents and siblings would want details to get advice (and I've never asked them for advice on this stuff anyway, I've never gotten the sense they understand this subject, or me, well anyway) and I'm not sure how helpful their advice would be. Couple of friends have said just to act on it anyway and see what happens, but I need further opinion.


But I also feel I have to make a move and do something or I'll regret never acting on my feelings even once with this girl, because it's followed me for years even though we've spent many apart, I still kept tabs, couldn't help it. 

I'm more than aware she could say no and I think I'd feel much lighter and free to move on with that answer, as many others I've seen in this sub have done the same. More than aware she could say yes and I'd be the happiest man on the planet for that moment. More than aware she could say yes, we date, and I realise this infatuation was a bit fantastical and we don't click or match well together as a couple. Again this is possible, but probably a good thing for moving forward and developing as a person. Or it could be the best decision I've ever made in my life if she does say yes and we click. I just don't know. And that's shit scary. Is it worth putting it on the line to find out? 

I asked out a coworker a short while ago, after asking advice here, and she said yes. I felt so empowered and unafraid afterwards, wondering why I felt so scared in the first place. Things didn't work out. But this girl feels different. I'm afraid she will say no, I'm afraid she will say yes and I was wrong. What do I do?",dating_advice

t3_dl68ar,Don‚Äôt call someone a bad title if they aren‚Äôt,"I‚Äôm 22 now and this happened when I was 19 so it‚Äôs been a while, but it still haunts me. I really liked this person who we will call Ashley. I would love to spend time and I picked up a trait of my grandfathers of being a giving person so I loved to give small things to Ashley. It usually was a candy bar or a soda or something similar. One day as I was typing out that I would really like to see her again after our third date, she said that I gave a stalker vibe and she didn‚Äôt want to see me. I was crushed to put it lightly so when I saw her the next day, I said nothing to her and ignored her. I later became a friend with her if only because of proximity. She explained that she just couldn‚Äôt figure out how to tell me she just wanted to be friends, so she went with the first option. I did not and will not condone those actions and to this day those words echo through my head if I appear at all strange wherever I may be. 

So in short: people always say that they do not want to be called bad things, so don‚Äôt say something if it isn‚Äôt true. If it will hurt the other persons feelings (exceptions do apply) just don‚Äôt say it.

t3_dl6091,I [16M] will go out (first time) with a girl [16F] to the theatre on the 8th of November (she kinda asked me out),"Some backstory:

There's a girl in my class who's always been very friendly with me and has talked with me quite often. Once she started to come over to my dorm and I made tea for her (I made her tea without milk and with honey [she didn't drink tea without milk and she didn't like honey]), anyways when I made her the tea and she drinked it she absolutely adored it and she told me that she loves my tea and that only I made her like honey. She started to visit me more often and once we were alone for half an hour and we had a wonderful convention. Then she found out that I like going to the theatre and she told me that she ""would love to go to the theatre with me"" and ""that she would definitely go with me to the theatre"". She asked me if I will go to the theatre and I told her that I had one play in mind where I would've like to go. Skip some days and on the last school day before fall break (last Friday) I asked her if she would like to go with me to the theatre after school - she agreed and wrote it to her calendar. After that we've been talking a bit and she has told how she would like to hang out with me if I would come to the city.

Now were here that I'm anxious and scared that I'm going to be awkward. I just want to make her evening one of the best of her life...

t3_dl5l71,Hitting up an old first-date-gone-wrong? Should I?,"Last year (19M then), I set myself up on a movie date with this girl (20F) through Tinder. I was a shy introvert trying to burst out of my bubble. During the movie, I didn't pay attention to her signals to escalate, so I just kept conversating in-between. This must have frustrated her because she made her intentions clear after the interval. Still didn't make a move. After the movie, we walked around hand-in-hand, she realised I was nervous (I told her it was my first date) and we tried finding a cosy place to settle down. But, nearby parks were crowded, and it was getting late. She wanted to go home (very conservative city, strict curfews) and so we got into a tuk-tuk and kept talking. Out of nowhere, she kissed me on my lips and what followed was a very awkward, handsy, make-out sesh. Being my first time, it was awful. She was really horny because she didn't bother stopping to correct me and escalated further, till we reached her place. I had to zip up after an unenthusiastic hand-job while getting out of the tuk-tuk (which was embarrassing AF). I couldn't close with a hug, because ""people who knew her would see"" (literally no-one), so I thought this was the end. Quite a horrible date for both parties involved, both of us could've done better, and no-one got off.

A few days later, after she left for college (in another city), she hit me up on Snap and asks me to sext with her, so that she could get off. Being my first attempt at that too, you can guess how it went. She was not that great either. I always felt nervous (so, no good pics to send there if you know what I mean), was kinda desperate (same as her) and those chats she saved (didn't delete it till now for some reason) makes me kinda want to cringe and laugh at how bad we both were.

This happened some more times, and I was always just as nervous. She did seem frustrated sometimes (I could tell). I took a few days off mid-semester to go home and got a little lucky there. In my naivete, I told her very bluntly that I gained some more experience since our first time and tried to set up a date when she came back. She ignored it with an ""Ok"", and we kept awkwardly sexting now-and-then through that semester. Come summer vacation, I tried to set up a second ""date"", but it never materialised. She flaked twice but kept sexting, and I kept giving it to her. After a while, it died down, I went abroad for summer school, and the following two semesters, I got some action, and so I quickly forgot about the whole affair.

Until a few months ago, that is. This girl randomly hit me up with a ""Hey"" and left the chat after a little small talk. I checked my Tinder to see if she was in town (she was), and a few days later, I asked her what she was up to. She lied by saying that she was still at college, so I just said bye and didn't bother. Now, I have a terrible urge to hit her up one more time and have a conversation about everything that went wrong the first time and go out on a proper date again. A second chance, if you will. I know people will tell me to forget about the second date, but should I have this conversation with her at least? What do you think, Reddit?",dating_advice

t3_dl4uyi,"Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late"," 

Three days ago, I watched the film Ten Things I Hate About You, the 1999 teenage romantic comedy with Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as two high schoolers who fall in love with each other. They were actually in their teens when the film was shot, which I found really surprising. This movie has been on my mind for the past few days. I found the relationship Kat and Patrick had to be really believable, even something teenagers could find themselves in, which made me think about why I have never been in a relationship in my life.

Some things about me: I‚Äôm a twenty-five-year-old man. I work as a teacher. And I want to know what it‚Äôs like to fall in love with a beautiful woman before I shuffle off this mortal coil. I‚Äôve found in my reflection that I haven‚Äôt done a whole lot to actually make this happen, although I will say that my 25-year-old self will actually make the effort to ask out a woman I‚Äôve never talked to before. But I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôm struggling with.

I have a pretty athletic physicality from running marathons and half marathons, I‚Äôm pretty smart, and I‚Äôm kind and patient toward my students. I care about building positive relationships with students so that it‚Äôs easier for them to approach me and complain or ask questions. If you met me, you might be surprised that I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. (If you met one of my sisters, I think you would be surprised, too, at how, at the age of 31, she‚Äôs never been in a relationship, even though she has a great personality and is super successful.)

Now, I‚Äôve laughed about my inability to get a date for years, but as time has passed, I have grown more and more tired of laughing. The question, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like to kiss a woman?‚Äù needs to be finally answered and the question ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs getting in the way of you falling in love?‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be posed a year from now. I‚Äôm serious about this. The passage of time can provide the illusion of progress, and it‚Äôs easy to convince myself that I have gotten better at talking to attractive women over the years, but that is more so a result of experience than it is of maturity.

I‚Äôve asked four women out on a date over the past three years. One said yes and three said no. Now, that‚Äôs not bad at all in terms of percentages. Baby, I got a 25% success rate! (That‚Äôs for the time being.) But that is abysmal in terms of how often I make a serious effort to get a date, which leads me to my first honest question.

I work at a school that doesn‚Äôt have any women my age looking for a relationship. I live in a neighborhood that‚Äôs full of apartments full of people who don‚Äôt talk to each other or spend time outside. Simply put, where do I position myself so that it becomes much, much, much more likely for me to meet attractive women my age? And how do I muster up the emotional strength to drag myself to these places and events when I have to grade assignments and create lesson plans for much of my free time? Volunteering seems like my best option, especially since I want to meet somebody with a generous spirit. I live in a moderately-sized city, so the idea of going to meetups to meet people with similar interests is somewhat possible. All in all, though, it‚Äôs hard finding the time to date when I‚Äôm working a lot as a teacher.

Once I have found my target, how do I approach her without resorting to pickup lines or coming across as inauthentic or rehearsed or aloof or practically uninterested? I have read terrible advice for this across the interwebs and feel close to despair. How do I properly convey to a stranger that I am romantically interested in her without making her squeal in terror?

Once I am in the thick of it, the setting of the date has been established, the time has arrived and so has she, how do I let her know that 1. I am serious about finding someone who is a good fit for me--somebody whose tough and patient and creative--to be partners for life? and 2. that I won‚Äôt dilly dally in making small talk, that I‚Äôll cut to the chase and begin building intimacy?

I appreciate your feedback. Now I might be a little loopy from all the Dayquil I‚Äôve taken recently, but it‚Äôs no bother.",dating_advice

Basically, run of the mill sort of story. Guy dates girl for 5 1/2 years, girl breaks-up with him, girl enters new relationship less than two weeks after said break-up. Guy and girl never talk again. This is what happened to me, and its been less than a year since said break up and I am having some real difficulties. I can't seem to trust people enough to be vulnerable around them and it sucks because I can't establish anything serious. I tend to meet girls, talk to them and things will being going great. Then usually they try to establish something serious, and all of a sudden, with no warning...I feel absolutely nothing but the urge to withdraw. Now, this is a sh\*t thing to do, you end up really hurting people and leaving them confused as to how you could just feel nothing all of a sudden. But this is what has been reoccurring for me now probably 5x over.

t3_dl4iof,How can I attract women's attention romantically and get beyond the friend zone or acquaintance zone?,"Throwaway for my own personal reasons. Single-purpose account. Details changed for anonymity.

I'm 33/M, British and single. For now, I live at home with family, but no shame in admitting that, it's common enough as it is nowadays.

Currently with regard to dating; good at making and being friends with women, not so good at flirting with them or getting beyond the friend zone.

I'm better at being friends with women than knowing when to ask them out, that's where I get stuck at.

I'm in decent shape - go to the gym, people say I'm interesting to talk to and I'm considered likeable.

Anyway... on to the main issue.

I want to get more confident at flirting with women but *do not* want to be seen as a pick-up artist or sleazy individual. I'm more interested in actually dating than being a ""player"".

I'll mention two situations I go to where I meet people:

Small convenience store selling European foods: I often go for the snack foods and drinks (the Polish chocolate is excellent, as good as Cadbury's) or the European beers and I go every now and then. Sometimes I see women but lack much confidence to talk to them; except, maybe, for the shop assistants. I'd say I was a semi-regular, not regular there. I'll admit, I like going to foreign food shops in my area mainly  for the food and can get very into choosing what to get and forget that it's also a social thing (there to see people, get advice on food and drink etc.), not just buying food! (I'm the sort of person that likes to try new foods... if not cook them).

Also, I don't really have friends who can introduce me to single people; the friends I do have often have young kids and families of their own, and my co-workers are older than me. (I like my job, so risking it to date a co-worker would be wrong).

I'm struggling to find a new activity to meet people. I'm not sporty, so sport is out for me, and going the gym is just a family activity.

I know the types of women I'm attracted to; women who have a pleasant, kind personality (nice is probably too generic a word) and are feminine in aesthetic/behaviour (I've never really been into tomboyish women romantically; as friends, yes).

I'm also attracted to Indian women too, but it's not a race fetish; it goes back to when I was 19 and a student in university and knew Jane (not her real name), an Indian woman (at the time aged 20, this was way back in 2005) who was the ""cool girl"" within my social circle at the time, if not my class. I was friends with her, but that was as far as it got.

I just get stuck in the friend zone/acquaintance zone and would like to get beyond it and more competent. It's this area of life I want to improve in.

t3_dl44lh,Am I wrong for making my love interest feel like he's walking on eggshells?,"I'm falling for this guy. We're not in a committed relationship yet. We're both 30, and have had LTRs in the past. We have a deep intense connection (physically, emotionally, sexually) in the short time we've known each other.

I told him that I have some reservations and our last argument gave us a setback. He said something about us being incompatible over a miscommunication that we had, and his overreaction is lingering in my mind b/c I'm gravitating towards thinking ""what if he gives up so easily in a committed relationship?"" He gets mad easily (him saying we're incompatible is his reaction to that anger). He was abused in his childhood and LTR, and he recognizes that he has trust, anxiety issues. He's been in therapy for 2 yrs. He is EXTREMELY self-aware &amp; intelligent. I love that about him so much. He recognizes when he's angry and he's told me that ""It's okay for me to feel angry, but I do triggered more than I should. But more importantly, my reactions aren't always healthy and I need a healthier outlet.""

Last week, I felt like he was pressuring me into deciding if we're going to enter a committed relationship. We then had this convo:

Him:

""I apologize for putting that kind of pressure on you. It's not right. A relationship should come naturally. If you decid to date me and was pressured, I would reject that. Waiting is hard, but I‚Äôm also happy with waiting b/c of the possibility that I may spend my life with you ‚ù§ and for the opportunity to practice patience&amp;empathy.

I also recognize that I have lingering issues that I thought I had resolved through therapy, and now I've become so close to you, I feel vulnerable and a desire to feel safe. It might even be unfair for you to enter a relationship w/ me until I give you reassurance that I'm improve upon these issues.""

Me: ""I feel like I'm responsible for your agonizing anxiety over the situation. That's not the kind of person I want to be in anyone's life.""

Him: ""I love that you care and are concerned about me, but in this situation, the responsibility is on me to seek healthier outlets for my feelings, and not on you. I cannot put pressure on you as I've said. The damage is already done but I'm sorry""

Me: ""I feel like now I'm making you walk on eggshells b/c you are now inclined to be less vocal.""

Him: ""In certain situations I do have to watch what I say. I know I tend to be pretty blunt, but me being silent is better than me putting unnecessary pressure on you. It would be a disservice to us both if you were pressured into dating me.""

I still feel like I'm making him walk on eggshells and he can't freely express his feelings w/ me because he fears that it might put pressure on me. Am I wrong here? I don't want to do that to him. I genuinely care for him and if I'm being an asshole, I might just let him go.

P.S. I am NOT stringing him along. I am legitimately falling for him.",dating_advice
t3_dl3xsf,Kinda insecure and don‚Äôt know what to do,"My friends and I went to a party and after that when I (20M) was going home I slept on a chair in the subway and it was like 10 pm

This happened on Friday and the next day I DM her but she didn't remember me and it was frustrating. We were both drunk but she looked better than me at the moment because she poked me and helped me out.

She's cute on her messages but she takes way too much time do answer but in the meantime, she is on-line on IG and other social media

I don't have experience in flirting and dating so I can't understand if I said something wrong or she's not interested.

When I was trying to explain to her who I am and what happened, I told her that we talked for a while then I took her home and she said ‚Äùthat's nice thank you a lot hahaha‚Äù it sounded like sarcasm and I didn't mean to said that to receive a ‚Äùthank you‚Äù I just wanted her to remember me.

After that, I haven't been in touch with him on any communication platforms since 2008  and I haven't thought about him until lately. I do not know why, but recently, I just started longing, pondering and thinking about him, perhaps it's because I visited a place recently and it reminded me about him. 

I looked him up on FB and understand that he is still single. It's been 11 years since we last met and spoke, should I reach out to him? Can he even recall who I am?

We went for drinks and stayed out late, everything was great until it was the end of the night. He had driven to the restaurant so I said I would walk him to his car(I lived within walking distance) but then he started saying we should go back to my place. I said no I didn‚Äôt want to do that on a first date, said that multiple times but he was saying he couldnt drive and I basically ended up being guilted in to having him come back to mine. I told him he could stay but that‚Äôs it, as in no sex. He stayed over but also after him trying things with me and me saying no 9or 10 times to that as well I caved and we ended up hooking up. Next morning he leaves, texts me about 30 min after he left saying he was bringing me a coffee and to come downstairs. He bought me coffee and cookie and gave it to me with a little note saying sorry for keeping me up last night.

I haven‚Äôt heard from him since, it‚Äôs been 1 day now and he also unmatched with me on the app. I‚Äôm really bothered bcus I felt so pressured into doing both of those things, and also am starting to think it‚Äôs pretty gross if he just got me coffee the next day as a gesture to make himself feel better about the night. ( In the morning he even said something to me about inviting himself over) I‚Äôm going to wait a week and if I don‚Äôt hear from would it be justified to send him a text and tell him that his behaviour is and was not ok ?.

t3_dkzxi5,should I date her or call if off or take my time?,"  

Hi guys, 

I‚Äôm a little confused right now with regards to a dating a girl. We‚Äôve been dating for couple of months. Mostly it was texting during the week and drunk sex after a night of hanging out with the larger group of friends (common friends). 

Unlike my last relationship wherein I rushed too early into the whole thing, I was keeping it slow and getting to know her over time. A little bit of flirting here and there and conversations more around getting to know each other. I thought doing it this way, we‚Äôd figure things out and eventually take a call if were to take this forward or not. 

However, over the course of time there are certain habits that have been annoying me for a bit. I mean she‚Äôs fine other way around ‚Äì an art teacher, got things to talk about and stuff. But she gets drunk every time we‚Äôre out ‚Äì breaking glasses/cutlery, tripping around- essentially becomes disoriented to the extent that I end up baby-sitting her. I‚Äôm a very outgoing person and I like to enjoy as much, thus with this taking place every time I end just disappointed. Also, she‚Äôs a little loud when she speaks, which I thought I could discard considering being a teacher especially in a school you end up yelling a lot and eventually that becomes your secondary habit. But again, when we‚Äôre out or partying some place indoors it becomes annoying handling her drunk and loud side. I end up apologizing to strangers a lot. 

Now- it‚Äôs been about 2 months now of knowing each other, and suddenly in a drunk state she ended up putting out the question of ‚Äúwhat if I fall in love with you‚Äù ‚Äì I knew she was drunk and tripping on some molly but that threw me a little off-guard. Followed by some blurred insta story with that love sign. The last time we hung out together, I was kinda really annoyed with the drunk + loud scene and made it apparent that needed my own space ‚Äì don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd remember that. 

Now I don‚Äôt know what to do? Should I give it more time to figure things out? Are these habits worth ignoring to figure the bigger picture? I mean she‚Äôs chill and all but I‚Äôm not able to find the positives on this one like real bad. I don‚Äôt want the dynamics of the friend‚Äôs group either to be disturbed too. Should I call things off? If so, what should be the reason ‚Äì am I not ready for commitment ? or have the talk first with her to figure out where she thinks we are? 

Help guys, wanna get done with this confused scene as soon as possible.",dating_advice

I just think he is replying out of politeness cause he used to make the talk a lot more fun.
For example, last night he was more talkative than the other days, which made me think he maybe had a hard week, but then we talked about work, then food (even told me I needed to show him food from where I'm from) then randomly about some pancakes I made that gave me a stomach ache and after that he stopped replying at 1 am. Today he just replied: idk I love pancakes. üòä The old him would've said something else but I may be overthinking. My anxiety doesn't help, I just felt like it was forced.

I honestly didn't sense any discomfort the day we met but maybe he wasn't feeling it? He even said we would watch the movie next time but by the way he is acting I don't think there will be another time or maybe I'm just exaggerating, cause I overthink everything.

I just asked him if he wanted to meet again or no. Should I tell him that I feel he has friendzoned me and ask for some clearance (if so, how?), or just stop talking to him? I don't want to come off as intense but I just want to move on in case he has done the same.",dating_advice
t3_dl1irn,Dating advice for 19-year old,"Hi everyone. I'm still trying to make sense of this as I started uni about 3 months ago and everything still seems a bit absurd and unreal.

There's a girl I like that essentially invited me to invite her to volunteer at the uni student-pub about 5 days ago. I did, and it went fairly well, we got to know eachother a little better and I think I might like her romantically. I think she likes me too as she went out of her way to ask me if I was ""planning to volunteer any day soon, and that if I was, she would be happy to volunteer with me"" (paraphrasing, obviously), along with the fact she took a lot of pictures of me when we were volunteering. Which I found a little creepy, but I'll take it as a compliment.

I haven't had a girlfriend before, and I suppose I'm looking for some general tips to 1. Show her I'm interested in her, and (hopefully subsequently) 2. Establish a relationship with her. What are things to remember when establishing a relationship, and let's not get ahead of ourselves; what are good first dates where you can find out if we're even compatible? And what are good ways to ask her out?

It's also difficult for me to trust someone intimately, as I've been hurt before and I have a tendency to try to joke my way out any time I get close to anyone. If anyone has something half-ways intelligent advice I'd be glad to hear it.

The whole thing seems strange to me as I've often thought myself as someone who's ""not worth the trouble"" and I've had my fair share of depressive episodes. I suppose this is good evidence at least for me personally that self-improvement and introspection is worth the humility and grief it begets.

t3_dkyqlv,First date as a fat woman(!),"Soooooo... first time poster, not a long time lurker. I am a fat woman (32) who was in a long term relationship during her late teens &amp; 20s and didn't quite date. I started to date only a few years ago, it's been mostly fun and surprisingly insightful. 

The man (30) I need advice about, we connected on an app almost a year ago. Life happened, work travel took us to different parts of the world and while we haven't managed to meet, we kept in touch over text &amp; phone calls over the year. It's been fun banter and deep enough conversation for two people who haven't met. After an impossible schedule matching exercise, we've finally managed to fix ourselves a date soon.

Now, I am past the ""does he realize how fat I am?"" routine I used to have before first dates. But this situation is different - I kinda like this guy &amp; while I am fairly upfront about my body pictures on my profile, this was a year ago &amp; IDK what this man remembers. We follow each other on social media (not super active, don't have too many full body pics) and have sent each other pictures (including some full body pics) as you can imagine, our personal body types hasn't come up organically in conversation. Which brings us to - how do you suggest I handle this? 

Should I bring it up before the date to make sure there's no surprises? Definitely don't want someone thinking I was trying to ""trick"" them. 
Should I just be myself and not let this one insecurity  define my entire existence? The usual fat person monologue.
Should I just screenshot this and send it to him? 

I know what my therapist and fitness trainer will say, so asking a million random but objective people instead. Surprisingly open to ideas.",dating_advice

Little backstory, she  reached me out first on Instagram , we already had sex (not once ,if it's necessary) and we started a ""relationship"". All these in a wingspan of 4 weeks. The first two weeks were very good(also the stage of texting ) , good vibes, good sex. Fom my side I was a little bit concerned of how fast things were going but I didn't have a problem. When I dropped my last defences she drastically changed. For 2 weeks I was receiving mixed signals and we only met once . I thought this day we would have a conversation, but in the end we just stayed in a park kissing. Yesterday she told me she can't continue, because she doesn't feel it,but she wanted to give a try,but some reasons are holding her back (she didn't tell me) . I respect her decision and I accepted it. I think one of the reason is that I now  start to establish my working status instead of her that she is working 7 years . I don't say she wants my money or something else ,but in this age I understand she is may looking something more serious. What do you guys think , will she contact again (she told me that because we are breaking up it doesn't me she doesn't like me as a person, she would like to catch up sometimes)  or it's just over?

t3_dl0sdg,"We flirted loads and got on well. But he‚Äôs not the best with texting, should I ask him out or leave it?","(Posted this in crushes too, just incase)

There‚Äôs this guy (22) who is friends with one of my friends (let‚Äôs call her Ann) and we‚Äôve seen each other about, a couple times over the past 2 years. Recently we were all at an event that I (25) was organising and I was really stressed out but looked more sad than anything at the end. We had a very brief chat earlier on in the day and that‚Äôs the most we‚Äôve ever spoken but when he saw me at the end of the event from a distance, he could see I was sad so when he was saying bye (mouthing it rather because it was loud) he asked if he could give me a hug and I said yeah and we had another brief convo before he left. I really appreciated that and so I messaged him on a social media platform the next day just to say I appreciated how caring he was. That next evening a bunch of Ann‚Äôs friends and some people I know too went out and he was there too. Again, we didn‚Äôt talk much. He responded the following day to say he was happy he could have helped in a way and looks forward to hanging out again. So I invited him out as I had already been planning a night out for drinks with drinks with a bunch of friends including Ann and her friend who he knew so I figured it would be okay. Long story short, Ann and her friend couldn‚Äôt make it and I let him know but he was still happy to come, so it was just me, my friends and him. Do you think it‚Äôs weird that he decided to come still? It did cost a bit of money and had to be booked beforehand.
Anyway he arrived quite late so I was definitely tipsy to say the least but I already knew I wanted to flirt with him a bit. Not long after he arrived I let him know that I‚Äôd probably be flirting with him and might kiss him too, if that‚Äôs okay with him. He said consent was sexy. So we flirted a lot that night, I kissed him, we held hands pretty much the whole night. We had really good conversation with more flirting ( I can hold great convo even when drunk, high tolerance gang lol), went to grab a bite with everyone (4 of us) we were holding hands across the table, we kissed across the table. I put my ring on his hand (I usually wear it on my right) when he returned it he put it on my ring finger on my left hand. 
Throughout the night, he let me know that he doesn‚Äôt usually do a lot of the stuff he was doing, Ann told me the same too. 

Anyway it‚Äôs been two weeks and communication has been a bit shit from his end but we still talk and I like him. He‚Äôs been quite busy but I figured he would have tried to see me by now. 

He told me and Ann told me how bad he is with his phone prior, so I knew this already. Ann also let me know how he ‚Äúoperates‚Äù so I feel like knowing this, I should wait and let him take lead in that sense as I don‚Äôt want to take the lead so much and have him shut down as I do want to get to know him. The longer I wait, the quicker my feelings for him dissipate but we really just got on so well. He was also my first kiss *covers face and shrieks lol* and I like kissing him.

Should I ask him out for drinks or leave him to it? It‚Äôs hard to tell through text if he likes me but his actions that night said otherwise. Most times I have to wait a day in between responses unless he‚Äôs on the phone when I respond to him but I‚Äôm used to this now though it doesn‚Äôt get less annoying.

When we did talk, I didn't really feel like he had that much of an interest in me so I kinda just kept it friendly and never thought of him again. Like a couple days later after the bar we matched, and I'm wondering if I was wrong or if he just matched with me because he knew me. 

It's been like a week now since we've matched, and I'm thinking he just matched with me either because he's the type to swipe on everyone or just since he knows me. But at the same time I'm thinking why not just shoot him a casual message and see what happens? I don't know what do you guys think I should do?

t3_dl0eo8,Should I leave the person i'm in love with?," 

Long story short, me and my ex has a lot of back and forth. We‚Äôve almost got back together three time‚Äôs. He‚Äôs come back again, begging for me to give him a last chance. Promising change and he‚Äôll make things right and different and he won‚Äôt hurt me again. He promised he‚Äôll never break my heart again. He‚Äôs broken my heart three times, and it hurt as bad as the first. Maybe I‚Äôm stupid for saying yes. But the heart wants what it wants.

 First time he broke up with me because my depression was too much. I was boarderline suicidal. He knew about it before we got together. He used to talk to me and help me through it, he insisted I needed someone positive like him that could uplift me. But it was the reason he left me. 2nd time around he popped up, we started talking. Agreed to be exclusive but not a couple. But out of no where he stopped talking to me, aired me for about three months. Two months into it I went into a few dates with someone as I assumed that it was done with, every time I spoke to him he‚Äôd just not reply? I guessed he moved on, so I decided to. He came back and called me a cheater and all the names under the sun. But then turned around and forgave me and admitted he put me in a box for when he wanted. After all of that he came back around and said he wanted to continue to giving it a go. He had feelings for me. But as soon as I left his house he once again aired me and said he wasn‚Äôt feeling it.

Left it at that. Each time it hurt just as bad but I accepted it. He practically begged me for another shot and how he fucked up and was wrong and he needed me. He‚Äôs been nothing but sweet. But I almost feel like the pain is always going to be there..

He hasn‚Äôt given me a reason to feel otherwise. He‚Äôs been good, he‚Äôs been sweet. I love him, it‚Äôs undeniable I love him with my whole heart. But something feels off. Already, a month in. It just feels.. almost not right, you‚Äôd think the ‚Äòhoneymoon stage‚Äô would last a little longer considering we‚Äôve finally rekindled. As if I feel like Things are sinking to what it used to be? I have dread in my heart.

I‚Äôm so certain I want to have a life with him, grow, have a family. I genuinely thought of having a family with him. He‚Äôs the absolute love of my life. So why do I feel so unhappy?

Is it time for me to call it quits for good? I just don‚Äôt know.

The next day we plan to go to a haunted house, so I drive down to her place, we sit and talk for awhile, then we decided against that because it was another hour drive. So we go get some food and go to a bar for a more open setting to talk and have fun. 

We had a great time, we didn‚Äôt get drunk, then we went back to her house and she asked me to stay over. So I did. Nothing physical happened besides when I asked if I could kiss her.

I went up there to talk to her about another (unrelated situation) and J was there sleeping on the couch also. I had a short conversation with J and I suppose I woke her up and she left the room. Later on J also leaves the room and goes to his bed to fall asleep. I go downstairs to look for her and she was no where to be found. I thought it was odd but I went back upstairs and as I passed his bedroom I heard them both talking.

t3_dkxknj,Asking someone out at work,"I like a girl at work and expressed my interest and was rejected. I like a different girl as well but haven't got over the first one. I'm worried that if I ask out the second one and she says no, the first will hear about it and think 'what a loser, I was definitely right to say no'. Am I looking at this in the wrong way? Should I wait and see if they make the first move instead? With regards to the first girl I haven't let go of the hope she might change her mind, as I suspect age difference was a factor in her decision and I do think we had chemistry/attraction.

t3_dkviti,Me [19M] dating [19F] (first gf) at my college and not sure how much hanging out is too much,"Heyo,
So I matched with this girl on bumble about 3 weeks ago and we hit it off. Went on a study date the first night then second night we made out and have been on like 10+ dates. She deleted her bumble and said that she wants to be in a official, exclusive relationship.
It‚Äôs been amazing, she‚Äôs my first girlfriend and I have had a great time.

However, I‚Äôm not sure if we are hanging out too much. Last week we hung out Monday-Thursday (twice for only an hour and twice for like 5 hours) . I went home from Thursday night- Sunday and she met me tonight when I came back and we grabbed dinner. Is this too much? I really don‚Äôt want to screw this up and have her get bored.  Tonight she did seem a little bit less enthusiastic but still happy to see me so idk. 

I have read that some people try to play hard to get because that keeps a woman interested I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs valid since we are in a relationship already.

I‚Äôd been chatting with this guy on an app for a three weeks and one day we finally decided to meet up. I‚Äôll have you know we were intoxicated (not to a worrying degree) and he came over and we just cuddled and kissed ONCE. But he was way more affectionate than I am used to. Towards the morning he kept delaying his time to leave and stayed with me until he almost missed his shift at work (ahaha yeah I‚Äôm that good). 

So we continued to talk everyday and then I went on uni break for only two weeks and went back home. When I was home my friend had said she‚Äôd found him on Tinder and he had uploaded two new images and changed his bio up. So he‚Äôs still using the app? 

Anyway, I get over that and the messages have been fewer and far between I wasn‚Äôt getting ‚Äòhow was your day‚Äô or anything I‚Äôd just get one message and then I got left on read.

It‚Äôs been 6 days and he‚Äôs been active online. I know I sound super juvenile but I don‚Äôt know I just thought this time I‚Äôd be different.

Anyway, I‚Äôd just like to get some input from strangers on the internet. Any response from a make point of view would be helpful.

Ok, so I‚Äôm super sad and heartbroken right now. I have had feelings for this guy for months. I wish I knew he had a girlfriend before I started develop feelings.
Our relationship is good coworkers and we are friendly to each other.

Well one night, he got super drunk and started drunk texting me. He basically confessed that he likes me. I asked him don‚Äôt you still have a girlfriend and he told me yes. He said there‚Äôs a lot of issues between them and he‚Äôs thinking about leaving her. He didn‚Äôt say leave her for me. And he‚Äôs still super drunk. 

I‚Äôm friends with one of his best friends. I‚Äôm going to call him AJ. AJ told me that all they do is argue and he‚Äôs told AJ multiple times that he‚Äôs thinking about ending the relationship with her. AJ doesn‚Äôt like his girlfriend and they do not get along. AJ can‚Äôt even text him when my crush is with his gf because she will get mad. 

Now that my crush is sober, he‚Äôs back to being his professional, shy self again. He hasn‚Äôt texted me much since. Nor did he even mention the texts he sent me. 

He took a whole week off to celebrate him and his girlfriend‚Äôs 5 year anniversary. However, AJ told me that my crush told him that he is thinking about ending the relationship 1 day before he went on vacation.

So now I‚Äôm confused. Why does he keep talking about breaking up with her and never acts upon it? Is he just using me as a gateway from his girlfriend? 
Should I wait for them to break up or move on? 

I just don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to this about and I want to avoid getting my feelings hurt. What should I do? Thanks",dating_advice

t3_dkwwaj,I feel played. I feel pathetic for feeling the way I do.,"  

So, I met this guy at a club, and he asked for my number and I gave it to him. He texted me a couple days later to set up a date and I went with it; I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was really attracted to him, but I gave it a go. 

On Monday we hung out for a couple hours and got ice cream, he was nice, and we had a good conversation. We kissed, held hands, he walked me home, and it was a pretty good evening overall. On Tuesday he invited me to go to the library and study with him. We had a good conversation and we made each other laugh, and I started to feel comfortable around him. After studying, he held my hand and took me to some fancy coffee and dessert shop with him, and he even asked the waiter to take a picture of us. He walked me all the way home and he kept complimenting me on things that he liked about my personality and physical appearance, he was being so nice. 

The next day he calls me and sets up a date for Thursday and I accept. On Thursday he picks me up and he takes me to this luxury movie theater (each movie ticket was like 50 dollars lol) where he got us premium seats to watch a movie I really wanted to see. We got milkshakes afterwards and we spent six hours talking and kissing and getting to know each other. He even mentioned my birthday and remembered the exact date, which was so weird but in a good way. It seemed like he cared about me and had some feelings for me. 

But after Thursday, I haven‚Äôt heard from him in almost 4 days. For anyone who‚Äôs wondering, we didn‚Äôt have sex or anything of that sort. 

I‚Äôm so disappointed and hurt because I feel played. I don‚Äôt know why he would act so romantic and sweet and tell me personal information about himself if he didn‚Äôt really care at all. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs a player or what, but this is cruel. He gave me affection and warmth, and now he‚Äôs acting like I don‚Äôt exist. I haven‚Äôt tried texting him, and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to text me again, but I feel played. I was open with him and I let my guard down a little by kissing him and spending that time with him, and it feels like he was just playing with my emotions.

t3_dkyus4,"Recently single female, how soon is too soon to start dating again (in your opinion)? Amongst other things.","I broke up with my Ex about 3 weeks ago. It was really difficult, but I have to keep convincing myself that it was the right thing to do. We both needed self development. He told me that I should find someone else to find what I'm looking for (to figure out if I really miss him, or just the idea of him). 

But Jesus fucking Christ, it's like I'm wading through 100 boners just to find a decent man. All these guys came out of the woodwork. A lot of them I knew from high school, and they still act like they're in high school! It makes me sick. One of them was like ""What's your snap cutie üòâü§≠"", and I told him to please not call me that (he even asked me if I was still IN high school). Then the conversation still continued, he was so immature.. ugh! And another guy, he was supposed to help me rebuild my PC, and he had the nerve to ask me out the *same day* I broke up with my Ex! What the hell? His excuse was ""Well I did ask you out first before that guy"" (???). Who the hell are these people, have they ever been in a relationship? It just makes me feel gross, and their compliments do not work. Sorry for the vent.

I just fear that if I wait too long, I won't find anyone. I don't go out much to begin with. I'm also of the opinion that it's good to make friends with someone first before taking the next step. The dating scene is looking pretty terrible right now, and I keep thinking how I met my Ex was my last opportunity to find someone (naturally). There's a young shop owner guy I met, I actually talked to him a lot, and I was proud of myself. He's really nice and we have a lot in common. But he has a girlfriend. 

Like, what if I establish myself as a single person, and get my own house. I feel that it'll be hard for me to decide on a guy to move in with me, or me giving up my place to be with him. I do not want to sacrifice my things for something that won't work out. I don't know what to do.",dating_advice
t3_dkujye,How do you remain patient while dating?,"I've [23 M] dated a couple of ladies since I began University (about 3 years ago) and each of the relationships went really well. Each time, though, the relationship ended on the woman's terms with them telling me that there was no reason the relationship was going poorly, that they just felt they needed to move on. One of them ended up getting married, and the other went on a church mission. I've accepted how those relationships ended after a while of being bitter. Both times I genuinely felt like they were the person I was going to marry. 

Since then, I've not had a successful 2nd date and I'm finding myself getting discouraged.

t3_dkw4si,"I [23F] started dating this guy [23M] almost two months ago and we really like each other but he's too busy for a relationship, what should I do?","* We started seeing each other at the beginning of last month and we really like each other. We're exclusive (not talking to or sleeping with anyone else). We've gone out probably twice a week since we met. We text/keep in touch with each other throughout the day. The dates are set up days in advance, not the very same night.
* We've gone out to eat, he's taken me to a hockey game, he's taken me out for drinks/dessert before etc... Normal dating stuff. He's slept over a couple times but has made it clear that that throws him off his schedule with work/studying.
* Basically: I can expect to see him one day after work to study together for 3-4 hours at the library. I can expect to see him one night during the weekend but not for him to sleep over. Usually this is from around 8pm-1am.
* He already graduated from university earlier this year and started his career. I'm still in university. He JUST got promoted to a more important position that will require learning new things and a larger time commitment at work. He's also been studying for a big exam he has later this year in relation to his career and his certifications. His time outside of work is almost entirely spent studying or with family.
* This past weekend, he had something late and was able to come to my apartment around 10:30pm and had to leave two hours after. We didn't go out of my apartment; we just stayed in and had sex a few times. I felt hurt, even though I know it wasn't his intention, when he left.
* We got into a fight today because he could tell I was upset last night when he left. I told him that I didn't like that it felt like a hook-up/fuck buddy kind of thing and that I'm not looking for that. I told him I understand he's busy but I want to spend my time doing things other than just sex with him, even if it's not big things.
* He told me he understood. I told him I was not expecting more time from him or for him to change his priorities. Just that I didn't want it to feel like a hook-up. I asked him what he considered me as, and he told me he genuinely enjoys spending time with me and has been trying to fit me in as much as possible but his priorities are work/studying and that he can't really add a relationship to that right now.

**tl;dr:** We're both 23 and have been dating for almost two months. He's super busy with a new career/promotion and has been studying for an exam coming up. I see him a couple times a week. We fought recently because I was upset when one night felt like a hook-up. He told me he really enjoys spending time with me but that his priorities are work/studying and spending time with his family and that it's not possible for him to fit a relationship in right now.

So... *where the fuck do I go from here?* Is it not worth my time? I really enjoy spending time with him and I believe him when he says he's busy because... he is. He does try to fit me into the very small amount of free time he has, sometimes seeing me during the weekend but not his friends. I told him I didn't really care too much about labels/commitment, I just wanted the time we have to not always be about sex. We were like 'okay cool, good talk!' at the end.

Should I just wait it out and try my best not over-think it? His exam is in early December so maybe I'll see how busy he is then or if feelings have developed more. It's weird being in the middle ground of kind of being in a relationship but not able to dive into it. It would be nice to be in a relationship with him, eventually, once he has time....

t3_dkvqm0,I reconnected with an old friend I used to like and I told him how I feel. I'm not sure what he wants. Now what?,"Throwaway.

I (22F) went to summer sleepaway camp in New England with this guy (23/4M) when we were in early high school. I had a tiny crush on him back then, and at camp he was close with two good friends from my hometown and a group of other girls that I also loved dearly (relevant). At this camp, we had scheduled time for hugging three times a day following certain activities (I‚Äôm not kidding and yes, also relevant haha).

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve graduated college and moved from New England to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado for a job. One night, after a few glasses of ros√©, I‚Äôm trolling around on tinder and see a guy with a bio I thought matched me pretty well: ‚Äúreading is sexy, I like girls that are somewhere between dirty hippies and giant nerds.‚Äù This man had super liked me. Turns out it was the guy from camp‚Ä¶ he messaged me saying he almost didn‚Äôt recognize me. Anyway, we catch up and make plans to hike a fourteener that weekend (14,000 feet above sea level, not a hike you go into lightly).

That hike went great and even at one point when I was really struggling from super strong winds, he said something very thoughtful and encouraging. That‚Äôs when I felt everything start to come back. That was a great day, but at the same time, I was confused because I couldn't tell what the vibe was: were we old friends, or were we old friends now going on dates?

I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in about two weeks when he asked me to go hiking again last weekend. We went and when we got to our spot (secluded by an alpine lake) I said ‚Äúhey, I don‚Äôt want to make things weird by saying this because I like being your friend but I had a baby crush on you at camp and it‚Äôs coming back.‚Äù I hope I‚Äôm remembering correctly, I kinda just was out of my body for a bit, but some of the things he said to me were: ‚ÄúAw, that‚Äôs cute but even if Emma Stone walked up to me right now and asked me to date her I‚Äôd be on the fence. I haven‚Äôt dated anyone in a year. Making moves is hard for me. Don‚Äôt get discouraged.‚Äù And from there I said, ‚Äúyeah, I kinda just felt like I had to say that and also I haven't actually cared about someone I was interested in in a year. But I‚Äôm going to leave it up to you to make moves now. \*\*flirty voice\*\*‚Äù Mainly said that because I didn‚Äôt want to move too fast and also didn‚Äôt want to be desperate. Things were pretty much normal on the back end of the hike, he bought us ice cream after and the clerk asked us a cute question that made me think she thought we had been dating for a long time. Which made me smile inside. 

He came up from Denver (about a 1.5 hour drive, he‚Äôs between seasonal jobs currently) on Wednesday to help me move into my new place. I taught him a few chords on my guitar while I was driving my car full of shit down the interstate and it was adorable. He was a little flirty too (not a ton but at select moments). And we got tacos and beers after and nothing happened (I paid for the beers as a thank you). I said I would text him to hike again soon. We have tentative plans to see a concert in Denver in a few weeks.

I‚Äôm at an impasse. I feel like I have no ability to judge if what he was saying when I told him I was interested was actually the truth or if it was a way of letting me down easy and maintaining the friendship. It‚Äôs hard for me to judge the flirtiness level of our hugs because we went to camp with time set aside for hugging. It‚Äôs hard for me to judge his interest in me as opposed to other girls because he tends to have a lot of women friends, so I could very easily be another. Should I consider him a friend and try to move on? Should I give it time? Should I keep flirting and give him space to make a move or should I just act like nothing happened? Should I flirt harder (I‚Äôve been pretty relaxed/subtle with him and not laying it on as thick as I normally would)?

He‚Äôs a sweet person and I feel very relaxed around him. I don‚Äôt need/want things to go fast, I just need to know what I‚Äôm looking at. I don't feel like I can ask again since I already made my intentions clear. And I think the fact that I actually am emotionally invested is clouding my ability to judge his actions clearly.

Any and all advice appreciated. Thank you.",dating_advice
t3_dkt2rr,Proper texting cadence before first date,"Hello Everyone, 

I wanted other people's perspective on how often to text before the first date.  Say you have a date set one week out, how often would you reach out to them?

I usually like to meet up pretty quickly, but when the date isn't for a while I've always felt the need to send them something every three days or so.

She was going away with some girlfriends for the weekend, and I told her I would text her on Sunday to see how her weekend went.  

Is this generally a good idea, or does it come off as desperate?  Should you only text the day before to confirm the date, or is it good to keep the ""spark"" alive with a short texting conversation somewhere in the middle?

I asked her 2 times if she wanted to hang out, and both times she said she's already got plans with her friend (and friend's bf). She's been talking to other guys, and recently she posted on Snapchat how cute she thinks her friend s boyfriend is, which set me off pretty well. I really don't know what I'm doing wrong other than giving too much effort which I wouldn't think is a bad thing. I don't see anything between me and her if this behavior continues which is a shame for me to say since I'm not as outgoing and being able to put myself out there to introduce myself was an accomplishment for me.

Now before i got the idea that she only liked me as a coworker so in a way i just bottled down the feelings and went on with my job however yesterday or Saturday ( as I am writing this at 1 A.m on Monday) was very strange yet nice to me.

Fast forward about 15 minutes later she calls me and tells me to come over to her she than tells me i can pick out any song that is used,and she would play it on the intercom soo i choose Hall and Oates since it was the nearest one and because i also like it, little did ik she also likes Hall And Oates so i was in work singing while working,and i remember looking over at her while she was talking to my other female coworker and she just smiled and sort of giggled,that ofc made me feel great so i found her by the music section and found her looking at me as well (she is shy btw) so i just did some small talk and found out she likes the same food as me and is even a local at my favorite restaurant that i am also a local too, she eventually tells me when Maneater comes on i gotta dance with her so ofc i said i would, I go on my 10 around 6:40 and around 6:48 she comes in with a smile and says ""songs on you gonna dance?""

t3_dkskc1,"How can I (24M) date women when I don‚Äôt think I can compete with all of the other, more amazing guys they could be dating?","I‚Äôve been thinking about dating for a long time since my breakup last year, and one thing that always stood out was how quickly she found another guy who was way better than me. More successful, more mature, younger, fitter, confident... he was just better for her. I ended up crying myself to sleep every night for 2 months thinking about how shitty I am and how most women could look at a guy like me and say ‚Äúpass.‚Äù 

In her eyes, I‚Äôm not hot, I‚Äôm a 7 or 6/10 at best. I‚Äôm fit but still have love handles. I‚Äôm a graduate but only barely. I have a job but it pays little. I have a car but it‚Äôs not cool. I still live at home and can‚Äôt afford to move out nor can I find a better job. I try to look at myself with compassion but it‚Äôs hard when I am objectively less dateable than a lot of men my age (24).

Honestly, dating seems like a waste of time for both me and the women I‚Äôd be interested in because they‚Äôd soon find my life boring and trite, just like she did. Im not content with just sitting around moping so I do work on myself a lot and go to therapy, but I still feel miserable sometimes knowing how lacking and how imperfect I am. I‚Äôm not some shining knight, or a hero, or a success story. I‚Äôm barely worth it as I am, and I know I can be so much more but I feel like I can‚Äôt even live up to my own standards, let alone those of the good women I know and would like to date. Fuck it, guess it‚Äôs back to getting angry at myself for not changing  or being better and punching myself in the face till I bruise.

Tl;dr: I feel less dateable than other men and I can‚Äôt seem to find a way to change my mind about this. Therapy for this isn‚Äôt working and I‚Äôm upset that I haven‚Äôt become better.",dating_advice

t3_dkoqgv,All my dates all either want a quick shag or to be friends,"Hi dating advice. I'm completely aware as I [m] write this post that I'm clearly the common denominator.

I'm invited in, but I decline, as I'm not really a ONS guy, or I go back on my merry way, feeling happy.

2 days later, I'm either ghosted, or they say that they are just feeling a friendship chemistry. I just can't work out what's going wrong; this has been the pattern of my last 10 dates. What really prompted this post is that someone that I'd been planning a second date with rung me up to say that she just wasn't feeling an attraction. She thanked me for behaving like a gentleman, and apparently ""real gentleman are rare"" her words. When I asked her what it was, she just said ""gut feeling"". I don't know how to work with this. I'm meant to be meeting up with her as friends later this week to play some chilled poker. Shall I press this issue?

I feel like I‚Äôm always the one slowing down our relationship because of my inexperience, physically for obvious reasons but emotionally as well. Recently he had casually asked what our relationship was and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to define it. We do everything that a couple that is dating would do, we just haven‚Äôt put a label on it.

Since I hit middle school I've been focusing on my education and grades, while having very little time for myself and now that I'm in a bit of a slow patch in my classes (nothing difficult or even stressful really) I've started to become almost anxious realizing how old I am without having even asked anyone out. I don't have a father figure in my life I could ask about this so I guess I'm resorting to reddit. Just thinking about it right now is making me tremble from nerves alone haha. There's a girl in one of my classes who's adorable and I really want to talk to her but I don't even know if she's even noticed me or anything, I have no idea how to pick up on body language or anything. Furthermore just the idea of approaching her to talk to her is making me anxious.

I suppose for a summary of what I'm hoping to gain from posting this is

A) When you're crushing on someone, what's the best way to approach them, particularly if you've never really talked to them?

B) When asking someone out, what's something appropriate to do? Coffee or should it be something Dinner?

C) How do I avoid making an ass of myself in front of someone?

D) What kind of body language can you use to tell if someone's into you or not into you?",dating_advice

t3_dkwkr7,I (M22) have a crush on my new friend/coworker (F18),"I work the overnight shift at a coffee shop, and in September we got a new coworker (Cayleigh) who is a friend with another coworker/friend. (Anthony) 

While I worked with Cayleigh twice where she worked till midnight, we got along decently well and found out we liked the same music. On our third shift together it was our first time working together entirely solo. (2 of us in the shop, 7.5 hours) and we clicked like crazy. Anthony visits us so they can take a break and smoke weed in the parking lot, and I guess Anthony told her I struggle with depression because she would periodically over the drive thru headset say ""Tyran you are a wonderful man. Love yourself."" Stuff like that.

On my birthday she sent happy birthday!!! With like 20 blue heart emojis.

In mid September I asked her to go hiking. She's much more in shape than me and rock climbs, so my fat ass struggled a bit but she left me for a bit because she wanted to climb to the peak of the mountain. When she came back down after being gone 30 minutes we talked for an hour about her life and growing up, and then we went to lunch at a chinese place. (She paid since I drove to the hike) (also made fun of my driving skills oops) i told her I enjoy her company, and she said ""don't worry, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon."" after the hike I paused before shaking her hand and she said it was okay to hug her.

A week later on a Thursday, I asked her if we could hang out again Friday or Saturday, she said she's taking her dog on an advanced hike and Saturday she works. Problem is our shifts don't start till 9pm and when we hiked I worked, so I was a little stung.

When we worked together, we still get along, I once gave her shit for how she was making a drink and when I found out she made it right, I wrote her a ""I'm sorry ;-; "" note and when she read it she stood up and hugged me and said it was okay.


I texted Anthony I had a crush on her, and he brushed it off that I was being dumb ""you always have crush on girls who work graveyard"". A week later, when working with him, I talked to Anthony that I was serious. He told me as of 2 days ago she was dating a mutual friend.

That relationship lasted a week, she ended it with him because she liked him better as a friend and there was red flags. 

She still finds ways to sneak in hugs, she came in after being outside because she was cold and went to hug me. I still occassionally get blue hearts in texts. When she notices I'm down she asks me what's wrong and seems very caring.

We don't work much together, and I want to find some way to tell her that I like her without being too pushy, or too creepy. Ya know? Definitely want to give her time, I'm curious what the red flags are but I'm wondering if the breakup was handled worse than she'll say. Especially since she wants to know when her ex and his friends stop by. I don't want to tell her I'm in love with her or anything. Lmao help please

t3_dkwjs6,What do you guys make of this text?,"To me, I feel that this means ""Sorry but I'm not interested in you.""  But I'm not sure I trust my own judgement.

This girl and I are really close, so I could see it being a friend zone situation.  But I want to get some other opinions.  

For context, she was telling me she thinks I'm really smart and that I would get along with her grandfather.  They were having some sort of formal party and she asked me to go with her, so I asked if she meant as a friend or as her date.  When she said as a friend, I told her (nicely) that I wasnt comfortable with that because putting on a suit to go meet her family feels like a boyfriend thing to me.  Here is the text:

*""No. please.. You don't 
understand, I don't mean 
anything by this. I told you 
this months ago. Why can't 
we just be friends? You don't

t3_dkwjiq,Dating with a deadline,"I‚Äôm super conflicted.

I‚Äôm dating this amazing person who totally understands me and supports me. However, they‚Äôve revealed in the 2nd month they‚Äôll be moving in a few months to another city.

This person keeps telling me how much they like me, and would love to continue dating - only each other - until then. By that time we will have seen/ dated each other for 7 months. Currently we have been seeing each other for 5 months. 

They have no intentions of becoming more serious. They don‚Äôt want to commit to something long distance. I have asked. (It‚Äôs 2 hour 30 minute trip between our cities). But this person wants me to continue investing my feelings, time and effort, as if we were properly dating with no deadline.

This person feels as if it‚Äôs a really good thing to do. But I feel as if I am constantly being torn between the enjoyment of being with this person, and the constant reminder that this will not last. It feels like torture. Because I am at that point where I‚Äôve grown really strong feelings. 

Sometimes I also feel that they are benefitting from it more than I am. Because my feelings are more invested, I feel I am contributing the most effort ( cooking for them, helping them clean their house, I am the one that always travels to - we live an hour from each other). Consequently, making me feel as if I am being used. But they are so nice to me that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being used. This person has been the nicest person I‚Äôve dated for a while, and the one I have connected most too.

they also say stuff like; ‚Äúyou would have been such a great person to be in a relationship with.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in my city we should meet-up again‚Äù And ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad I met you and got to spend some of this time with you.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs great to hear, but I also feel like it is false affirmation in order to keep me around? 

Am I hurting myself dating someone who I will most likely never see again? 
Should we stop dating each other?
Am I being super negative? and should I try to enjoy the time we have left?
Am I crazy for sticking around this far? 
Should we still keep in touch when they leave. Is that healthy? Because I feel If i did they‚Äôre just benching me.",dating_advice
t3_dkwifb,Keeping Her Ex as a Backup is Ruining our Dynamic,"Within the past month I(26M) started becoming good friends and sleeping with this girl(22F) I was acquaintances with for the past year. She‚Äôs been heavily hinting at getting together with me in a relationship capacity over the past 2 weeks. 

The issue is she‚Äôs still in contact with her ex(25M) who is constantly trying to get back with her and who lives overseas in her home country. They were together for over a year prior and she dumped him at the start of this year, but she‚Äôs kept him as a bit of a backup. When we‚Äôre together she keeps overtly hinting about finding a future husband to me and telling people she wants to marry me and shit. Anyway, I‚Äôve told her I‚Äôm not interested in that level of commitment to a single girl for the time being, but her ex is more than willing to. 

The main reason for me not committing is due to her entanglement with this ex and because we haven‚Äôt been dating, just hooking up after drinks in our friend group and seeing each other in otherwise platonic situations. Recently she visited her home country and hooked up with her ex. And next month the two of them are spending a week together overseas on a holiday. 

Yet after hooking up with her ex she‚Äôs still very forward about wanting to be in relationship with me. She‚Äôs said that after the overseas trip with her ex she‚Äôs considering cutting him off completely and her friends and family have all told her to drop this guy after it. To me it seems like a last hooray for them before she moves on. Either that or a serious rekindling. 

If this guy‚Äôs gone for good, I‚Äôd be happy to pursue her more seriously, but it‚Äôs a weird situation and I‚Äôm clueless in what to do here. Do I just let this play out? Do I pull back a bit, stop messaging and hanging out with her? Keep things going at the same casual pace? Pursue harder?",dating_advice

t3_dku48m,"(26/M) Back on the dating scene again, but it feels tougher than ever","After one hell of a whirlwind of a relationship, I've put myself back on the market after 4 months of single-hood. Until I started putting myself out there again, I didn't really realize how many bad habits and thoughts are still with me from this relationship. Until you've been in a toxic relationship where you're constantly doubting your partners love and commitment for you, it's really hard to describe the pain of feeling like someone fundamentally changed who you are. The feelings of love are gone, but it seems the feelings about myself have remained. In short, I've lost my Mojo.  


   I've been doing the Tinder and Bumble thing, and I've been getting matches. I matched with a really sweet girl and we've been talking on and off for the past few days. Tinder and Bumble is so distracting for me though, so I've been planning to just freeze my accounts and delete the app. I told her I didn't want to lose contact, and would love to meet up. She agreed and gave me her number, great! I sent her a short text saying it was me, but haven't gotten a response yet. To be honest, its not really something worth responding too, but it is courteous to at least say ""Hi"" back.   


&amp;#x200B;

It's been well over a day since her and I last chatted. It's not like our conversations were so deep that I feel ""OOH THIS IS THE ONE FELLAS"", but I'm sure you all can agree with me that nobody wants to go out on a limb and feel like they're hung up to dry. This is where this gets tough for me....  
  


Throughout my last relationship I was always fighting for my ex's attention. Feeling like you're getting ghosted by the person who you think you are in love with is quite literally one of the most painful and distracting experiences of all time. I thought I worked through these insecurities, but they seem to be rearing their head back at me now that I have to put myself out there again.   


I should be able to just send a text to get a conversation going, but I cant get myself to do it. I dont want to come off as needy or pushy because in my heart I'm neither of those things. There seem to be so many rules like ""no double texting, wait at least 24-72 hours before texting them""... things that I honestly dont really agree with. It's definitely a symptomn of the informal nature of meeting online, women have to endure some legitimate freaks on these apps.  I'm not fixated on the person, so much as I am angry that I feel this way and just want it to be easy for me again. I enjoy the chase, I really do, but I feel like the rules have changed, for me at least. It's not like my life depends on getting this persons attention. But here I am posting to this (albeit wonderful) subreddit in hopes that people have experienced similar things after some substantial emotional abuse.   


Is it better to just take the plunge, do things that are uncomfortable, and fail if I have to?  Is that really what it takes to get the confidence going again? I know I'm not the only one here that has had to rebuild after a bad relationship.

I've often gone for weeks at a time going between work, solitary hobbies, and seeing the same friends and family members in between. Those things are about as conducive to getting dates as taking a job as a lighthouse keeper on Pitcairn Island. I've used Tinder, but that's seldom a serious avenue - it's just desultory entertainment. The one real place I meet new people is at a multilingual social event, and unsurprisingly, that is where I have gotten most of my dates in the past.

For the past 2 years, it's felt like I've had a giant cloud over my head. Girls are aggressive &amp; ignorant. There's been times I've messed up. Maybe something I've said or action that wasn't taken. Always trying to improve.
Long story short, I was at the airport Friday, asked to sit next to this younger girl &amp; friends(18?) because there was no where else to sit. I had no intentions of hitting on them.  Well she &amp; her friends all gave dirty looks to each other the entire time I was sitting there. Their gate moved, got up and the one friend joked to me about a disgusting piece of candy under the seat. I joked back and said have a good time ladies. That's when one of them said back quietly ""and you'll never see us again"". It all happened so fast that I let it go..
Yesterday i started snapchatting this girl I had been messaging on bumble. We went back and forth some and then there was a snap she never read. Well today I snapped something funny to her and come to find out she deleted me. Just says ""pending"". 
Had another girl a few days ago just ghost me. After a message or two she responded and said she had found a boyfriend and wasn't talking to anyone anymore. Completely lead me on.

I feel like it's something that happens with a full moon? But it's always happening? I'd rate my looks at an 7.75/10. Socializing can be tough but my confidence is there. I feel like I'm the only one that can help me but I've tried everything.

She was a very codependent person and over time, I became codependent too. We were forced to be apart over the summer due to circumstances out of our control, and over those two months, she gained a newfound sense of independence. In the first few months of us being reunited, I didn't understand this and thought she had lost interest in me and was avoiding me. Two weeks ago we had a conversation where she revealed that she does still love and care for me but doesn't miss me when we are apart anymore. She admitted she thought it was best for us to break up so we did, but she called me 20 min later and begged to pick me up in her car and asked that we try working through this/not break up. Confused and still in love I agreed.

t3_dkthow,The Waiting Game is Annoying,"Waiting for someone to come into your life that is compatible is really annoying. I got out of a short 3 month relationship (though he was in another country for half of it, so it was long distance), and previously was in a year relationship, and its annoying the process of dating again and finding someone that you mesh with well. I'm only in my early 20s, and I know that life doesn't revolve around finding a relationship, its just discouraging when those around you are in long term relationships with minimal drama, compared to mine when both of them winded up being massively incompatible with me. The first one we  weren't compatible emotionally, or lifestyle wise because I was in school, and he had no desire to start college and works part time, in addition every little difference would lead into a disagreement. The second one wanted to be a dj, so he would go downtown to clubs multiple times a week when I don't party or drink, and when we were hanging out he would just play video games for the vast majority of the time, and had a higher drive than me (wanting to do it multiple times a day, everyday). I tried to do online dating for a couple of weeks. I didn't have any trouble getting matches, but I felt as if everyone there wanted just instant gratification and flings, and since I go to a relatively large university I would feel embarrassed because I would either see people I recognized on the app, and would feel insecure like people recognized me on the app. Since the last one ended I haven't  talked to a guy but I feel like I'm ready to talk to someone new, and see where things go.

I (22M) have been talking to this girl (22F) for like 2 and a half months. I live in the US of A and she in England. We've known each other for a few years but I kinda just decided to try it and see what happens, making my intentions clear, and I think she knows that.

Living in different time zones 6 hours apart makes it kinda hard to talk often, given work and sleep, but overall I *think* its been going good. We talk basically daily, and usually on our days off try to make time to talk to each other, sometimes brief. And I don't think anything bad is happening as far as I'm aware.

But, I'm really really bad at this stuff, and I'll say I'm not that confident. I'm a pretty mature, level-headed fellow, except for things like this. I know she's usually shyish and quiet, and will give 1 word answers a lot. But I also have trouble making conversation because I don't want to say anything stupid or mess anything up of the sorts. I'm definitely trying hard. Maybe too hard. Sometimes I worry I'm not doing enough and try to be more creative and thoughtful with conversation, usually when its 1 word responses. Other times, I'm worried I'm talking too much and try to talk less and be short with answers and such. And I never know if I'm being annoying with it, any of it.

This isn't normal behavior or anything, right? Is there anything more I can do? Am I just looking to much into it??

We started talking about something and she told me that she was talking to another guy and that they went out, but he doesn't take it seriously and he never asked her to be his gf. I pretty much saw this as ""friendzone time!"", but I mustered the courage to simply tell her that I think she's pretty and I just want to get to know her more. I told her it's no worry if she doesn't feel the same way because we'd still be friends (I meant that) She told me ""honestly, I don't even know right now because I'm so confused, but for right now can we be friends"" My brain read that as ""You're a nice guy so I'm going to let you down gently"" and I told her that she didn't have to do that, but she said that she meant what she told me.

What the hell does that mean? Is she not sure if she wants to date me? Is she just leading me on? Is she hung up on the other guy, but she likes me? Or is it just a friendzone? I'm way beyond confused and I'm just wondering if any of you wonderful people can help me out.

My friend started introducing me to her group of friends. One guy in particular (43M) is also divorced , we actually had our paperwork done on the same day coincidentally. He has also not dated. And he is shy when sober. I know he used to be interested in one of our other friends but didn‚Äôt really pursue it and she‚Äôs now dating someone else. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs now interested in me so here are some events.

From the very first time we all hung out he has texted me to make sure I got home ok. I know he doesn‚Äôt do this to others. The third time we all hung out he texted me the next morning to see if I wanted to go do something with him. I declined because I had work to do. The next time we all hung out he invited me to meet him before hand for a drink. Again, I couldn‚Äôt. I realize this makes me seem uninterested.

A few weeks ago we all went out for a birthday. We went to see a live cover band and at some point he grabbed my hand and waist and we danced but he had a lot to drink at that point. We danced for a long while. We like the same music - hes 10 years older and was surprised I like the same music as him. We were the last two that stayed and we waited together for our separate ubers. At this point I thought he was interested but he then made reference to me going home to city A (where the other girl he used to be interested in lives). At that point I realized he was probably just thinking of her. When his Uber arrived he gave me a long hug and a kiss on the cheek. Went to the Uber and then came back out and ran to give me a kiss on the cheek and on my hand. He texted me later to make sure I got home ok.

This past weekend we all went to a party. He was very friendly and flirty (but also was drinking) and he called me hot in front of other people. And then he called me beautiful later on again in front of people. He also brought something up in conversation that I told him months ago over text that I presumed he had forgotten and he said yesterday how cool it was. When I went to leave he begged me to stay but I had to go. He again kissed me twice on the cheek both times I felt like he was going in for a real kiss but didn‚Äôt. He texted me even though he was pretty drunk to make sure I got home ok and then we chatted a little bit before going to bed.

His ex wife really affected him by cheating on him and using him for money. I think he‚Äôs still hurting. Another part is that his ex wife was hot. Like supermodel.

t3_dksews,Girls that 'like' me are largely bad at texting; girls that seem to be platonic aren't? Not sure if I just put too much thought into texting habits or if there's something else.,"I'm 23 if it matters.

So over a year ago I was getting to know a girl and was really bad at texting. It was a mixture of being scared but also being aloof. I'd already been intimate with this girl and she said how much she'd like me previously, but ended up backing away - saying she always had to initiate texting with me, and that I made her feel unwanted.

So since then I've made more of an effort to putting something into making the girl feel wanted. Y'know, messaging them every 2/3 days at least. But it's weird, because I've started to notice that the girls I'm meant to have a romantic spark with notably hang back. Since last year:

Girl 1 - we got talking one day. She admitted she thought I wouldn't message her and she thought I was very cute. We had good conversations for a few days, but then they tailed off. She'd give me the old ""sorry for the late reply"" messages for 3 days out of 4 at one point, so I stopped reaching out and we didn't speak again.

Girl 2 - girl I met abroad. At first she was very upbeat and happy. Once I was home she said she liked me, sent me good morning and goodnight messages even when I was already asleep myself, and said she wanted to meet up with me again a lot. Then her replies were mixed and more robotic for a couple of days, so I didn't reach out to give her space. Haven't heard from her since.

Girl 3 - a girl I really hit it off with. We flirted a lot and she said I was ""so handsome"". We got on well, and she hinted at being my girlfriend. One day she left me on read when I asked how her day was. Again I thought there was a reason so I let her reach out. Again, I haven't heard from her for a month now.

Girl 4 - most recent girl I'm still talking to. Met at a gaming event and got on really well. She then liked my photos on Facebook. I wondered if that was a hint but she didn't message me over it. After a couple of days I messaged her and we admitted we were attracted to each other. We've had good conversations and she's genuinely interesting too. But I'm feeling insecure again because I've reached out every time. I haven't spoke to her for 2 days and I just feel like I'm going to have to keep this alive again.

All of these situations feel strange, and even more so compared to how easy it is with a friend of mine. As far as I know there's no romantic interest. She did call me cute ages ago, but aside from that she's mostly only ever joked about us being Cupids for each other to help the other get a SO, or talked about her exs.

The thing is with her it's easy. She initiates with me 60% of the time, I initiate the rest. We joke around, have comfortable chats and serious chats. We talk most days and that's that. It feels good that she initiates too, and yet she's the only girl of the ones mentioned in this post that there seems to be no romantic spark involved.

It's weird, because the one girl who I had a romantic connection with that always initiated with me was the girl at the top of my post who told me in the first that I'm awful at texting and it made her feel unwanted. I tried to change my ways to make any future girls feel reassured, and yet now I'm the one who feels wanting from the other side. I just can't tell if these girls are shy and scared (like I was) and like when a guy initiates, or if they're largely happy that I got the hint and stopped talking to them.

So I need to know: am I potentially throwing away some of these connections too easily? Do most girls want the guy to initiate most times, and I shouldn't overanalyse who initiates? Or am I making the right call in backing off? I liked all of these girls but I do like to feel wanted too, so that's why I kind of back off if they become aloof or busy themselves. I'm not sure if I should just continue to message them when I am getting to know them, or if I'm right to not 'waste my time' if somebody isn't reaching out much themselves.

I want to end it with him because I've recently realized I'm shallow and I'm actually a terrible person üò£. The problem is his looks and I feel really bad for saying that because he's nice and we get along very well. But, I'm not physically attracted to him. 

We both knew our situation was short term since he's only in my city for work and he's moving back to his state in a couple months. I'm planning to end it with him but I don't know how to do that without seeming like a huge asshole. So, I don't want to tell him the real reason because I know it would hurt his feelings...

t3_dkuz3a,my (21F) boyfriend (20M) has anger issues that really affect our relationship,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 4 years. We dated years ago and fell in love, broke up after 3 years and decided to take a go at it again recently. We've both matured in our time apart and have realized our faults. Although recently, I have been feeling like I am being taken for granted by him. He gets mad over the smallest things and when one thing rubs him the wrong way, he calls me ""dramatic"" or ""emotionally unstable"" or ""stupid."" We had a serious talk recently about avoiding calling each other names so that we can work on having a healthier relationship.

I'm not perfect, but I do try my best to keep an open mind and always put myself in his shoes so I can empathize. I'm just here posting this right now because we recently argued two nights in a row from very very small things. To be more specific, today I went into work (at a very busy, but small restaurant) and I have bronchitis and sorry if TMI but it is also that time of the month for me. Today was just a shit show at work and I ended up getting real woozy and nauseous after. I am prone to anxiety and with my sickness and just overall tiredness after work, I guess my body wanted to shut down - I almost fainted on my way back home. My mom almost took me to the ER room. I tell my boyfriend that, just as an update as he is my best friend, and then told him that I'm safe now and getting ready for bed. He calls me a little later in the night and just rambles on about foreign news that his friend sent him. I got a little upset and asked him if he read what I sent to him - my tone may have had a bit of attitude in it because I was so excited to talk to him and he just completely disregarded how sick I was...he took what I said and asked me why I was being so ""dramatic"" and then he hung up on me. I ended up apologizing and sending him a string of texts as to why I got upset. He responded with calling me stupid and to think twice before I say things. He said he doesn't want to talk to me and when I told him I feel like he doesn't care, he says he's going to bed and ignores me.

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting but this is a common occurrence -- I say one thing that rubs him the wrong way and he resorts to name calling and making me feel bad about myself. He yells at me if I start to cry - he says it's just one of my ""tricks"" to make him feel guilty. He called me emotionally unstable yesterday and a bad person. I always ask him why he is with me if he truly thinks of me like that. He never has a response. 

We are very close, very intimate, and I'm scared we won't ever get out of these toxic habits. He once got really upset when he realized that he can't control his anger and it ends up hurting me and affecting both of us. He even brought up getting help with anger management. His anger is worse than ever recently and he always (and I mean it when I say always) realizes it AFTER I've gotten upset, after I try to talk to him in a very sympathetic manner trying to get him to understand, after telling him how I feel and how I also understand where he is coming from. Half the time we argue, I apologize just so he can calm down when he should be the one apologizing. I'm a pretty sensitive person and all my close friends and family know that. He can be a very insensitive person sometimes and has no idea how much he hurts me. I don't know how to get through to him. The more I hold back and swallow, the worse it gets. The more I talk about how I feel and try to work on things, for the both of us, he never wants to hear it. I love him so so so much and I know he loves me too, but I don't know why he reacts in such mean ways to me.",dating_advice
t3_dkqoyd,"Saw her with another guy in between the first date and the second, wondering what to do","So I‚Äôm at uni, and a little while ago I got talking to this girl from my building. Bumped into each other a couple times in person, then I started texting her a bit and we eventually went to a bar for drinks. 

The next day I messaged to say I had a good time, and asked if she‚Äôd like to do something else soon. She responded that she would like to, but not until her upcoming exams were over. Of course this seemed reasonable to me, so we agreed that we‚Äôd arrange something after that.

Those texts were a couple of weeks ago, and we haven‚Äôt spoken very much in the meantime. The exams are next week, so I planned to message her again after that. However, yesterday when I was coming home, I passed her with another guy just outside the building we live. They were talking quite seriously and it seemed like they were about to go somewhere. I think she saw me walk past too, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure about that.

Now I know it shouldn‚Äôt be a shock to see her with a guy, but it made me wonder about their situation, and whether she said the thing about wanting to see me again after exams as a way of letting me down gently, in the hope that over time things would die out. Anyway at this point my question is, should I interact with her as normal and just message next week like I‚Äôd seen nothing? Or should I address the situation and ask about the other guy? Or, does she not want to see me and therefore it would be best not to message at all?",dating_advice
t3_dksazi,I met this guy online...,"So I've been talking to this guy for almost 2 months now and I really like him and I know he likes me because he has addressed it to multiple times... I have aswell. We text and talk over the phone all day everyday and he has surprised me by showing up to my apartment a couple of times already. The first time we met, I was on my monthly and I was in so much pain and he literally stayed the whole night and bought me food. And the second time we went on a date to the movies and out to eat.  We've talked about being in a relationship but a couple of weeks ago, he told me about just being friends because he knows I've been through alot with being raped earlier this year having a miscarriage, being in the hospital and so on. He told me that he wants to be friends because he knows I've been through a lot but he wants to help me get back to who I use to be before I was raped. He even told me that I was not ready for a relationship. However we still talk every single day, multiple times a day, all day. I really like this guy and he makes my heart smile. Even today he showed up at my door and he knows I've been sick since earlier this week and he knows that... and him surprising me is just different.

t3_dkuwkd,"Guys, how strange is it that I‚Äôve never dated or been on a date? Would u not want to go on a date with me due to this?20F","Hello, everyone!! I‚Äôve been worrying about this for a while now and would really appreciate some feedback. I‚Äôm gonna give some background on my situation‚Äî

I went to a small private school for 9 years, and the only people who were deemed as ‚Äúcool‚Äù and ‚Äúdatable‚Äù had to be super sporty, which I was not. (I was the artsy kid.)  I became awkward/withdrawn for a while due to this, but this has not been the case for a while now. Most of the boys (and most of the girls) were very rude and snooty (they were literally like the private school kids u see in the movies lol) so I kinda gave up on dating in high-school. In fact, I‚Äôm not close to any guys other than my brother and dad. 

My dad is also always telling me that guys at my age usually just want girls for their body so that‚Äôs obviously scared the crap out of me because I want to be respected. (Please, please someone tell me most guys don‚Äôt think this way. I‚Äôm genuinely upset at this.) I‚Äôm extraverted and I know I‚Äôm very good looking even if I don‚Äôt always feel like it. I don‚Äôt look like it at all but I‚Äôm a hella dork (I own Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and Spiderman T-shirts kind of dork) and now I‚Äôm considered ‚Äúinnocent for my age‚Äù and it makes me think that any guy I‚Äôm attracted to wouldnt like that. I drunk kissed a guy at a party but that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever done, and I feel like a lot of guys would be really weirded out by my inexperience.

All of my friends met their boyfriends in very different ways, so I know there‚Äôs no one way to go about it. But I would really like to date‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôm really missing out on an important aspect of life, but I don‚Äôt know how to go about this. I‚Äôm worried that guys will think there‚Äôs something wrong with me since I‚Äôm so inexperienced. Would this put most guys off??

t3_dkur67,Does she like me? I totally like her btw.,"I work at a small IT firm and there's this female colleague of mine, who is the same age as me and who I think likes me. There's a few reasons why I think that..

* She seems to be really interested in what I have for lunch.
* I'm quite new in the company so we don't know each other that well but while playing cards she stands besides me more often than not. On one occasion I thought she was trying to lean towards me and was standing really close to me (her hair was touching my shoulder) even when there was space on the other side.
* The other day she'd made some pizza. Everyone was supposed to get two slices. While I was still having the first slice she offered me a second slice saying I hadn't taken my second slice yet. No big deal I would usually say, but the fact that she offered it to me and no one else makes me wonder.
* I usually don't sit close to her while working but a couple days ago I had to sit at the desk adjacent to hers for certain reasons. During the day her hand brushed against mine quite a few times. I also asked her to plug my laptop charger into the power socket and while handing over the plug she touched my hand in a way that I felt wasn't necessary (although I liked it), almost as if she was trying to feel my hand.

t3_dkuqfd,21 Confused,"So in early 2019 I started talking to this girl I know through my cousin. She is cute, smart, funny, I like her. We got pretty close and I flirted with her a lot and we talked every night.  But then she got cold suddenly. I told her how I felt and then she said she couldn‚Äôt do a relationship but wanted to remain friends. So we went on being friends and all was fine. We hung out, joked around etc. Recently after a month of low contact she said she missed me and I went and visited her at college which is like 40 minutes away. Seemed to go well but now she is cold again. I treat her strictly as a friend and did so in person too. No flirting, no clingyness, kind of aloof over text/snap. I Don‚Äôt push romantically with her so why is she backing away? I know the first time around she didn‚Äôt want that and maybe I was pushing too hard so I‚Äôm not flirting or being romantic but it‚Äôs not working. She‚Äôs still acting like I‚Äôm in love with her or something. I do care about her and like her as more than a friend for sure, but I won‚Äôt let that ruin our friendship because I like her as a person too. So I overpower those feelings and bury them. 

I guess I‚Äôm venting because it hurts when someone you like like this isn‚Äôt right with you. I asked what was wrong and she said nothing. Ah well I‚Äôm confused. Why would she be acting like this suddenly? She did this once before when we had a date setup, got cold and then came back around. But it‚Äôs been a few weeks now.",dating_advice

t3_dkq6ow,guy who previously rejected me now wants to date me now i have lost weight,"I matched with a guy on a dating app last year. He was only in the city for a week and we couldn't arrange a time to suit us both to meet up for a date. I thought we would lose touch but we ended up staying in contact the entire time he was away (he was overseas for work). We talked almost everyday for 8 months!

During these 8 months, I dropped from 250lbs to 180lbs (I am 5'3). I told him about my weight and how I was working on improving myself and he said that my weight didn't bother him. I was a little concerned however because he is a super fit guy. He goes to the gym almost everyday and is generally very athletic. I would also like to note that during this time we never talked about what we were looking for but it was heavily implied on his side that we would date and perhaps even end up in a relationship. He would say things like ""when we are dating"" etc.

So 8 months pass and we finally meet up. I must admit despite losing 70lbs, I was still very insecure! I was still overweight and unhappy in my body. He was very nice but way too pushy sexually... I was genuinely surprised but thought maybe it was because of the long wait. We met another few times and it was all very 'sex focused'. However, I refused to get completely naked during sex and was obviously uncomfortable with him touching me in certain places. I understand this is an unattractive trait but I couldn't control it. Anyway, he then starts acting differently... I started hearing from him less and less and seen that he was back on dating apps. We then didn't speak for a month or so and he suddenly reappears and asks to meet up again. We meet and... you guessed it, sex! I was very naive and thought we were going to start dating properly but whenever I asked 'what we were', he told me that he was seeing other people and he doesn't think I can handle that and disappeared once again.

So, fast forward another 4 months... I am now down to 130lbs! I went HARD in the gym and I am finally comfortable in my  own skin - very minimal loose skin too which is surprising. He sees a picture of me and reaches out and has now asked to take me out to dinner. Before this we only ever met up at his place or mine (apart from our first date).

I understand how important attraction is so I am not faulting him but it just stings a little to know he is taking me more seriously now that I look better? Am I being unreasonable? I genuinely liked him but I was way too insecure at the time to be with anybody but I also don't want to make the same mistake twice as part of me feels like he used me. Should I just move on or give it one last shot?",dating_advice
t3_dki65y,Can trying to look too good hurt your attractiveness and approachability? Really need your opinions on this one.,"Tl;Dr at the bottom

Hello everyone, I got this strange idea while chilling in a club. I (22M) was drinking beer and talking with quite drunk woman (35-40) about life, careers etc. Not like we had attraction, more like the usual drunk bar talks. After talking for some time, she just hits me with a phrase: ""I think that girls *never* approach and talk to you. You look really good, but I think they never will"" (She was right).

When I asked her to explain why, she told me that I try to look too good, to be ""bigger than world"". I'm almost 2 meters in height, slim but with wide muscular shoulders, and I think my dressing style is definitely above average. She confirmed that I dress and groom really nice, and that I'm a confident guy who always wants to be in control of a situation. Everything else like my posture, body language, manners etc. were also very good in her opinion. She also mentioned that my face/emotions/voice control and ability to stay calm and focused were perfect.

But all this made me unapproachable, not real, not genuine. I've noticed that I get quite a lot looks from girls when I go out, and when I dance with friends, dancing girls start ""spawning around"". But I actually was never approached by any of them. Also, when I approach strangers (both M and F) in club settings, they usually take a submissive stance in a dialogue.

And now I'm really lost, as I see how her ideas can be both right and wrong. I would love to hear your opinions and advices on this matter, from both girls and guys perspectives.

Tl;Dr: an older drunk woman told me that I look and act really good, but girls will never approach or talk to me. It's because I have become ""not genuine and not my real self"" due to trying to look and act perfectly.",dating_advice

t3_dku1tt,How to re-establish her interest?,"So to start off I‚Äôve known this girl for a while. We started texting and talking a lot due to us having a class together so things kinda just worked out. She used to respond to me within minutes, but now she takes forever. Her responses are also much more brief than they were previously, and to add to that if I text her and she wakes up the next morning and sees it she won‚Äôt keep it going.

I had a convo with her in person not to long ago where she made it sound made it sound like she wanted me to text her back although she was being dry af texting like 3 word responses. When she does this I usually just leave her on read as I feel she just doesn‚Äôt want to talk. Idk if she wants me to put in more work and try to keep the convo going, but I also don‚Äôt want to be pushy and annoying. 

Perhaps the reason she has stopped responding quickly is because I don‚Äôt keep the conversation going and she thinks I‚Äôm the dry texter?

Although this is pretty childish We keep a streak together and Ik for a fact she doesn‚Äôt do streaks. I used to reply to her streak and start a convo but I felt I was doing that to much so I backed off. Ever since she has pretty much stopped sending streaks. But where I get hella confused is that when I do start a convo after a streak is sent she texts short ass responses that make it hard to keep the convo going. 

Is this girl just attention seeking? When we talk in person she flirts a little I think and she is super into our convo always laughing and making very strong eye contact. But has also called me bro a few times. Every time she does this I make an effort to stop the conversation so she gets the point but she doesn‚Äôt seem to care and continues to call me that.

t3_dkqs6n,High school dating help,"There's a girl in my class who I really like. She's cute, smart and, just like me, pretty quiet.

There was really no point in me trying to date before reaching high school, so I really want to start. I've devised myself a plan to win her over. 

Now, i'm not what you would call social butterfly. I'm more of a social anvil-to-the-head: direct and straight. I usually despise long winded strategies with a moderately low chance of success, but this is my only chance, so I'm damn sure gonna make the most out of it. For for a few days, I just talked to her from time to time, making sure to not overwhelm her, say the right things, joke a bit etc. and she seemed perfectly okay with that.

After this overly long intro, I finally get to my real problem: One day I decided to text her. My plans were to ask her out on like a ""pseudo-date"" (not actually romantic, but a bit of flirting thrown in there. Of course, i wasn't gonna tell her this). Just like the anvil I mentioned before, my entire system was shattered my the dreaded blue check marks. Madafakin seen after i just said ""Hey, what's up?"". That's it. No other messages.

Could someone help me understand, why? What did I do? I didn't make her mad in any way and she couldn't have known what I wanted to say. After like 2 days, i messaged her again, asking something about the physics homework, so totally unrelated to dating. I didn't actually need it. I just wanted to see if this time she says anything; but no. Seen again.

So, reddit, does she just hate me; have I done something bad; or is it something else?

Tl;dr: Girl leaves me on seen for no apparent reason.

I cannot for the life of me flirt/pull a girl, I used to be good when I was a teen but I went through a rough year where I didn't socialise with anyone from my age group, I had a rough time learning how to socialise again once I got to uni. In this transition I've gone through a huge personality change but I now get very anxious when approaching girls/approached by girls in clubs and bars. It's so bad that when I match someone on tinder I instantly close the app and try to pretend it didn't happen, my nerves get the better of me and I'll unmatch them.

So one day, I told her that since we are both doing the exercises for a class, we should exchange numbers so that we can ask each other questions if we are stuck on something. So she gave me her number, and also said that ""I would also love to study together but I am really busy these days"". Then we talked a bit more about some irrelevant thing, and she says the same thing again, without me saying anything involving us meeting. Then we talked a bit more, and as i was leaving she said something like ""looking forward to see you next week at class"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that when a girl says she is too busy, and doesn't provide an alternative, it probably means that she is not interested. But this time it was her that brought up meeting together, and it was her that brought it up again, completely unprompted. So what does that mean? Should I bring it up again next week?

 I've only ever had one girlfriend, and that disaster of a relationship is a factor that caused me to slip into the depression that caused me to gain weight most recently last year. It's fucking hard. I've gone down to 150 at 5'5 right now. Maybe low 20's bf? I have no abs but no hanging stomach and I seem reasonably fit when I'm wearing a shirt that fits me. 

But the combination of larger than average chest muscles and chubby cheeks make me seem chubby wearing a winter coat and shirts thst are too tight make me feel super self conscious about my small belly pouch. I don't really get any matches on tinder, and I've been rejected so much I literally can't stand looking at my body. 

And now I just tore my hamstring rock climbing(Relatively minor tear though thank God) so none of that for at least 3-4 weeks so I am absolutely terrified of gaining weight again. I've cut down my calories a lot to try and maintain a deficit but I'm very afraid of losing control since I have a large appetite from being active. I've had too much anxiety in the last little bit to ask anyone out or try to pursue dating so I'm wondering if I should even bother before I can cut down and get my abs back.

This is the first time I have asked a girl out.

So I met this girl at a nightclub. She was there with a friend and I asked if I could buy her a drink. She seems a bit shy and I asked her if she wanted to go outside to talk. We talked for 15 minutes and she seemed interested in me.

 However she went back inside because it was cold and I needed to go to the toilet. I went to go and find her but couldn't as she went home as she was tired. It was her first night out and didn't have much to drink which is probably why.

The next day I texted her a bit about college and that was it. A couple days later after texting her I decided to ask her out. 

However this was probably a bit too early and she didn't reply as I'm shit at communicating over text. Now I'm going to wait another day before texting her.

I left at 3 am as she was yawning but she kept trying to keep the convo going so I obviously did not want to overstay my welcome.

(Background story; we met at work, I asked her to hang out, which we did, but she didnt realise it was a date. So when I asked her out a second time, she then realised and told me that shes not looking for a relationship at the moment as she will be leaving the country soon, but also said she just wanted to make aware of the situation and would not mind going out and meeting me again).

A few weeks ago, he turned around and said ""OP, I like you"" to which I panicked. I honestly have no idea how one is supposed to react to that.

But she kind of dropped that cute lingo recently too, yet we still see each other, we hold hands, try to be as romantic as possible with what she gives me, although sometimes I feel that she is holding back.

I am so confused, and it is starting to mess up with my head because part of me thinks she actually does like me - we can get so passionate talking about our fields (Same career), she always says Im funny and I can make her laugh, and we spend quality time together. But part of me is getting frustrated with the lack of sexuality in this relationship, and starting to make me feel I am not more to her... She always says ""We're more than friends"".

I was at a bar last night, all by myself where I started talking to this cute girl next to me, It was around midnight, and we were really getting to know each other. Surprisingly it was her birthday today so I bought her a drink and we were really enjoying each other's company. I found out she had just turned 29 and she is a visiting scholar from Europe. So we exchanged numbers while at the bar and she sent me her address saying that she is hosting a brunch at 11am tomorrow and I should definitely join her. It got really late around 1:30 am and we were asked to leave the bar (after last call) and we could have easily chatted for 2-3 more hours and she was getting really comfortable telling me about her past relationships and stuff. In the end we hugged and bid farewell and she told me if I cannot make it to her brunch, we should definitely get coffee together.

This morning I could not make up my mind whether I should go to her brunch because I am a little socially awkward and have trouble interacting with a large number of people (I am smooth af in one on one conversations). Also it owuld be so weird to introduce myself as the guy who met her last night. But then I thought, fuck it! Lets move out of my comfort zone and I texted her that I will be a little late. She was happy to see me at her brunch but I felt super awkward when she told her friends ""This is XYZ, I met him at a bar last night (started giggling) and we had really great things to talk about."" I was silent through most of the brunch and might have come off as dull to her and her friends. One of her friends even pulled my legs saying ""You are a much better match for her than her ex-boyfriend"" and she said ""Hello! Do I not have a say in this."" All in all it was a shit job, and I really feel I made a fool out of myself by going there. Then when I was leaving she hugged me again and said ""I am really impressed you were brave enough to come here"". Does it imply she wasn't expecting me?

So yesterday I made a post asking if the fact that my crush \[18F\] invited me to go to the movies with her and her best friend \[18F\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dk4xw2/my\_crush\_18f\_invited\_me\_18m\_to\_go\_to\_the\_movies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dk4xw2/my_crush_18f_invited_me_18m_to_go_to_the_movies/), and I got a lot good and helpful replies from that, so first of all thank you so much if you contributed to that post yesterday. Some of the replies made me wonder though, if she is actually just as confused with my intentions with her as she is with mine, which complicates the whole thing even more. It just sort of turned everything around, from thinking before that she might just not be interested in me to now, realizing I may have made my intentions unclear and therefore difficult for her to know how to act. 

So when she ""invited"" me to go to the movies the text we wrote back and forth were the following (not exactly but pretty close):

&amp;#x200B;

Me: You don't have time to do anything this vacation haha

Crush: No I know it's so annoying. I haven't even had time to watch this movie and irritates me so much. 

Me: Same! I really want to go see it too!

Crush: I only have time next friday, that's the only time in two weeks!

Me: I really have to figure out a way to watch that movie though.

Crush: Yeah, we could go watch it next friday, I think ..... wants to watch it too. We could make a little trip out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does it seem as if she wants me to take action and ask her out or am I just imagining this because I have a crush on her?

Also, if that's the case it would seem to her that I'm not romantically interested in her, right?, which is totally not true. Should I ask her if she wanted me to take action or just leave it at that?

No matter how hard I try I am really cold and distant even though I'm interested in her. I shrug off conversations and my replies are short and disinterested. My ex pointed this out to me. Even after we had been dating for a couple months she pointed out that around my friends I was loud, laughing, super outgoing, but as soon as it was just us i shut down and barely talked. I initially chalked it up to nerves but it persisted months into the relationship and it's happened every time I've become interested in a girl since. And I've noticed it's only if I'm trying to start a relationship, not just a hookup. Any advice would be much appreciated.",dating_advice
t3_dkngpw,"I'm into the same girl as my roommate, advice?","So my roommate started hanging out with a girl recently and seems to be quite into her, he doesn't seem to be a really obvious flirter but he is definitely putting on the moves. The issue is that I \[20M\] hung out with her a couple times to work on an assignment since we are in the same class. Fast forward a week and the three of us are at a party and she ends up consistently sitting next to me and making little touches and general signs that she might be into me too and has asked to hang out since. I don't get many dates so it pains me to throw away an opportunity for a date but I also don't want to be a colossal ass to my roommate since he is still into her and I would have never met her had he not started hanging out with her.

t3_dkpc37,Relationship history off-putting,"I feel like I have had a pretty normal relationship past for someone my age (33m). I have been in two long term relationships since I was 21,the first lasting 5 years for which I have a child from. The second was a 6 year relationship with being married for 4 of those years which ended in March this year (not yet divorced and won't be until next year). 
I don't bring up this topic myself but am always honest about my situation when asked. I've had a string of first dates where the women (all around my age) are really put off by this (One even said she wouldn't go out with me again because I've ever been married in the first place and another said after we had sex that she doesn't normally sleep with married men). 
I'm not sure how to explain my situation when asked without scaring someone off and feel that I am being punished for being in serious relationships before.
I don't think there is a right answer to this and maybe these women just found an easy excuse to not go on a second date? I just needed to vent really as it's starting to bum me out.",dating_advice
t3_dksbaa,Is it immoral/a lie to say a half true to your ex?,"So I (23) technically broke up with my ex (25) couple of months ago, before summer started. I wasn't sure of my feelings, we had a certain lack of communication when it came to conflicts solving and on top of that I started questioning my sexuality. We kept seeing each other during the summer (like 5 times) and we had sex on those occasions, mainly because I feel very secure around him. 

We still had this deal that we are not together and we are allowed to sleep with other people as required. He said he is not interested in meeting other people, but I knew I need to sleep with a woman before I even consider getting back with him, for clarity. I went for holidays, apparently we had a phone call after I came back, during which he asked me, in context, if I slept with a man during our time apart. I said that I didn't. I avoided the confession which would naturally follow up after that. The truth is that I did not sleep with a man, but I did sleep with a woman over the summer (we were still allowed, as we were both single). Am I being a prick for not following up with the information that I slept with a girl? Like I wasn't aware I am bisexual and I was really scared to admit that I slept with a girl over the phone. I told him about that later on, when we were about to have sex and I wasn't sure if I might require an STD test. I didn't want to accidentaly infect him with something,

Every time I try to date someone, it goes well at the start. We talk a bit, have a good time, maybe even go somewhere with a group of friends. 

So then, I try asking her out. One of two things happen:

- I am rejected, simply because she only thought of me as a friend.
- I am somehow not rejected, but then I find out she already has somebody.

t3_dkfx7n,I (F22) gave a guy (M20?) in my class my number and...?,"So there‚Äôs a guy in my college drawing class who I noticed looking at me about 3 weeks ago. He‚Äôd glance at me and when I would catch his eyes he‚Äôd look away. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first but he does it a few times every class. One day I could feel him staring at me pretty hard while i was drawing. I peaked back at him and he quickly looked away. He‚Äôs pretty quiet, I notice he slightly raises his hand like he wants to contribute to class discussions but he doesn‚Äôt speak up on his own like everyone else. He also doesn't go out of his way to talk to anyone in class (not even the one other quiet guy next to him) and prefers to draw in his personal sketchbook instead. I on the other hand am very vocal in class and have 3 really good friends in there who I talk to a lot. He‚Äôs very nice and thoughtful from the few times i‚Äôve gotten to talk to him or hear his contributions during critiques.  

I told myself the last time we had class together if I caught his eyes more than once by the end of class I‚Äôd give him my number. I did, so after class I wrote it down quickly and caught him in the hall to give it to him. Unfortunately I got nervous so all I could make out was ‚ÄúI catch you looking at me sometimes‚Äù while I handed it to him, to which he seemed surprised, looked at the paper and said ‚ÄúOh, I was looking at your art. You and [classmates] can get the charcoal really dark but I can‚Äôt seem to get mine to do that.‚Äù 

I told him you have to use a special kind of charcoal and he just nodded like he didn‚Äôt already know (prof. had already discussed it). I was pretty flustered at this point and just said ‚Äúwell, I saw you looking over, so there‚Äôs my number if you want to talk about art or anything sometime.‚Äù he said ‚Äúok! thanks‚Äù and I left so he could get going.

This was Thursday, and it‚Äôs now Saturday night and he hasn‚Äôt messaged. Was I wrong in thinking he was eyeing me? Or am I too impatient? He said he was looking at my charcoal drawings, but this started before we were doing charcoal, and when I‚Äôd look back at him our eyes would meet. He didn‚Äôt sound put off when I approached him, just surprised. 

I know it‚Äôs impossible to know exactly without talking to him, but I‚Äôm curious what others would do if you got a phone number from someone without asking, whether you‚Äôre interested in them or not. 

**TL;DR:** Noticed a guy in my drawing class has been stealing looks at me. Gave him my number to make the first move, he said he was looking at my drawings, not me. Didn‚Äôt seem put off to take my number but hasn‚Äôt messaged two days later. Thoughts?",dating_advice
t3_dks1ts,Inexperienced with dating and a little nervous (F19),"(I‚Äôm on mobile, sorry) To preface: I‚Äôve had one boyfriend before when I was in high school.

However, I‚Äôve been told our relationship wasn‚Äôt a normal one (it wasn‚Äôt) and now I‚Äôm really clueless when it comes to dating.

In a moment of weakness, I decided to download a dating app to try and get myself out there. I‚Äôm not looking for hookups or anything like that, I was/am looking for a relationship. I matched with a few people and specifically started talking to this one guy (M21). Right off the bat he texted me constantly with good morning and goodnight texts, calling me pretty, and asked what I was up to multiple times a day. Being with my first boyfriend, who barely texted me at all and didn‚Äôt acknowledge my presence that much, this new guy is a real 180 from what I‚Äôm used to. At first he seemed right up my alley, with interests and beliefs that lined up with mine, but as we‚Äôve been talking more, I find myself increasingly worried of what his intentions actually are, especially when he says ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for.‚Äù

We scheduled a date to go to his place to hang out. It seemed innocent enough at the time I agreed to it because I was so star struck that a guy seemed genuinely interested in me. As the day of the date gets closer, I‚Äôm worried that he thinks it‚Äôs going to be a hookup (especially because it‚Äôs planned to be at his place) which I am definitely not into at the moment! I‚Äôm not sure how to properly breach the subject matter because I don‚Äôt want to insult him by assuming that‚Äôs what he wants.

He kept messaging me everyday and he would say I was cute and yada yada. 
We were going to hang out Friday and I told him I got off work around 9:30 10:00 pm, then he said that was too late and that he was tired and what is there to do that late? And that he still wanted to hang another day. 
Then we message the next day and he wanted to watch the yankee game at his house last night and I said ok.

t3_dkrvg4,"Should I give this guy a chance? He asked me out, but I'm not sure.","Hi. I want to know what's your take on this. I'm a female,  28 y/o. This guy invite me on a date this week:

I met a guy through Facebook; from his pictures, he seemed cute. So we started chatting, and found out he have the same interests, hobbies and tastes. So that was pretty awesome, since in my country is really hard to find someone with those specific things (I mean, my interests, hobbies, etc)., so I thought that was reall great.

After some time, he asked for my number and I gave it to him, and he started to text me everyday (in a good way, not in an annoying way, lol) and I texted him too. We talked about everything, so eventually the conversation turned about sex, and it was good, however after that, everytime we talked he kept veering the conversation towards that theme and I found that dissapointing, and kinda annoying tbh. But I overlooked that because of all the other stuff. However the other day he told me that he would like if I give him a blow job, and I was like ""no way lol"", but he wasn't joking and he kept asking me, etc, but I just keep saying ""not happening"" and that was all. After that I felt awkward texting him, so I didn't. Days passed and he didn't either, but the other day he texted me and told me that he would like to get to know me better, and if I could go out with him (that was this past week), and I told him that I couldn't  because I was busy, that maybe this week (meaning, the week that starts tomorrow lol), but the truth is that I'm not so sure about him anymore. And he hasn't texted me since the day he asked me (like this past Wednesday) and me neither. But in case he asks again....

Here are some other ""red flags"", or at least I think, these are red flags, I'm not sure:

* He has a 9 months baby. The red flag about this is obviously, the baby mama. The baby is just 9 months and he's not with the mother anymore. He also has a 9 years old boy, with another woman.
* He told me that one of his vices was sex. And yeah, I didn't ask about it because I didn't take it seriously, but maybe I should have, since he asked me about the blow job and all...

That's all, but I would like to know what you think about this. Should I give him a chance?",dating_advice

t3_dkmowd,Should I [28F] give my ex [30M] who wasn't ready another chance?,"I first met this guy two years ago, like a month after he'd gotten out of an 8 year relationship and had been cheated on. We started dating not knowing how things would evolve, and it was incredible. We'd never met anyone like each other. We were best friends with chemistry and understood each other ways we've never felt before with previous partners. It just worked. But after a few months, it was abundantly clear that he wasn't ready for anything serious and so I ended things. I was looking for a relationship, and though it was obvious that the connection was there, I told him he needed to heal from the previous relationship, learn how to be on his own, and then to come find me when he was ready. I wanted to be a partner to him, but he wasn't ready to be a partner to anyone--he was depressed, needed to work on his mental health, and unsure if he wanted to move back home, whether to stay in his career or not. We both agreed it was for the best.

The break up doesn't really stick. We text a bit. Three months in, he tells me he misses me and wants to be together, we immediately start dating briefly again--but it's still very clear he's not ready for a relationship didn't work on his personal issues, though he is trying. Ultimately we break up again, and I am angry that he came back, put me through this again when I gave him the chance to work on himself. I tell him for his own sake, he should try therapy, and best of luck with his life. It hurt, but I moved forward, have been dating, and living a good life.

Well, about 10 months pass this time. He doesn't contact during this time per my request and now we've recently reconnected. He apologized profusely for what he has put me through in the past. He acknowledges that he shouldn't have come back last time, that he thought he was ready, but he wasn't. He hadn't done anything in those three months to heal or figure out his life. This time, in the past 10 months he has been going to therapy. He has been figure out a plan for himself, and getting back into a better headspace. He has given himself time to be on his own. He doesn't expect another chance and he doesn't want to rush in to things, like last time. He wants to take things slow, build back my trust, and build a relationship from there. He never wants to hurt me again and is so sorry for what happened previously. But the feelings are still there.

So now, I'm faced with the decision of whether or not to give this guy another chance. I'll be honest, I love him, I can still see a future with him, and I WANT to believe things will work this time. He is my favorite person in the world and the full package for me. But I don't want to be stupid and get my heartbroken again. Like I've said, I've dated around since we've broken up, met some nice guys, but no one I connected to as deeply or felt like the best version of myself, like I do around him. I'm not going to rush in to things or commit to him right away. But I'm faced with this dilemma, was it truly a case of bad timing or if we were so, so compatible, wouldn't we have worked the first time around?

t3_dkrbdq,Need some advice,"Hey all. I am 23M and I need some advice for my current situation. Here's some context. I matched with a girl I went to high school with on hinge in early September. We have known each other since we were in 6th grade. We were always good friends and I would say there's always been a little chemistry. Anyway, we matched and I sort of opened with a joke.  We get to talking and I decided to ask her out. She agrees and we go out. It was an awesome time but I don't personally consider it a date. We had an awesome conversation and it was great to see her, but it just felt different than a normal date. I will say she looked even more beautiful than I remembered her looking. This was around the second week of September. After that day, over a month went by and neither of us had reached out to each other. To be real, I wasn't even thinking about her since I have still been dating a couple of other women as well. She lives about an hour away so I didn't really feel like pursuing her either. That was until this past weekend. I was staying in town for the night and had nothing to do after what I had originally gone up there for. I decided to text her and tell her I was in town for the night, then I asked what she was up to. She texted me back within minutes suggesting we get together. So we did. I didn't have a car since I rode up with someone else. I let her know and she picked me up. We went to a bar that was close to my hotel. It was late, but I still had a great time, and I could tell she was enjoying it too. The conversation was awesome and I sensed a different vibe than the first time we had met. I didn't kiss her, or even make a move as I felt like that would be rushing it. Plus, I respect our long friendship and that kind of deterred me. This was on Thursday. She has been on my mind all weekend and I can't seem to shake it.

So to start off I‚Äôm 17 and literally never talked to a girl in my life (what I mean by that is I‚Äôve never even tried gaming on a girl before, obviously I‚Äôve asked girls to pick my pencil up etc.) 

I also started working my first job less than two weeks ago and i met this coworker who‚Äôs fine af. I took a shift that I normally don‚Äôt work to try and get cool with her some more. So anyway after our shift was over me her and two other (female) coworkers went out to eat and idk how, but me and this coworker were talking almost the entire time. I thought for sure i was gonna fuck it up but somehow I managed to keep talking to a girl for once in my life.

And after that all 4 of us went to a ice cream place near by and bought some shit and we sat there and talked for a while. And even after my other two coworkers left me and this girl talked for hella long, like over 40 min. She had to finally leave cuz her mom got so mad about not coming home that she drove by and called her, even tho she has her own car.

But then here‚Äôs the thing, i added her on snap, and it‚Äôs been two days and she still hasn‚Äôt added me back. Why wouldn‚Äôt she add me back? I feel like I‚Äôve been ghosted and i feel so shitty. I thought things were finally going good for once with a girl, but now I‚Äôm not being added for some reason? Wtf does this mean?? Did i not have a chance in the first place?

Some more info: when we went out to eat, she didn‚Äôt even buy anything to eat and didn‚Äôt buy any ice cream afterwards either. Also she called my hair pretty but I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs just tryna be friendly cuz it seems like she‚Äôs friendly in general.",dating_advice

For a few months I tried tinder, but after my self esteem got a few big hits due to never getting a like I kinda gave up. However, Im unsure if online dating is even a good idea. I know it works for a bunch of people, but Ive already heard many people say its unreliable. 

I grew up with very religious parents who met at a church, and seem to expect/hope I end up the same, but (havent told them yet, dont plan to till I can leave the state) that I dont agree with them completely, and dont want to just go to every church under the sun hoping I run into someone. Because of their background, I cant really ask about dating advice because neither of them had ever dated before they met each other anyway. 

I was under the impression for a while that I had to first be good friends with someone before I could date them, but I feel like in hindsight thats a bad idea as It puts the friend in an awkward spot, and I dont want to be ‚Äúthat friend.‚Äù 

Are there some Basics I should know above all else? Are there any tips you can give for initial impressions? I hope this wasnt too scatter brained, Im writing it during a break in work, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

The sobering fact was that I felt no attraction to her, and actually managed to forget her name about 2 hours in. I didn't get her number at all though I gave her mine when she asked. I don't think she's interested in me, but that's fine. 

What I am afraid of now is that after so many years living in a fog, I have lost the ability to be attracted to people. I don't think this is true, as I can identify characters in TV shows that I would love to be with for example, but it doesn't translate into real life. Attractive people do catch my gaze, but I haven't had a single crush in 6 years.

I'm quite lost in my head right now at what this all means, so it would be much appreciated if anyone here has any advice or suggestions. Thanks!",dating_advice
t3_dkr01h,How do I [20] deal with my crush [20] seeing someone else?,"Hey everyone, so there is this girl in some of my college classes and we are in the same lab group as each other. I had finally decided that I was going to see if she wanted to hang out/ask her out sometime here soon. This weekend though I had to do a project for that lab group and the girl I like couldn't show up. So her friend did (who is also in the lab group) and we completed the project. The problem is that her friend told me that the girl I like was going to do something with some guy and he was probably going to ask her out and she had no idea and that was why she couldn't show up to help on the project today. This was heartbreaking to me and has made me sick to my stomach. What should I do? I almost want to still try to pursue this but I think that might not end up well for me. Should I just wait till it runs its course and then see? I'm not sure and I look forward to that one boring class and lab everyweek just so I can see her. It is killing me and I need some advice.

t3_dkqxe5,"My toxic Ex wants me back, I can‚Äôt say no"," was a very toxic relationship that I finally got out of. I blocked him everywhere. Somehow he managed to call me. 

I answered, now I feel bad, anxious and depressed. 

I said I don‚Äôt want a relationship and it would never work with him. I am sorry. And I hope you get better, please find help.

Yet he still pleads, telling me how great we would be if we can make it work.

I told him I don‚Äôt want to be friends anymore. I feel like I can‚Äôt relate to him, he‚Äôs got attitude, and he makes me unhappy.

I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings and him to do anything stupid. So I agreed to let him phone me once a month but I feel a dark cloud over me has returned.

I felt so free and happy until he called.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to speak to him anymore. But it feels like I am trapped.

I blocked him one time, and he phoned me more than 40x and this was before one of my biggest exams, I didn‚Äôt need it. He is obsessed with what we had. It was the worst relationship I ever been in.

t3_dkqs2l,"if you have the time to read this, please do and give me advice if you have any","i started liking this guy 6 years ago and i can‚Äôt get over him (i‚Äôm 17). i told him i liked him when i was 11 and he told me he felt the same way and we dated for a year, then one of my friends told me that he said he liked another girl from outside of school so i broke up with him right away. When i told him that we needed to break up all he said was ‚Äúokay but just know that it isn‚Äôt true‚Äù. I have always felt that when i told him i liked him, he only said it back because he didn‚Äôt know what else to say, not because he actually liked me so when we broke up, i was talking to one of his friends and told him (about him not liking me from the beggining) so he said it is true. He said that he didn‚Äôt like me at the beggining but during that year we dated he actually liked me and was heartbroken when i left him. 2 months ago, i told his closest friend, which is also one of my closest friends and apparently he can sense that i still like him (the guy i like not his friend). I used to think that there might actually be hope that he still likes me because of the way he looks at me when he‚Äôs laughing and because i always catch him staring at me. But then he and my bestfriend became very close. He has told her that she means a lot to him, texts her all the time and he made up a nickname for her and called her by it yesterday. This might not mean anything with some people but it‚Äôs wierd because he was never good with words when we were together (never complimented me except for 1 time and i complimented him first so again i only think he said because he thought he had to). What‚Äôs wierd is, my bestfriend (that became close to him) was one of the reasons we broke up because as it turns out, it was all a rumor and he didn‚Äôt say he liked any other girl. Anyway, i kind of think she likes him and he does too.

t3_dkkfth,"Led on hard, is she sincere or just shitty?","Tl;dr: we had an incredible first couple weeks, and then out of nowhere she starts becoming really distant and cancels on me every time I offer something. Is it the right person wrong time, or is it the wrong person altogether?

Long story short I met a girl on tinder and within the first couple weeks things were honestly very magical and beautiful, I think we had really strong feelings for each other and we both enjoyed planning a future with each other, we said the l word pretty soon and I think I really felt it, everything was just so amazing with her. She invited me to meet her family and of course I was ecstatic.

She has a lot of fucked up shit in her life, deaths, suicides, drugs in the family, etc., but I'm very empathetic and I become more invested if I feel like you need a good person on your side because that's what a relationship is for me. 

I met her family and stay with them for a weekend and the day we get back Out of nowhere she gets news that her ex's friend died and that now she feels too overwhelmed to be with me. To me it didn't make a lot of sense because she had opened up about most of the other shit in her life and this seemed like something she'd want to pull me closer for. We had planned on meeting my family in the days following and, even though she wouldn't want to be introduce as my gf, she wanted to meet them. 

On the way home we talk about our situation, I offer to go way slower while she works on things and she likes that idea - she more or less wanted to be a casual relationship until she was ready to be with me. Over the course of the next few weeks she becomes more and more distant, cancels everything I try to plan, all the while going to parties and telling me she doesn't want me to take care of her while she is sick (which I had already done once). I saw her maybe once the next week for a few hours. 

I confront her saying I thought taking time for herself and going slow was what she wanted, but she says it was more of ""just friends"" and maybe kiss or have sex if she felt like it. Which are not the same thing to me. She says something like ""I only want to be with you and I'm not going to date anyone else, I just can't be with you right now"" and she doesn't know when she will be able to. So of course this gives me hope for the future, but also I have no idea when this will be.

At this point I'm trying to figure out if she is actually struggling getting through hard times in her life and she actually wants me in her life, while she makes pretty much 0 effort to keep me in her life, or she is just trying to get me to fuck off without saying it. I honestly feel like I need so much closure but if I give her the benefit of the doubt I end up thinking about parts of our relationship that don't add up until I feel like she is just a liar. Should I make an effort to stay in her life if she needs me or should I take this really deranged and hurtful hint?",dating_advice
t3_dkqqb8,Losing my virginity as a guy,"Hey! 

So I'm very lost in the world of dating and sexual interactions. I [19M] have had a gf for 6 months, but we never did anything other than making out. So really, I have 0 sexual experience. 

Anyways, I've been talking to this girl for about a month now. We've hit it off really good, texted a lot. At a party 2 weeks ago we made out. Last Thursday and yesterday I was at her house because her parents are out of town. Again, I struggle with getting the courage to do anything else. I just don't know what to do, I feel extremely clueless.

Where do I start? Say as last week we were laying on the sofa, making out and lots of cuddling. But I just have absolutely 0 clue of what is expected for me to following this. I don't know how to engange or start, especially because she usually wears skinnier and girlier clothing that is really tight, and I actually no clue how to start taking them off. When do I even start doing that? 

I know there's not a step to step guide because people are different, but I'm going to visit her tomorrow because it's her last day home alone. I just feel that I really want to do this, but I don't know how and struggle to find the courage. Is there any talking involved? Or is the communication just supposed to be by interactions? I just feel totally clueless.",dating_advice

t3_dkih7n,God I miss crushing on people!!!,"Hello guys. I'm a female in prime of my youth and reproductive age (18-25yrs). I'm plainly average in all ways and sorts. And my problem is VERY grave.

You see I have not been crushing on anyone since more than a year. I haven't had any sexual or romantic feelings for anyone in a long time. It's so annoying and distressing. 

I'm a normal girl who used to be able to crush on any random stranger I made eye contact with at the airport. But now I can't even like someone casually enough to say yes to go on a date. A fooking casual date!!

I miss having a crush. I miss that adrenaline. That jittery legs and fingers when they're around. Those tongue tied moments. And eventual paralyzed state of body and mind. Those happy hours I waste on day dreaming about them. And those scenarios I imagine with them. 

Ughghhj...I know having a crush is the worst but it's also the best. My life is getting boring and more boring everyday and sometimes I get so anxious thinking this out. All my friends talk about this guy and that guy and that girl. And I have no one I admire. Even from afar. Even if it's just a crush.

t3_dkqn1b,Jealousy starts with a lack of self respect .,"Being human means that we feel all sorts of emotions and Of coarse knowing how to handle them is key.  However, I think we can all agree that when it comes to a significant other , controlling your emotions may be difficult at times. A constant problem in many relationships is miscommunication and jealousy. 

We live in an age where we‚Äôre more connected to our neighbors than EVER before. Social media opens doors to new relationships and business approaches.. and that worries people. Why do we check dm‚Äôs? Why do we ask about that partner at work ? Why do we get accused of flirting or entertaining things? The point of a relationship is to trust and grow with that individual . Boundaries should be made clear but there‚Äôs a limit . You shouldn‚Äôt have to lock down your man or woman. You shouldn‚Äôt restrict access to the outside. That person may be in a relationship with you but they are not yours &amp; vice versa . That is why you must have the security within yourself to be able to allow your significant other to live freely. They can cheat sure but you worrying about it isn‚Äôt going to help your relationship . Over thinking leads to assumptions and emotions are placed behind those assumptions . Keep a clear head , remember the boundaries , and trust your person . Overthinking , being controlling , and being needy will surely just get you pushed away . Respect and value yourself. You‚Äôre too good to stress over what you can‚Äôt control. A relationship goes two ways , I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre thinking similarly about you .",dating_advice

Recently, I [F, 22] have been getting back to back messages from my ex boyfriend [M, 22] to be FWB. We were together for two years, but that was a whole three years ago. Throughout those past three years we have casually hung out a handful of times. Keep in mind I don‚Äôt have romantic feelings for him anymore. 

Long story short, I‚Äôm still a virgin. When we were together I was just not ready to have sex. Any other opportunity to have sex after that relationship just never..... happened. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm completely over being a virgin and am so ready to lose it. Porn can only do so much. Anyways, I have had the opportunity to lose it countless times but am not into the idea of a one night stand with some rando. I‚Äôm also far too busy to date/be in a relationship and am actually moving out of state in a couple of months, which eliminates the possibility of losing it to someone ‚Äúspecial.‚Äù That being said, I still want to lose it with someone I‚Äôm actually comfortable with. 

My main concern of the whole situation goes back to the same reason I broke up with him. My ex was pretty immature and hasn‚Äôt seem to change in these last couple of years.

t3_dkqelw,"Coming off too hot, what's next?","Background; four years ago I was at a party with a friend of mine with some of his girl friends. It was really cozy and great fun, and I was fortunate enough to get a chance to talk to this really cool, smart and witty girl. We spent the rest of the night just talking, the two of us, ignoring the ongoing party.

Now, the day is over and we part ways and nothing could come of it really, as she was in a relationship and I was moving to Germany for school. That's fine and I thought it was a perfect example of a fellow person you just click with. Never talked to her again.

Fast forward four years and I saw her updating her Facebook picture, so I asked my friend out of curiosity if he knew whether she was single or not, to which he said yes, she was single. Now, I didn't really think too much about it but the very next day I bump into her on the bus. She didn't recognize me and I wasn't too sure if it was her or not as the bus was quite crowded. I didn't say hi but I passed her a message on Face and asked if she was on that very same bus. Few hours later she confirmed and was surprised to hear from me. We instantly hit it off, just as we did four years ago and we started casually talking. Things were going great from what I could tell, with both being flirtatious, sending each other videos of her life at uni, pictures of her self, jokes, memes, deeper questions etc., pretty well rounded.

Now, over the last two months I've been on a high at times, as engaging with her is great fun and it's a great addition to my life; I'm looking forward to hearing from her and flirt with her. I'm well aware of her busy schedule with school outside of where we hail from, trying to get friends in a different country - surviving basically. And I do know she rarely uses her phone or social medias, as she blatantly told me and excused herself for not replying instantly at times. My friend confirms this as he a great friend of hers and he knows we've been engaging with each other. That's fine.

My problem is this; I believe I've came off too fast and smothered her a bit, as I feel the conversation is 1) (usually) always me initating and 2) more abrupt and short. I'm in this peculiar situation that I give everything for stuff that interests me, her included, which I know is a bad thing. She hasn't said I've smothered her outright and contrary, she's confirmed I should just continue doing the same. She did, however, confirm that the whole situation is rather hard for her at times given the circumstances; she talks more with me than any of her friends e.g.

After thinking more and fearing that I'm back to my old self of cramming her with texts, I've tried to slow down a bit and let her enjoy uni life. But at the same time the responses are more platonic and sporadic now, I feel, almost like its dying down. It takes a whole while longer to hear from her and she doesn't really initiate her self. However, she always challenges and asks indepth once we do talk and it's always a longer texting session. It's therefor a mixed bag which confuses me.

She will be back in roughly 1 1/2 months so my idea was to don't pester her every single day but check up on her once in a while in an effort to build that attraction (better) so by the time she's back should be easier for her to accept a date.

Question is; how should I proceed and how do I find back to the groove? I feel I should have the answer myself but I'm keen on other perspectives on whether I came off too strong is true and what I could do about it now that I (presumably) have damaged the courting period a bit.

t3_dkqa6x,Is he just not interested?,"Met a guy that I have a lot of mutual friends with on Tinder about a month ago. He took the first initiative, and asked me out for a beer. Since then, we've been on five ""dates"" (not really sure if he views them as dates, but at least we've hung out and drunk alcohol, watched movies, talked for hours), **but** I've been the one taking initiative on the last four.

In my opinion, we have good conversations and a lot of common interests. What bothers me is that he never initiates. Whenever I ask him if he wants to hang out, he usually responds very quickly. Yet, the fact that I've had to send the first text the last four times strikes me as a red flag.

We've had sex once, and he seems less experienced than my former sexual partners. Nonetheless, he has excellent social skills, and I assume he understands that I'm interested in him. 

After the third time we saw each other, I tried asking more open questions e.g. ""Are you interested in us seeing each other again?"" and he responded positively. Yet...the fact that he never sends the first text to initiate hanging out makes me wonder if I should just give up.

On the other side, I also wonder if I'm just letting gender norms get to my head. As a female, I'm not used to initiating things. When I get pursued by men I'm not interested in, I usually give clear signs indicating I'm not interested. He's not giving clear signs, as far as I'm concerned.

I've talked to some of my close friends about this, and their responses range from ""pursue him, he's just shy/inexperienced"" to ""he's probably not interested in you, don't narrow down your options"". Some have told me I should stop sending the first text and see if he contacts me, some have told me that I should continue and be honest about my perspective the next time I meet him. Which is why I turn to you, Reddit.

**TLDR: I (female, early 20s) have been the one sending him (male, mid/late 20s) the first text 4 out of 5 dates. He never initiates, but he always responds. Should I take his lack of initiative as a sign that he's not interested?**",dating_advice

t3_dk8ay3,Feel like somethings wrong with me bc I haven‚Äôt been in an official relationship?," I feel like I‚Äôm kind of in a weird place where I get at least some attention from girls, they‚Äôre usually receptive, and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm getting rejected left and right. 

I connected really well with this one girl last semester, we both liked each other, and it felt like someone understood me, but the physical side of the relationship could never get going for a combination of reasons (she was conservative, VERY religious, shy, and I was shy, and hesitant to make a real move), so she eventually just wanted to be friends. That was my first real experience with girls, and I think I learned a lot.

I‚Äôve since learned from that, and I went on a date recently and made some light touching, and I feel like I‚Äôm understanding physical things better, and how to maneuver myself in that way. Things kind of felt off for unrelated reasons so I just never went through with the second date,(even though she said yes) and she didn‚Äôt say anything, so I assume she wasn‚Äôt interested as well. 

I almost feel like it‚Äôs really easy to connect on a surface level with girls and I don‚Äôt really get how go anywhere beyond that. I‚Äôm a sophomore in college and I feel like as someone who doesn‚Äôt have any sexual experience it‚Äôs starting to get embarrassing and concerning. Like I get attention, I feel confident in my ability to make girls laugh, be playful, tease them, but I don‚Äôt know how to actually escalate things to a physical point. I‚Äôve kind of terrified of someone rejecting my physical advances and thinking I‚Äôm weird. 

I wish I could see myself from a 3rd person perspective and see what I‚Äôm doing wrong. Am I too nice, too friendly, not assertive enough, too intimidating, etc, etc. Am I showing too much interest, too little, is it because I live at home and don‚Äôt dorm, is it bc I‚Äôm ugly, is it bc something‚Äôs wrong with me, and the list goes on. 

And this last month or two I‚Äôve really kind of tried to put myself out there both romantically and socially, and I‚Äôve gotten a lot of Snapchats, messaging girls and stuff, but I‚Äôve hungout with only 3 of them, and only one of those was like an  official date. 

And pursuing and chasing was kind of taking a toll on my mental health, just bc it kind of requires a lot of effort and it‚Äôs draining, so I just have kind of been taking a break for a couple weeks.

Although I'm not sure about texting. We text almost everyday, but nothing like a real conversation (Which I prefer since it gives us stuff to talk about in person), but I feel like I'm usually the one to start first. Through our limited texting history, it seems like 50% of the stuff would be about our classwork. but it's responses are more than a few words, sometimes a few sentences. Again, our in person conversations are much more in depth. I can't tell if she is a texter herself since I don't see her on her phone when we're together.",dating_advice
t3_dkmif7,Is there any hope for a anxious submissibe guy in the world of dating?,"I was trying to look into attraction because I am 21 this year and still never had the expirence of feeling desired or wanted by the opposit sex. I have expirenced people flirting with me casually and looking at me in ways I imagine is them finding me attractive. Physically I am (not to sound big-headed, if anything I am the most self critical person I know) but I am physically attractive. And I am greatful that I look the way I do.

But it's my understanding (please correct if wrong) that the vast majority of female attraction comes from behaviour (confidence) and dominance (power). Not all women but the same way I'd say male attraction is mostly physical Appearence and novatly. Not all male attraction but in this world there is bassically every possible variety of human and you can not account for all of them or assume that because a variety of human exists you are going to even come into contact with someone of that variety in your life.

So, I know I'm not alone in my orientation and my confidence issue. But it feels like there's not any females that are the other side of this. I don't really get how nature could make a subset of humans that are attracted to a certain thing without there being the counter part unless we are really just suppose to be the followers that do the work but don't reproduce because are genetics are fucked. That sounds really dark and horrible but nature is dark and horrible and I don't hold nature accountable as I am a asset of nature.

But I just want to know is this how life is just suppose to be? I thought before it was because I was unhappy and depressed and tbf I was extremely lonely and depressed. But I overcame this and I am happy to say that now a days I feel so much better with my self and other people's opinions and my interpretation of others opinions of me dose not bother me anymore. I mean will I have to break from my norms in order to attract anyone? I have come to terms with the idea of being alone forever, and being a virgin. I just don't care. I just want to lead a successful life and not let stupid feelings ruin my opitunities. However I still try to date. But it feels like everywhere I go for help everyone's telling me indirectly, that I have to be dominant. As in my friend saying to me. It feels like everyone acts like that's not what reality is but it really is. Honestly I could really care less about having a relashionship anymore. But I would really like to just feel wanted I guess. It's pretty hard to keep my head up when these feelings that have been ingrained in me for awhile from years of severe anxiaty and rejection that ultimately lead me to feel like a worthless male, not that males are worthless but that me a submissive male is worthless. I don't feel this way anymore but it's hard to focus on stuff like work and uni and staying healthy and working out, doing my routines like meditation and yogo because I get these spikes in feeling worthless and I loose all my motivation. I still fight through this, and I belive I will be fine on my own and if I really have to go through life alone forever then I guess that is my destiny. But I'd really really much rather just having the expirence I guess. I donno it's hard to explain. I guess I'm kinda just lost.",dating_advice

t3_dkpnoh,Unexpected behaviour...need advice,"[24M, from Italy] I've been seeing this girl for 3 dates now and, beside her texting habits (which are erratic and unusual) everything seems great. 
Awesome chemistry, our kisses are passionate and she can't seem to resist me. To the point where we held hands and she placed her head on my shoulder and asked to be hugged because of the cold temperatures. 
She's warm and welcoming, like genuinely interested, asks questions and talks a lot.
Isn't that a girlfriend vibe? Which I am totally fine with, since I like her a ton. 

As we were making out I really wanted to take things further so I asked her ""when I'll get a chance to be alone with you?"" (We were sitting at the train station). 
(Bear in mind we live 2 hours away from each other).
At that point something snapped and she gave me a weird talk about us not getting serious since (quote) "" I like you but not enough to start a LTR"" and ""being around you feels good, we could see each other every now and then but no serious commitment"" and also ""it'd be hard because we live too far"" however ""on Tuesday you can SPEND THE NIGHT AT MY PLACE but don't expect commitment"". 

And there she goes, french kissing me her way back home on the train and texting ""arrived home safe"" 50 minutes later.

What on earth did I just witness? A woman's [22] way of earning a booty call? A defence mechanism to screen out a potentially clingy guy? 

I want to make clear I've never even mentioned getting serious or starting a LTR. My idea was getting to know her, see where things go and accept whatever comes out of it. 
The days of ingenuity and false dating promises are long gone for me, even though I'm hopeful I'll meet a good woman to build a life with :) 

So here I am wondering what I should do next. I won't hide I'd love her to be my girlfriend, though now seems the worst of times to even think of it.",dating_advice
t3_dkmbkf,Did I just get ghosted for no reason?,"Okay, so this has happened multiple times. Of course, all different but this one really got to me because of how random it was. 

I (21f) got a message from a guy (25m) on Instagram, started chatting, eventually started texting and met up maybe a little over a week later. At first I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to really go anywhere. I mean I wasn‚Äôt actively looking for anything. But meeting up went really well, he was super nice, funny, caring, respectful, everything. I was really surprised of how big of a crush I ended up having on this guy. And he verbally expressed that he felt the same way about me. So after meeting up the one time, we continue texting of course. A month goes by and I keep teasing him when we‚Äôre going to meet up next. He seemed to be terrible with making plans. But we finally did. We continuously talk as normal every day throughout the day up to the day we had originally planned to hang out again. Again, everything was fine. We were snapchatting throughout the day, at one point I sent him something along the lines of ‚Äúwhen do I get to come over today‚Äù. An hour goes by and I check to make sure my message sent. And I see he blocked my snapchat, instagram, phone number... he didn‚Äôt even open my message, just blocked. 

Why? There‚Äôs nothing that would have made him mad, annoyed, whatever, to have wanted to block me. It was right in the middle of a conversation. He seemed to be so into me, so this was the last thing I would‚Äôve expected from him. I noticed he had just gotten out of a relationship (gf cheated on him) around 3 weeks before he messaged me first. So I‚Äôm thinking it has something to do with that but... I‚Äôm not one to just ghost someone like that. Especially if I was the one to make the first move in the first place.",dating_advice
t3_dkm8xr,Has my coworker (F24) friend zoned me (M26)?,"So I‚Äôve been working with this girl for a couple of months now. I got to know her at work for like 3 weeks and then one day when she was crying out that she was craving something to eat I jumped on that and asked her out in a way. I just said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go after we get off‚Äù or something along those lines. We had a nice dinner and spent a few hours together. It was a really nice night and I really felt we had great chemistry. I saw her the next day and things were as they‚Äôd been for the past few weeks leading up to that with us: talkative, playful teasing, fun, and overall good vibes. 

The next week I ask her what her plans are for the weekend. She said she had a couple of things going on and that it was one of her relatives‚Äô birthday on Sunday in the evening. I ask her to hang out Sunday in the morning if she wasn‚Äôt too busy to which she immediately said yes and to send her the details. So a couple of days later I text her 2 options knowing that she had an engagement in the evening she then replied that the plans had changed and now she was busy in the morning too. I totally understood but the red flag for me was she **did not provide any opportunity for re-scheduling or showed any interest in re-scheduling**. I saw her at work at the beginning of the week and she did not acknowledge that we hadn‚Äôt been able to link up or anything about our previously attempted scheduled plans. She acted like nothing had happened. So I didn‚Äôt bring it up taking it as a rejection. 

One day she begins asking all these questions about my dating preferences. Which throws me for a loop but also makes me wonder why she‚Äôs even interested in the first place. Asks me what my type is and seems pleased when I describe many traits that she has. So then I think maybe it‚Äôs still on?

Fast forward a few days and we have plans to get dinner with another co-worker (this girl that used to work with us on the same shift). We meet up she gets there and we start talking before our other friend shows up. Again I feel like we have good chemistry like always. Then when all three of us are there she begins to talk to us about some guy that had DM‚Äôd her. She reads some of the DM‚Äôs to us and then reads pretty much the whole text thread she later has with the dude but it seemed like she wasn‚Äôt interested and she was mostly highlighting the more douchey messages he‚Äôd sent her. 

A little while later she says the weirdest thing I‚Äôve heard someone say for a while. She just says that because we‚Äôre her friends we should back her up on this. Then she says she‚Äôs been on a bit of a dry spell and that we shouldn‚Äôt get any ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) until she does. The other girl just says how she‚Äôs engaged and that‚Äôs not going to happen. I just laugh at the whole absurdity of that statement and she seems kind of almost playfully offended that I won‚Äôt ‚Äúback her up‚Äù on this. 

At this point I‚Äôm going to assume she‚Äôs friendzoned me and that I‚Äôve got no chance. She cancelled our second date and didn‚Äôt attempt to reschedule, is now talking about kind of a-hole dudes that DM her, and is saying that she‚Äôs on a dry spell directly in front of me. 

Is there any realistic alternative interpretation to the whole dry spell thing? Was her not trying to reschedule the date a blatant sign that she‚Äôs 100% not into me? If this isn‚Äôt pointing to me being knee deep in the friendzone then what do I do now? I‚Äôm definitely still interested. 

TL:DR coworker and I went out to dinner. Asked her out again she said yes but then said she couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt try to reschedule at all or provide an opportunity for me to do so. Had dinner with her and another coworker/friend during which she talked about another guy that was messaging her and that she‚Äôs on a dry spell and that I shouldn‚Äôt be able to ‚Äúget some‚Äù before she does as a demonstration of friendship. Am I in the friendzone? If not, then what do I do from here on out?",dating_advice

I was stupid enough not to get her contact info. She only told me her name, and I managed to find her facebook profile later when I came home.  
Would it be weird to send her a message out of the blue and ask her out without her giving me her facebook/contact info?

t3_dkp021,"Need some advice, but pretty sure I already know the answer 24M","Sorry this is quite long.. 

TL;DR: probably getting lead on but I'm also aware I was being lead on. Need random strangers to confirm what I already know to be true. 

So there's this girl who I was crushing on on and off for a while, but she was in a relatioship at the time and I was only back in my home town spontaneously from uni every now and then, which was when I saw her.

Fast forward to the start of this summer. She's single and we're out in town. We go home together, but it's a weird vibe. We don't do anything and she pretty much throws herself at me, I'm lowkey a bit uncomfortable and she deffo just wants a shag. I tell her I think she knows I like her, we have a drunken chat and a bit of a kiss but nothing happens. Just end up spooning.

I'm proper weirded out by this, feel odd the next few days. I take a punt and ask her out for a drink, she says no and that she's just come out of a controlling relationship and doesn't want anything. Then, she sends me a picture of my tinder profile like an hour after I asked her out. Then she proceeds to send screen shots of conversations she's had with tinder blokes, until I call her out saying that that's weird behaviour considering I just asked her out. She apologies and said she's feels bad.

I then go on holiday, and for some reason keep talking to the girl on and off. Should've have taken the hint.

Fast forward a week or two, we end up hooking up and lowkey seeing each other. We start talking every day and seeing each other every weekend. Never just the two of us, we have close mutual friends who are engaged, so we hang as a four. We're pretty much double dating, except we weren't really dating.

When hanging out, I never get the impression she's fully in to me. Never properly engaging me in conversation, we only seemed to talk properly when we're drunk, alone together or online.

Fast forward a few weeks, I ask her out for a drink just the two of us. We get on to the topic of what we're doing together, which ends with her saying she doesn't think she really knows me properly, doesn't think about whether or not she likes me unless I bring it up, and that she just wanted to be single. I'm pretty caught off guard, considering how much we'd been talking and seeing each other. Despite this chat, I end up going back to hers, but nothing sexual happens. 

I send a message a few days later saying that I need to take a step back from this situation, give her time to focus on herself and figure things out. She says something along the lines of, shes not felt herself and not been talking to many people, and that my decision was 'fair enough'. She seemed completely unohased to be honest. 

Foolishly, we kept chatting for a few days, until conversation eventually fizzled out. 

We don't speak for a few weeks, until we run in to each other on nights out. We then start a going out as a 4 again, and after all this time my feelings for her still haven't changed. Still in to her. 

I regret telling her that I wanted to call things off, but I'm pretty sure I was getting strung along pretty hard and she never wanted a relationship. She even said it herself, after all. Part of me is also like, what if she thinks I'm not in to her and me calling things off implies I don't like her? I also think this is dumb, because I told her I like her.. Idk

Anyways we went out again the other day, and she was just fully getting with a bloke in front of me, and I was just like... Damn gotta just roll with this I spose and keep a cool head. 

I'm still in to her, despite all this shit and it's properly messing with my brain. What do gang?",dating_advice

t3_dkovg2,"How often do men take women on dates? Sorry for the totally heterosexual question but this is a question for my situation, and I totally support all relationships.","I started dating a guy a month and a half ago. We didn‚Äôt have a first date, we met at a friends party, drank a bit too much, went back to his place, messed around a bit (no sex), and then I left in the morning, taking my own lyft home. Since we started dating, he has taken me to drinks once and dinner twice (one was forced bc the waitress gave him the receipt, and I offered to pay my portion, but I made sure to get his drink at the next place we went, and we didn‚Äôt drink anymore after that). All the dates in between included me going to his place, him coming to my place, me providing a few bottles of wine in the mix, me cooking for him, me buying movie snacks after he bought the tickets. We have also been to a couple dinners and places that required tickets where I have paid my own way. Now granted, I know his tab outweighs mine at this point, and I also have spent my fair share of money on new outfits (my wardrobe sucked), a doctors visit to get an IUD because I‚Äôm allergic to latex and it was the best solution for sex after we both got tested (aka I got a device installed in my vagina for him), and multiple below the waist action for him (I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm allowed to say and what I‚Äôm not allowed to say in this advice column), and waxes to make things a bit nicer down there. 

So here is the question. I got a message saying ‚Äúhey, would you like to go to cirque next Saturday night, 8pm? Followed by a message saying ‚Äútickets are $70.‚Äù In a way, I was taken back a bit bc I thought he was asking me on a date. And in my mind, he would buy my ticket and it would be super sweet, and then through the night, I would make sure to buy drinks or dinner or something. I usually like to be courted and then my generosity flood gates open! I politely declined his offer because I said ‚Äúthank you, and it sounded like you were going to take me on a date, and then not so much, so I‚Äôll pass on this one.‚Äù 

Am I being unrealistic as far as how I should be courted? I have a good job, he has a good job, and I am willing to take him to dinners and surprise him with tickets to things, and I maybe would have already if most of the stuff we have done haven‚Äôt been pre planned group stuff. Please advise. And please do not call me a gold digger, I‚Äôm not asking for Chanel bags and benzes, I‚Äôm just asking for some good old fashioned courtship.",dating_advice
t3_dkllq3,I never thought that my first dating experience would be like this,"I¬¥m a 25yo guy who met this 24yo girl six months ago at work. She came to the company I work in to complete a project for 3 months. We worked in different departments but we used to see each other around three times per week during break time. We became friends very easily since the beginning as we had many things in common. She  almost came to say hi and started a conversation. I started liking her more and more as weeks passed by and began thinking about when to ask her out.

It was the final days of her stay in our company when she asked me if I could help her with some work-related stuff, she said that she was going to invite me lunch and dinner in return. I agreed of course. We met two different days and I had a great time helping her. The last day I was supposed to see her we went to get dinner to a restaurant close to our company. It went perfect. After dinner, I offered to drive her back home. She agreed initially but then she changed her mind and asked me to leave her at the bus stop saying that she didn¬¥t want to make me drive so long. Later that night I texted her saying that I had a great time meeting her and that I enjoyed spending time with her, and asking if she wanted to go out with me the next weekend. She replied me after one week saying: ¬®I¬¥m so sorry I¬¥ve been so busy with work. I need vacations :(. If you wanna invite‚Ä¶. I¬¥m craving Indian food :P¬®. I took that as a positive answer and asked her if she was free on Saturday. She said: ¬®I have a meeting in the afternoon until 6pm. Just that.¬® I said: ¬®Great. Let¬¥s meet at XXX then¬®. She didn¬¥t reply. I was confused because she seemed to agree initially and then she backed off. That Saturday I texted around noon: ¬®Hey, are we meeting at 6 tonight ?¬® She didn¬¥t reply me until 6:30pm saying. ¬®I¬¥m just done with my meeting XD¬®. I didn¬¥t know what to respond, so I just said: ¬®Wow, so late. Should we leave it for another day?¬®. She said: ¬®ok‚Ä¶ :¬¥(¬®. During the next days I was very confused about what happened, and was wondering whether I should insist with her or not. Two weeks after, on a Friday night, I texted her again:¬®Hey, wanna go out tomorrow ?¬®. She ignored my message completely. Around two weeks after , on a Monday night,  I decided to give it a last try and texted her again. The conversation went like this:

Me: Hi, how are you ?

She:I¬¥m good :). How about you?

Me: I¬¥m good too. Any plans for the weekend.

She: Hmmm. On Friday I have classes until 10pm, and on Saturday probably I¬¥m going to the gym.

Me: I was wondering if we could go out on Saturday. Indian food maybe? Anything you want :)

At that point she stopped texting, but replied very early the next morning: ¬®It depends. I¬¥m gonna ask my friend at what time we are leaving the gym. I¬¥ll let you know :).¬® After reading that I thought it was over. However, to my surprise she texted me again on Friday very late at night when I was about going to bed. She said: ¬®Hey, it seems I¬¥m not working out tomorrow xD. Are you still free tomorrow‚Ä¶ any plans? Lets go to XXX :D. I REALLY want to go there :(¬®.

So she wanted to go to a festival happening in our town that was perfect for a first date with music, food and a lot of fun things to do. I was very happy that she reached back to me again so I said yes immediately. She seemed pretty excited about going there, and I was glad that she wanted to go there with me. During our conversation it turned out that the festival was not scheduled for Saturday but for Sunday, and that tickets were already sold out.  We agreed to get tickets from a ticket reseller and go there on Sunday anyway. The next day at night (Saturday) I texted her asking her at that what time she wanted me to pick her up, but to my surprise she said: ¬®Hey, I told my older sister about our plan and she suggested me not to go since we could get scammed from a false vendor. She was scammed a couple of months ago. I think we shouldn¬¥t go sorry :(. It was gonna be pretty fun :(¬®. I was very sad after reading that text, however, what she was saying about the ticket scamming was quite reasonable. I still tried to take her to other place on Sunday, and I asked her: ¬®What about if we go the movies tomorrow ?. There is an European movie festival at XXX¬®. She didn¬¥t reply me after the next morning

She: What movie?

Me: XXX, It seems it¬¥s about YYY.

She: To be honest, I don¬¥t like going to the movies. I watch mainstream movies from time to time, though.

Me: How can you not like going to the movies. Everyone does !

She: Well, I think it¬¥s boring going to a place just to sit and watch a large screen for two hours. For that I prefer to stay at home and watch Netflix XD. I prefer outdoor activities like walking, traveling,‚Ä¶.

Me: Well, I didn¬¥t know. Sorry.  Have you been at ZZZ. It¬¥s at the other side of the town. One-hour ride.

She: Nop. Have you?

Me: Yep. There a lot of things to do and see: boat rides, a farm, beautiful landscapes, and a lot of place to walk‚Ä¶

She: Really ? Sounds pretty fun :D. I love animals &lt;3.

Me: If you want we can go there next weekend.

After that, she never texted me back and I decided to move on.

One month after I was doing great. I wasn¬¥t thinking about her anymore‚Ä¶ when she appeared again. She was back to our company but this time she was staying only for two months, and was coming just once per week. The first time we met again in person was pretty awkward. She came to me, said hi and sit next to me. Our conversation was pretty weird with many dumb jokes and silly comments  to break awkward silences. We talked for ten minutes until we had to go back to work. The next days we met were pretty much the same. I tried to keep a little distant since I didn¬¥t want to be emotionally involved again. However, I could not stop thinking why she would always come to talk after rejecting me despite our conversations being quite boring lately. So I started thinking about asking her out one more time but this time in person.

When I thought things could not get worse, I learned from a recently hired coworker, who happens to know her as well, something very shocking to me. It turns out that the girl I have been trying to date during the past months already has a boyfriend, and has been with him for ten months. What is even more shocking to me is that she actually introduced me to him once but never mentioned he was her boyfriend. It was the same day that she asked me for help in the beginning. Not only that, what is more humiliating, is that the day I was helping her with her stuff her boyfriend was there for a while. So basically for a moment I was doing her work while she was BUSY talking with her boyfriend just in front of me. I never thought or suspected he could be her boyfriend as I REALLY thought he was her gay friend.

At this point, I don¬¥t know how to react to this. Why did she never told me about her boyfriend ? I have mixed feelings about this girl. On the one hand, I think she is bad person and that she is playing and manipulating me. I think she should have mentioned her boyfriend after the first time I asked her out or if she didn¬¥t want to, she could have been more direct and tell me she wasn¬¥t interested. On the other hand, I think she didn¬¥t have to tell me about her boyfriend as I never asked directly. However, when I asked her what she used to do besides working and studying she used to reply that she only hanged out with her friends if she ever had time.

And this girl is amazing, checked all my ""worth it"" boxes and more, I didn't know people this awesome existed. And I thought everything was going great, until it took a 180.

We met as friends, slowly though she seemed to be interested at least more than normal, despite meeting her amongst a group of other guys and girls, I connected most with her. We share the same life values, similar life goals and outlooks, as well as some mutual interests. I hang out with her some more, plenty of times alone, and as I become more interested in her, it seems she's becoming more interested in me. Eventually, it seems she really likes me, all the signs are there: sweetly holding my shoulder, letting me hold her hand, sitting really close, playful slapping, laughs hysterically at things I say that weren't even that funny, long stares into my eyes, calls me cute or handsome every time I see her, lets me even rub her leg in private. I have also paid attention in groups, this isn't how she treats other guys. Hell, she even cooks me my favorite meal whenever she's over (and gets upset with herself when it isn't perfect for me even if it's just fine), and gives me spontaneous massages! We had even made plans to go to her hometown during Chinese New Year, invited me to her house!

So I'm thinking after our last meet up that basically convinced me that she definitely liked me: ""ok, time to ask her to be my girlfriend"". I walk her home, happy goodbyes.... And then when I get home I get a long text basically saying: ""do you like me? If you do, I want to thank you, you are so great and the first person I truly admire and like-not love. I must say sorry though, even though we have many things in common and you have many qualities I admire, I have to say we can only be friends now. You know, you only stay here for 2 more months. There will be no result between us (broken english, no idea what this means). And distance makes things awkward. But, you can still come to my hometown, and I will be a good guide and take care of you""

This came at exactly the time I thought everything was going perfectly, so I am obviously very confused. In response, I kinda said ""well of course we're still friends, but I think this is something to talk about in person. I'm a bit confused"". We are still on good terms, this was all yesterday, and today I texted her again, just a normal happy conversation. I guess I'm ok with being just friends, but obviously I wanted something more, and the trouble is I seriously thought she did too.

Also, as a little bonus, her good friend roommate also was being pursued by a German guy that the friend actually really wanted to date, yet the friend rejected him as well at the last minute, because of distance. Like roommate like roommate...?

I'm hoping to talk to my girl in person of course, probably this weekend, but do you have any pointers on how to approach it? If she is just hesitant about distance, I want to be able to calm those worries. Cuz we mesh so well together, it would be a real shame to let such an amazing connection drop for simply distance and time. I've done long distance before, and know what it takes. But most of all, do you think she, like her friend, actually does want to date me, but is simply hesitant about distance? Or is she just a super unique person who for some reason is only super touchy and gf-like with me even though she only sees me as a friend from the beginning?",dating_advice

t3_dkjqie,Moral conflict,"About two years ago I got out of a long term relationship.  We were together for 12 years.  She was two years older than me and while the age gap was significant when we were in highschool the difference meant less as the years went by.  The breakup was mutual and we remained friends.  I still miss her, but I have no regrets.  Our lives just took us in different directions.

I'm glad I took the necessary time to be okay being single, I didn't want to rush into a new relationship.

I had been saving money to go back to school, I don't like the idea of having debt.  I work and take classes.  First day of school I leave to go to my car and a girl from my class ran after me to ask my name.  We talked for a few minutes then went our separate ways.  The next day she sat right next to me in a room full of empty chairs, we had a pleasant conversation before class.  This went on for several days.  I finally told myself I should ask her out next time I see her, so I did and she said yes.  It was a definite kind of yes.  We met for coffee at a local place and hit it off right away.  Immediately I fell for her, we had so much in common, and two hours went by in an instant.  When she told me she had to go I asked if she wanted to meet up again, she gave me another hard yes.

We've been getting together for over a month now.  She's gorgeous and outgoing but it's her soul I'm attracted to.  We click on so many levels.  She likes me and I like her.

The only problem is the age difference.  I'm 29(m) and she's 19(f).  Neither one of us cares, but I worry about being judged.  Our relationship is equal, no power struggle.  I'm not taking advantage of her, my feelings are genuine.

I was hoping to get some advice on the morality of dating someone who happens to be quite a bit younger.",dating_advice
t3_dkldxm,I don't have experience and don't know what to do when girls/friends flirt with me at the bar/club,"Basically, I'm a 21M who's never had a girlfriend. Never kissed, never had sex, and in terms of ""social experience"" in general we could say I'm very ignorant. I've always had lots of social anxiety and never wanted to go out and party, make friends, etc. The last couple of years I have been trying to get out of my comfort zone and I have seen a lot of improvement, making lots of friends and having lots of fun, talking to people is becoming way easier and ejoyable. The thing is, despite the fact that I go out with friends without the ""focus"" or ""objective"" of getting a girlfriend/hooking up with someone, I have noticed despite my lack of experience that sometimes I have some girls (friends or maybe strangers) flirting with me and I never know how to escalate.

Some examples:

\- At a sports bar, with some friends, a girl from another table constantly making eye contact and smiling. I didn't do shit. I can go and talk with her but she's with her friends and I'm with mine :/

\- At a bar/house party with some friends drinking and we're a bit tipsy (not too drunk) and a girl I know that I have been talking to and I feel like she has some interest in me starts getting more flirty than usual and very touchy (like grabbing me, hugging me, etc) and I don't know how to escalate. I try to ""replicate"" a bit what she does but it feels akward and unnatural and I don't want to do something that might make her uncomfortable.

\- Or one day in the club I started dancing with a friend and she started kissing me on the neck (that's as far as I've ever gotten) but after that I had no fucking clue about how to continue, I was pretty wasted and I think I kissed her on the neck too but I don't remember properly (this doesn't usually happen I don't drink that much and I'm usually very aware of what I'm doing). Because I was feeling quite bad I ended up leaving early, but one of the main reasons besides that was the anxiety of not knowing what to do. I felt like she wanted me to do something, I mean, I'm not stupid. We stayed together for a while and I think she took me out to the street but I honestly didn't know what to do, it was the same deal as always, questioning everything. Should I just kiss her just like that? Ask her if she wants to leave? No idea.

I don't go with the mindset of picking up girls (I want to feel more comfortable with just making friends in general first) but every time an opportunity arises I feel like I'm wasting it because I don't know what to do. Any help or advice? Or maybe someone who might have shared this problems?

t3_dkjotp,Kind gestures? Or is there a meaning?,"(20M)
I need advice on this. There is a girl in my classes that is a ""friend of the world"" type. Shes nice to mostly everyone she meets from what ive seen, really peppy and knows what she wants.
In an art class i share with her. She interacts with me first usually and we talk about small stuff like shows, art, and music. Sometimes i start coversations first but im reserved around newer people.

On a working day she had to run out and get supplies. I offered to go with her (i needed some supplies too) and we had a fun little run.
On a later working day she made clear to 2 others as well as me she was going out to get more supplies. She also said if ""someone wanted to come with it would be great"" while looking in my direction in a coy way. I got rattled for some reason and refused (i was saving money at the moment). She never went on a shopping run after that and resumed her work. (She seemed bummed, im guessing she went after class)

Early before on a critique day. We got to a point where she was talking about a new puppy she was gifted recently. She asked if i wanted to give her my number to talk about him. I accepted and we talked about him here and there. We never had full coversations like in class due to how she responds (its about 20 minutes apart, i text within 10 min). In conversations she sometimes tells me what shes doing in the time cooking, drawing, etc

(There's some other things shes done but ill save those for whoever asks to keep this story short)

Personally, i think shes cute and Ill never know till i go and ask her. For the time being I just wanted someone elses take on this.",dating_advice

I know nudes are a sensitive subject for girls and that she didnt have to agree. I would have understood if she just said no but instead she ignored me for days. I apologized for talking in a weird way and causing confusion that day (long story) and she said i was missing the point so I told her if its about what I said can we just forget about it and move on and she still ignored me.

t3_dkei4d,Not sexually assaulting someone doesn‚Äôt make you a good guy,"I‚Äôve(20F) met around 10 guys from dating apps, and 1 took advantage of me when I was drunk and tried to pressure me other times, 1 literally would not leave my place until I hooked up with him, and 2 made me feel pressured to hookup with them even if I wasn‚Äôt 100% comfortable and clearly wasn‚Äôt into it. I started talking to a new guy and had plans to meet him tomorrow and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex the first time and he said it was cool at first then proceeded to try to convince me that I should and when I confronted him, said he was just being ‚Äúplayful‚Äù and he‚Äôd never force me to have sex with him. I genuinely thought maybe I was being paranoid and proceeded with my plans but I asked a guy friend and he said he was definitely low key pressuring and turned around and blamed me when confronted about it. 

I‚Äôm not saying I haven‚Äôt made mistakes and definitely could have prevented some of those situations by standing up for myself better but I was young and new to the dating scene and simply didn‚Äôt know all that‚Äôs out there and what‚Äôs normal and acceptable. But overtime I‚Äôm learned and I‚Äôm now trying to draw my lines but too many guys don‚Äôt respect that.

Not physically forcing someone doesn‚Äôt make you a good guy. Out of all of the guys I‚Äôve met, one was truly good. This one had the courtesy to actually put effort into knowing me, respecting me when I said I wanted to wait, and seeing me as more than just a body to have sex with. 1/10. What a sad statistic. 

Maybe this is just a rant but I just wanted to share this story and give you this message. Self proclaiming as being a good guy doesn‚Äôt make you a good guy. Genuinely putting the girls‚Äô comfort above your wants  is what makes you good. I‚Äôm pissed and sad and losing hope in the goodness of this society.

On the day we met we even got so far as to share a bed together (nothing sexual happened) and last Friday we went to a party together and after to my Home to spend the night.   
We've been cuddling very often, be it on the party or at my Home, and she even said that she feels just so comfortable being around me. She also had no restraints changing into her bed attire before me.

The way we interact with each other also feels like we've known each other for far more than two weeks and I am really surprised at myself because I really like her despite not knowing her for that long, we just hit it off that good.  
I'll be at hers tomorrow for about the whole day and maybe even spend the night at hers. We also already have a plan to go to an event in her hometown together and meet all her friends. I really like spending time with her and all since I just feel so comfortable being around her (she also mentioned this at the party about being really comfortable around me).

It's not like I plan on saying something like I love her, but I just want to make a somewhat clear point in telling that I really like her, but I am unsure if something like that is maybe too soon or will make her uncomfortable or think less of me for some reason, what do you all think about this?",dating_advice
t3_dkidrt,Help with a girl I'm seeing,"Without going too far into random specifics, this has been a rough year for me dating-wise. I've been through two rough breakups that have led me to be fairly cautious as I move forward with dating other people. Of note, I really only date one person at a time.

I'm currently seeing a lovely girl that I met on an app. We've been on 7-8 dates now, including 2-3 days where we spent 6-8 hours together. It's certainly not one sided, as she's asked to see me on 3-4 occasions, including some of those full day dates. However, she's been open in saying that she's (A) dating 2 other guys actively and (B) still on the apps talking/looking for other guys. Even though we date in different ways, I honestly have no issue with this....to a point. Obviously we're not in a relationship (or even exclusive yet for that matter), but given the amount of dates we've been on and the time we've been seeing each other (about 1.5 months), I'm ready to be exclusive. I brought it up to her this past week, and she wasn't totally receptive to the idea. She's suffered a couple losses in her personal life that make her wary of committing to anyone, which I totally understand. However, I'm beginning to feel as though I'm wasting my time, effort, and money on a girl who isn't really interested in what I'm looking for. 

So here's my question: given my situation, at what point would you ask her officially to be exclusive? I only brought up this subject 1 date ago, so I'm willing to give her a bit more time, but I am trying to figure out some sort of ""end point"". For the record, I understand that if I ask and she's not willing to focus on ""us"", then I'll have to break things off with her entirely. I have no qualms in doing so, but I want to make sure I'm not jumping the gun based on some random level of anxiety and my being a bit more traditional than the rest of modern dating.",dating_advice
t3_dkmib7,Should I [28F] give my ex [30M] who wasn't ready another chance?,"I first met this guy two years ago, like a month after he'd gotten out of an 8 year relationship and had been cheated on. We started dating not knowing how things would evolve, and it was incredible. We'd never met anyone like each other. We were best friends with chemistry and understood each other ways we've never felt before with previous partners. It just worked. But after a few months, it was abundantly clear that he wasn't ready for anything serious and so I ended things. I was looking for a relationship, and though it was obvious that the connection was there, I told him he needed to heal from the previous relationship, learn how to be on his own, and then to come find me when he was ready. I wanted to be a partner to him, but he wasn't ready to be a partner to anyone--he was depressed, needed to work on his mental health, and unsure if he wanted to move back home, whether to stay in his career or not. We both agreed it was for the best.

The break up doesn't really stick. We text a bit. Three months in, he tells me he misses me and wants to be together, we immediately start dating briefly again--but it's still very clear he's not ready for a relationship didn't work on his personal issues, though he is trying. Ultimately we break up again, and I am angry that he came back, put me through this again when I gave him the chance to work on himself. I tell him for his own sake, he should try therapy, and best of luck with his life. It hurt, but I moved forward, have been dating, and living a good life.

Well, about 10 months pass this time. He doesn't contact during this time per my request and now we've recently reconnected. He apologized profusely for what he has put me through in the past. He acknowledges that he shouldn't have come back last time, that he thought he was ready, but he wasn't. He hadn't done anything in those three months to heal or figure out his life. This time, in the past 10 months he has been going to therapy. He has been figure out a plan for himself, and getting back into a better headspace. He has given himself time to be on his own. He doesn't expect another chance and he doesn't want to rush in to things, like last time. He wants to take things slow, build back my trust, and build a relationship from there. He never wants to hurt me again and is so sorry for what happened previously. But the feelings are still there.

So now, I'm faced with the decision of whether or not to give this guy another chance. I'll be honest, I love him, I can still see a future with him, and I WANT to believe things will work this time. He is my favorite person in the world and the full package for me. But I don't want to be stupid and get my heartbroken again. Like I've said, I've dated around since we've broken up, met some nice guys, but no one I connected to as deeply or felt like the best version of myself, like I do around him. I'm not going to rush in to things or commit to him right away. But I'm faced with this dilemma, was it truly a case of bad timing or if we were so, so compatible, wouldn't we have worked the first time around?

tldr: ex says he is finally ready and wants another chance, should I give it to him?",dating_advice

She sent a snap of the both of us to him just to let him know that we were friends and that she didn‚Äôt like the way he treated me. He ended up telling her that I was twisting shit.

It‚Äôs been almost 3 months since we spoke. I‚Äôve spent these three months on a self love sort of thing and haven‚Äôt really been missing him much until about a week ago. There‚Äôs nothing I can do. I feel like I‚Äôm in a constant state of limerence. I talk to other guys on tinder (I went to an all girls school hence the intense use of dating apps to meet the opposite sex) but they just aren‚Äôt the same.

I really wish I could just move on. Even when I think I‚Äôve moved on I really haven‚Äôt.",dating_advice
t3_dkledi,I don't know what to do,"(Throw away account incase anyone I know recognises anything)

So I started my (M21) first job three years ago. There was another person (F33) that I started to really get along with. I started falling for her instantly. The problem was, at the time she was married. However some time passed and she has gone through divorce. For a while now we have hung out (going out to concerts and exhibits) a couple of times. Sometimes I feel like she is being flirty but I can't tell if that's just her being nice like she always is or if she is into me. I feel like the age difference is too much for her and she sees me more like a little brother than anything.

I am afraid of directly asking her directly because I really like her as a friend and I don't want to ruin that either. She is the first person I've had this much of a deep and personal connection with. Also we work quite closely together everyday and any awkwardness would potentially ruin both of our time at work. 

As a side note I have never had a relationship and I am quite bad at taking to girls romantically. I used to be bad at talking to girls in general before I became friends with her.

What do you guys think I should do? Is the age gap already a red flag and I should keep quiet and forget it? Or are there enough signs to say that it's worth a shot to potentially make my workplace too awkward?

Sorry if I formatted wrong or my sentence structure doesn't make sense. Not the best writer when it comes to this.

t3_dkii9q,help!! - getting in touch with a guy i like againg,"Hey everyone! 

So, there is a guy who I dated ONCE, but know through friends. He is sweet and we had great chemistry. 

At the end of the first date, before anything physical happened, he told me he can't ""treat me as I deserve"" due to pressure in his workplace, and he can only be with me if we are not serious. He then said that he is into me and attracted to me but he knows he can't make enough time for me, and added that he is not looking for sex but he knows he can't be in a relationship. I told him, in short, that I respect his wishes but I'm looking for something more meaningful and said that if that's the case, we should call it a night.  A week later I asked him out and he said he thinks that if we see each other again while he is still at work, we will both get hurt, and turned me down.

We hadn't spoken in months and then I approached him regarding something else (a professional question). He was kind and we spoke for a while via text. We later spoke via text twice more, he started one conversation and I started the other. That was last month. I would also note, that he currently left his job and is now, as far as I know, free, so the problem that supposedly kept him from dating me is solved. 

And here is my question - is there anything I can do to get him to ask me out again? and should I even try? I think that his ""disclaimer"" is a good thing, and he wasn't trying to fool me, but I don't know what I can do after speaking with him a few times and not getting any vibe from him.

It drives me crazy that I might have made a mistake and I don't know what to do about it.

t3_dkka0k,Not sure if this is the reason we aren't official yet,"Hey guys,

I am freaking a bit about this issue and I would appreciate so much some honest advice! :)

So...I've been dating this guy for about 5 weeks now, where we spent each weekend together and (sometime 3 days at a time) and got to know each other a fair amount of time. Also, he said he wants us to be exclusive after 2 weeks and we agreed on doing so. The issue is that I've approached the DTR talk twice already, and we both came to the conclusion that we don't want to define our relationship yet for several reasons.

I've started recently with my Master's &amp; I am also recently coming out of a 7 year relationship (pretty scary, huh).

He started recently a new job which involves him being in different cities quite often, such that we can only meet during the weekend and he might sometimes be gone for weeks at a time due to traveling outside the country. But he knows that that doesn't bother me since I also have little time to meet him.

So, for me it isn't clear yet of whether it is a right time for me to be in a relationship yet cause I am only 23, coming out of a 7y.relationship and I need lots of time for myself and my studies. But I caught feelings for him and I could imagine being with him, I see that in the future. And he knows that. And he told me he thinks things might turn good for us.

However, I am worried of investing too much of myself into this thing we have and getting hurt afterwards if he might wanna break things off...and I see him needing a lot more time to know where this is going since he isn't sure at all and his last relationship was 5 years ago or so...I did indeed wanna break up with him today but I just couldn't...

Does it sound like a solid excuse for him to not be ready yet?

Thank you so much for reading this guys! :)",dating_advice
t3_dkgx7d,Dating game is really bringing me down and don't know what to do...,"I really need to vent here.  If you read this, please stay with me here, I could use encouragement right now.  

I'm getting back in the dating scene and it's really taking me for a roller coaster ride and really playing with my emotions right now and I am having a tough time cooping with it. I honestly have been on five dates the last seven years.  My friends tell me ""get reps!"" Well, the women aren't necessarily beating down the door to talk to me, which is a shame.  I lost my dream job a year ago, although I am working some crummy hours at the moment, I landed with a great company and it's a decent spot for me to be in as I look to redeem myself.  I have a lot going for myself personally.  I try to let the women know that you're getting a guy here that is a one women man, ""you"" are priority one to me!  I would never do anything to hurt my lady, and I would do anything to make us/""you"" happy. I am a prime example of a person that has everything, and at the same that has nothing.  I been trying and trying to find someone and it just hasn't happened for me yet. I know I may sound ridiculous to say I am looking for that ""storybook"" relationship, but I know I have the will to do what it takes to make it work on my end.  If you're happy, then I am happy, that's all that matters, and I want to have fun in our relationship!  

The last couple women have really messed with me mentally and has me wondering about my own worth. The first women I was seeing I met on Match, and we clicked right away!  Every time we started messaging each other, we couldn't stop, it was one of those ""you hang up, no you hang up!"" kind of things!  We went on a couple dates, we had fun on each one!  I thought there would be a third for sure, but she text me saying ""you are a great guy!  I just don't have those feelings for you, but I would love to be your friend"". I was mature and told her that is totally fine and we can roll with it.

The last women has really got me and I am na√Øve to think that there still maybe hope, she is such a hard read that I am hoping that it just clicks again another day. We met on Bumble and we started chit chatting.  There were things that always popped up that really derailed things (she is a single mom) like her son getting sick, then her getting sick from the kid, to becoming bed ridden at one point because the sickness became a virus. She got promoted and she was overwhelmed by everything, her telling me she's also trying to be supermom on top of all this. After a couple attempts of trying to cut it off, she always came right back and apologized, and any time she didn't get back timely, she apologized then as well. Well, a few weeks ago I basically tried to cut it, telling her that dating shouldn't be her main focus, she needs to worry about her and her sons well being first with everything going on in her life before dating becomes a priority. She tells me she's depressed and having issue finding any self worth and that her life has not been the same for the last couple years. I knew what she was going through and told her I wouldn't leave her, rather I WANTED to help her cause I like her!  I eventually helped her with a favor, her repayment to me was making that first date happen...after waiting patiently for FIVE MONTHS!!!! We had our first date two Mondays ago, and it was great!  

Went to her favorite place, had wine, hung out for five hours. I got mildly intimate with her, and at one point she was receptive of it. We laughed, even started talking about another day for a second date, she goes on to show me pictures of her son and tells me how the last guy (she is divorced and was engaged to another man before he called her one day and broke it off) hurt her and son emotionally. Date ends, I walk her to her car, we chat for 15 more minutes before she leaves. I text her saying I had fun and look forward to seeing her again soon! She said me too and thank you, followed by ""was the date worth it?"" I asked her the same thing and we both said yes! I text her last Thursday to see if the second date was still on, she said yes but had to check one thing at work. I text her last Sunday.....nothing, until this Wednesday when she said had been dealing with a very serious personal matter with a friend's husband...life or death situation. I totally got it, I gave my condolences and offered my support, I didn't hear from her.  This evening rolls by and I checked in with her and said I know she has a lot going on at the moment but I'd love to see her again and would like to get together again Monday and maybe help her get away from everything for a minute, no response then.

This one hurt a lot because she was telling me all the right things for five months, I wanted to see this play out with her and after the first date, I thought I found something special!  To me, she looked like the kind of woman at my age (31) that looks past the typical things and was more interested in finding the right guy and not going off ""does he have money and looks"".  I feel totally used!  I am really hurt here and just having a tough time the last 24 hours trying to pick myself up, this tends to happen more than it should and I am really tired of feeling lonely while I see all my friends getting married, and there is me, knowing how well I would treat my woman and I just feel useless and used when I know I got so much to offer :(

I am sorry for this long post, but if you stayed with me through this, I'd love to hear some support.  I am just down in the dumps after this five month long attempt at this one woman and for it to potentially crumble without reason, and it just has me wondering, IS IT ME?! :(",dating_advice

t3_dkjkgq,"Met (M18) this girl(21) at a convention, wondering what to do next.","Hey all! posting from a throwaway (hope she isn't around here regardless)

A little background- I am a geeky, Slightly insecure guy, just out of High school and starting Uni soon. Never was in a relationship (serious or otherwise), and am trying to get into one with a girl I Like (I have high standards, too high at times).

Last Tuesday I met a really cute girl on a Science fiction convention. She was sitting alone, reading something on her phone, all quiet, disconnected from the ruckus of the convention. I Liked it, and she seamed interesting. she was waiting for some friends and after trying (and failing) to catch her eye from afar, I approached her. We spoke a little, not too deep or flirty, just a chat about the convention. After a couple of minutes I asked (and got) her Instagram account, and we followed mutually. she told me she doesn't usually give her account to strangers, And I left (in retrospect, I should have spoke with her longer and attempt getting her number and not just her Instagram, but you learn as you go I guess. Important to note, I didn't tell her back there I like her, just asked for her Instagram account.

When I got home at the evening I skimmed through her post history and grew more and more fond of her. I never really fell in love with anyone so this might be the closest I got.

the convention lasted three days and I intended to go on the first day and the last. the night before the third day I sent her a message saying we may meet tomorrow, and then immediately good night, not letting her answer (silly me).

I had some other stuff to attend to (and was kind of scared meeting her afraid to ruin a mostly good impression) so I didn't go, and at the evening she stopped following and removed my follower. the next morning, when I asked her about it she said she didn't feel comfortable with strangers following her. I told her I am sorry to hear that, because I think we are really similar, but I respect that, and I wished her luck in the future. she wished me as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing Is, she never said she doesn't like me, or doesn't want to speak to me. when she removed me she didn't block me either. I never asked her out, so, is there still a chance? or should I move on? I can think of a couple of reasons she wouldn't want me to follow her Instagram account, but will she reject an offer to go out for coffee? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I met a girl whom I like, got her Instagram account. we spoke a bit but she unfollowed and removed my follower because she didn't feel comfortable with a stranger following her.

She would always hold the gaze for about 2-3 seconds. However, she almost never initiates eye contact with me. At the same time, every time my eyes meet hers (no matter how close we are), she'll hold eye contact. This was this one time I made eye contact and she returned it, looked away, and then looked back. Also, throughout this time, she has a habit of staring out the window while listening to music while on the bus.

Hello All,

I'm currently selling my condo and living with my ex. We decided at the beginning of the year that we should separate and eventually it evolved into divorce. I took it horribly as I wasn't aware of it at the time - i was incredibly co-dependent.

I started to date maybe about a month ago and met someone amazing - we've been on 4 dates and it seemed to be going well but then realized I am still very much within my own sickness. We had plans to hang out this week but she got the flu. She's been pretty spotty with responses lately (rightfully so, she's sick duh) but my whole mental state has gone in a deep depression being super obsessive telling myself it's over, I'm an idiot for getting so attached already, how could I let myself be this vulnerable and build all theses expectations subconsciously , and seriously not able to stop thinking about her. The worst part is that I know if she reaches back out and everything is fine my depression than goes away but it's that control that I give it which makes me so fearful.

20M. I've had general confidence issues over my teen years, but I've been gymming for a year or so etc and trying to ""maintain"" my image, and I'm getting a bit better confidence wise. I have a solid group of friends, I'm openly confident and loud around them, but christ my internal thoughts are always so negative, I criticize and analyze every single comment, remark or noise I make. 

For example, I found out recently that 3 of the girls I'm friends with (3 very attractive girls) all have a thing for me. One of the girls and I tried dating for a few weeks, but some other personal stuff with her made things complex so it didn't work out, and I can't go for the other two because they're all friends.

But I can't even take the fucking compliment. I should be absolutely ecstatic that these girls all wanted me, I should be in a permanent good mood for the next 4 years, yet it made no difference to my confidence. What's worse is, whenever I'm seeing a girl or starting to see one, my mood and general wellbeing revolves around the status of that relationship. For example, for the few weeks that I was seeing that girl, every text, lack of text, or even just small behavioral irregularities (however insignificant) could flip my mood immediately, and I'd be on a downer for hours. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm not ready to date yet because I'm too emotionally dependent on the development of the relationship with the person, no matter how attracted I am to or invested in them. How can I fix this?",dating_advice
t3_dkf25c,Girl asking a guy out for coffee - does he see this as a friends thing or a date?,"Okay so I (F25) started a course around mid August this year and there‚Äôs a guy (M29) on my course that I‚Äôve liked since the moment I met him. I expected my feelings to fade/ disappear over time, but the more I talk to him the more I like him. I was getting to the point where he was mostly all I talked about, I was struggling to sleep because I was thinking about him, and the night before college when I was going to see him I felt so nervous and excited.

We have had a few one to one chats, and some group chats and get on well, with some kind of flirty jokes. I decided to text him and ask if he wanted to go for coffee so that I could know where I stand with him. I expected him to politely decline, for there to be a bit of awkwardness for a few weeks and then for me to get over him.

t3_dkic4w,Is he (23m) cheating on me and what should I (22f) do?,"Background info:
- I (22f) have been with my bf (23m) for 5 months
- We met at work when our teams had a collaboration (legal and IT)
- He had dated/had fwb arrangement with a few ladies from work before we started dating  
- I grew up in a toxic and physically/verbally abusive family where my mum had to move to Omaha from the Bay area to avoid my dad. This have contributed to my trust issue and low self esteem and i suspect i have an avoidant attachment type.

He's been hiding his phone from me recently. Yesterday I saw some girls messaging him (didn't see the content) but he snatched the phone away from me. I did not confront him (I really don't know why... perhaps I'm too scared to find out the truth? Lol)
I was visibly upset and he knew but did not try to give an explanation. 
I asked him today over text and he just brushed it off as one of his female friends I haven't met. 
To top it off, he has been showing me some Instagram posts of his female friends and keep commenting on how hot they are. I again kept quiet but was very hurt. 
Should I be worried? I'm not sure if it's just me being overly sensitive? Should I just break it off as he has other issues and I personally view the having dated/fucked around with people at work a very negative behaviour?",dating_advice

He wasn't mean about it, just stressed the importance of doing what you say you're going to do, which I agree. Well he went to visit family out of town and was gone for 2 weeks. He came back asked when would I be available, I said I can make arrangements for Saturday (I have 2 kids). He says that's fine but it would be later in the evening before he could come and didn't give an exact time. I checked in Friday to make sure we were still on, he said as far as he could see everything was a go. I meant Saturday cleaning, getting my kids ready, and myself ready. I knew it was going to be late when he got to come... he had already pre-warned me of that. I shot him a message around 8 to get an eta...  nothing.  He didn't even open it.. or at least it's showing unread. He never opened it, he didn't come and I'm a little heartbroken.  He didn't strike me as the type that would do something like this. He's very mature and responsible from what I've seen. I'm feeling very down right now. I sent him another message this morning to let him know I hope he's alright blah blah... I just don't get it. He seemed so excited to be getting to see me again. I've been single for a while so this is completely discouraging.. like why even try at this point. Advice?

t3_dkfxaf,Much needed advice for someone who is a typical overthinker and in first real relationship ever,"So I'm going to try to make this as short as possible but a little back story is needed. 

Please be kind. 

I'm 32 and I'm in a new relationship. We have been seeing each other for 1 week. I know brand new. He is older then me by 12 years. And has 3 kids (there is a reason I'm bringing this up)

I've never been in a true relationship, (that's a much longer story on why I haven't but if you want to know why I have no issue answering it.) But the short of it is I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease when I was 21. Plus I suffer from extreme anxiety until I finally got help over the last couple years. Which has helped me break out of my ""non-dating shell"". 

So with him being 44 and already having 3 kids, 2 of them already over the age of 20. I dont know if he wants to start all over again.

My question is when do I being up the question about if he would ever want more kids? 

I know it is extremely early in the relationship and it's not a 100% deal breaker if he doesn't want kids because with all my medical issues I dont even know if I can have can have kids (I've been told this by doctors and have been told we will just have to see when that time comes).

I'm really proud with myself that I finally went out with a guy. Because the last time I tried to go on a date a couple years ago I had one of my worst anxiety attacks I've ever had. I'm better now, working with my doctors and on meds that help. But I want kids or at least try. If my body doesn't allow me to have kids I can live with that. I have nieces and nephews that I can spoil and love like if they were my own. But I dont want to fall for a guy (which I really like him, we have so much in common and he takes me for me) if he doesn't want more kids. 

So how long do I wait? Neither of us are getting younger and with my health issues it could take longer for me to get pregnant.

The most recent examples come from the man I‚Äôve been dating for two months. After about a month, he told me he had a surprise gift for me and wanted to bring it to me. I was going abroad for a business trip and told him that he can bring it to our meeting after I come back.

He did pretty much the same thing a month later with my birthday gift.

During one of our conversations, I mentioned that my birthday was getting near. He asked about the specific date and asked me what I would like. Then he said that I will get my gift. We met two days after my birthday for brunch and he brought nothing. Nor did he mention anything about what happened to that gift.

We hug to say hello and good bye, but he hasn't tried to touch me or kiss me or anything.  There have been plenty of opportunities, but every hour we've spent together so far has felt very platonic.

I took his jacket because I was cold and for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to sit on his lap. I did and sat there for hours while we held hands and he literally hugged me. We had garlic bread and laughed and chatted and at some point we were really close to kissing. I ""stole"" his phone playfully and we fought over it and it was all very physical and quite close. Then he sent me to bed because I was drunk and spent a few minutes making sure I am sleeping because I kept rushing to him to annoy him again.


I woke up now and I am soo embarrassed I don't know what to say or do.

I also had to work and put myself thru college, so dating was not something I was able to do for a while because I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in a position to do it. 

For the last 5 or 6 years, I‚Äôve been in an ideal position to date and meet someone. I have a good job with a lot of flexibility and a decent income, live in a nice place, travel often. However, it‚Äôs has been one bad experience after the other. I‚Äôve tried online dating. And that has been simply terrible. For the last 5 years I haven‚Äôt been with anyone long enough to even introduce them to my family or even celebrate any holiday with a special someone. 

My family and friends think that I have a secret dating life and don‚Äôt want to bring anyone home, but the true is that I don‚Äôt date anyone long enough to be appropriate to bring them home. 

Any advice?",dating_advice

t3_dk55kq,"Hurt, confused, and weirded out by someone I am seeing","I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I was subjected to the weirdest and painful three days by a girl I love and am dating. 

I have kids and an ex wife with whom I co-parent our children in the same roof, where I visit and stay with them once every 6 weeks. The ex, in a fit of unexplainable rage, called my girlfriend and told her that we were in fact married, contrary to the facts. She also shared some of the things she overhead me say in order to gain the trust of my gf. Hooked by bits of accurate info, my gf fell for mountains of crap that she was fed by my ex. She kept asking me to prove that the 90 percent of the garbage she was fed was untrue. 

Being so in love and not seeing how ridiculous it was, I gave her the phone numbers of three of my closest friends. They talked and told her everything. One of them was very helpful, and talked to her as a woman and tried to reason with her. 

Then the weirdest things started: she called my ex, narrated exactly what my friends said, and gave the ex the phone number of my friends. She also told the ex about what I told her in our most intimate times, and how vulnerable I was with her. It's worth mentioning that I shared my deepest  and most closely held memories with her. After finding out about how she breached my trust and shared some things with the ex, I had a mini panic attack, that she might not only share what I told her, but also share some of the emotionally vulnerable messages that I sent her. 

This is a person with whom I had imagined my whole future with, so it really hurt me knowing that what we said to one another in private would be used in a petty manner to brag to my ex that I was vulnerable to her. 

One of my friends gave me the best advice, which is to never set my bar low enough that I would have to try to appease a woman who takes someone else's words over mine, and is not trustable with personal information. However, my rational mind is inactive at the moment, and that's why I came here. Just writing this made me see how much I tried, and that I gave away too much to someone who is probably emotionally immature, but wrongly sees themselves -- and made me see them -- as emotionally stable. 

Any word of advice and fresh eyes would be super helpful to me. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",dating_advice

t3_dkgyjp,"Last night, I was broken. Help me","It has been a long past year. Lots of hookups, getting off... My game is impeccable. I'm young, attractive, confident and do a martial art for sport.

2 weeks ago I met a girl... Ever since then I've not talked to anyone else. This is far from being typical of me, I usually always have 10+ girls messaging me, which I reply to slowly and whenever I feel like it. I don't like anyone, and I don't allow myself to like anyone.

With this girl, I clicked... I clicked so much. Everything made me fall for her and I fell hard, I let her in like I'd not done in so long and my feelings for her grew exponentially. Luckily for me, the same was happening to her. The first night we met at the club we kissed, but we agreed to get to know each other so we did. We talked days and days and met multiple times on dates.

Fast forward to Thursday. I went out at night and ended up at her flat, went into her room and was cuddling her. Nothing sexual, we were tired and my goal was just to spend time with her. Her flat mates were making a lot of noise, so she got up to talk to them. 5 minutes later, a friend of mine comes in the room and tells me to leave because she asked him to get me out of her room. I was so annoyed at this because she has been playing games for the past week (I would know, considering the plethora of girls I've spoken to) and so logged out of Snapchat and decided to not talk to anyone for a couple of days.

Apparently she double texted me on Friday.

On Saturday I went out and saw her and told her ""I'm upset at you"". Whilst talking she admitted she was extremely annoyed at me for not replying to her text. I apologised and proceeded to show her I've not been on Snapchat (and showed her unopened texts from 2 days ago). Then, she kept on drinking and told me she didn't want to be with me that night, but to meet her at her place later after it so we can sort things out.

Okay, makes sense. But she kept drinking. And as the night went forward she made out with a guy in front of me. As I saw this I left the club. My heart was broken, I was sad.

When she got out i was sat with her flat mate and she was with the guy. I held her arm and pulled her and asked to speak to her. The guy immediately comes over in super protective mode and tells me to not touch her, thankfully I'm relaxed in conflicting situations, but considering I had drunk I'm surprised I didn't completely fuck him up (I have done martial arts for 9 years, aggressive/offensive ones). I told him to chill and let me talk to her. I asked her why. She said she didn't know, she was upset at me for not replying.

Then I talked to the guy, told him what was up, and he said ""look I'm still gonna make my move, sorry bro"".

Her friends told me she likes me, even if she has a hard time admitting to it. She then went back with the guy to his room, I don't know what they did. I just know I went home, completely broken. I have slept 4h.

I removed her on Snapchat, but I doubt she will try to text. She will move on, possibly with him if he wasnt just using her for sex. I don't want to go to Uni on Monday but I have a full day and can't miss out on it. 

My heart beats awfully and my stomach is turned. I know time will heal me, but I am upset. I was finally ready to commit. Finally ready to stop fucking around meaningless women and engage in something that makes me happy and sad and feeling something. And I let her in, and she broke me.",dating_advice

Even college, recently I got stood up and the girl flaked on the reschedule (second date). I saw again her after a few weeks unexpectedly  but she was being rude/ignoring me which didn't make any sense for her to be like that? I feel stupid now how she acted or was bipolary interested.

I know that I may lack social skills but I met girls that their boyfriends are quiet and don't talk much so Idk how they do it.

Either way I dont how I can attract women more, I honestly don't know man! I mean I do photography, sports I play basketball and soccer competitively ( on a team ) I play the guitar I mean what else dude.

Sorry this is going to be a very long post. Long time lurker, first time posting also this is from my phone.

I am a (22M) and kinda have this problem with a girl I am with.
We had history together, she was the first person to make me feel soo loved that I fell in love with her about a month from meeting her. Things let to others and all the good emotions have turned to hate because she didn‚Äôt know if we wanted to be a couple or not. Last excuses used were that she was depressed and that her parents didn‚Äôt want her to hang with me.

 A year has passed after me playing it cool,she was chasing after me and giving me loads of attention. She has told me that she wants to be friends, best friends and hopefully a couple. Saying that after admitting to hurting me with her actions although she did not mean it.I told her we can try but I still do not trust her. 

Things go smoothly for awhile, we hung out after that for a month and a half. Then came the her sister‚Äôs wedding which took 3 weeks of heavy duty work from her to be done. I stayed supportive and told her that I can take her out so that she can freshen up a bit from all the work.  She keeps blowing off the hang outs by telling me again that she is depressed from her sister leaving home not only that but because she can‚Äôt study and is having a hard time at the university since midterms are a week away. I was understanding but after the second and third time I thought this is just like the year before and started ghosting a bit and not answering to much and of course not initiating any outings. 

Called a friend (F) of hers that seem to care about her and she told me she has been sad for a while but does not tell anyone why. I am confused about her, I want to believe that she is depressed and will come around for me but at the same time I feel that she does not consider me as a priority and that I should move on. I feel that She is my first love but at the same time I don‚Äôt want ending up hurting like the first time.",dating_advice

I‚Äôm definitely attracted to men, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. But sometimes seeing other women kiss really turns me on, but more than that there‚Äôs this longing for an experience like that, idk, how do I know if it‚Äôs real? 

Also, I‚Äôve never even flirted with a girl, how do I even start to explore this part of me?

We were only supposed to be friends.. but we kissed once I told him it was a mistake and he ended up having a gf. Twice I stayed until 3 am hanging with him I saw him 5x total. Then with another one..I went to an Airbnb we just got in the pool. I also ended up meeting my ex (my only sexual partner) at a hotel and we ended up having sex &amp; it was after a year since I ended things ..then it turned out that I ended up finding out he still was with the girl he started dating after me.

I‚Äôve always been a good girl and I know I only had sex with the same person but I feel terrible.

During August we stopped seeing each other BC she dated someone else, which was a bummer. I told her I didn't like it but ok. Then late Sept she saw me at an event, wasn't able to say hi, and texted me. We start talking again, she's single. Chatting a lot that weekend then she comes over and stays the night. We have a good time, I text her later the next day ""good to see u hope u got home safe"" and she replied had lots of fun, short chat. Next day I text her a meme and we chat for a little bit. Then the next week I message her to see if she wants to meet up before in outta town for a bit, she says she's busy w school &amp; parents coming in town (all friendly). Im like ok nw, I get back mid next week wanna meet up then? She says ya got a bunch of mid terms next week but if I get a gap I'll lyk. I reply sounds good , good luck on ur tests. All good so far.

Then I did something crazy. I fucked up hard.

A week after we texted about possibly meeting up I outta the fucking blue ask if she could send me some of the dirty pics (not nudes but ya know) she sent me before as they are all on a fried phone. So desperate, creepy, and thirsty I cannot stop cringing. She never responded. I thought about apologizing but didn't cuz I wanna give her her space and stop being too much. Im reeking of thirst already. 

Do you think that she's done for good? I was planning on  giving her as much space as possible . How crazy was my actions ? Idk what to do I really want to keep casually seeing her the sex is so hot.

t3_dke8uu,A girl (25F) kissed me on the first date but not the second,"Hello, I just had my second date with a girl I really like and I'm very confused as to whether she likes me or not. We matched on bumble and went out together last night. We had dinner and then went to a bar and then a jazz club last night. We were sitting together on the couch at the jazz club and pretty close to each other and I kept finding myself just staring into her eyes and decided to kiss her one time. She turned her cheek and then a few seconds later awkwardly turned back around and kissed me. We kissed a few more times that night and she also gave me a peck kiss goodbye at the end. Today we had another date, and it seemed like it went well but she didn't give me a kiss at all. I tried to ask her for one as she left but she just said bye. We discussed having another date soon but didn't make plans for it yet. She texted me right after and said thanks for today. So I'm a bit confused as to whether she likes me or not. It seemed that we had broken the ice of kissing on the first date and that if she liked me I would think at least she would give me a peck goodbye but she didn't. She seems a little closed off and not easy to open up. So I am wondering if maybe she kissed me the first night maybe only because some alcohol was involved and we had been sitting together on the couch together for a while so we were closer. The fact she turned her head away at first but then came back makes me wonder if she was closed off and didn't want to but then changed her mind and felt bad or something, I dont really know. We haven't set up a third date yet but she is busy tomorrow, and then isn't sure how things will be with work but said we will talk and we started to make a plan for next weekend and said we could do something during the week too. I am just kind of freaking out wondering whether she likes me and is just waiting to open up, but it is confusing because she opened up enough to kiss me several times last night, but maybe only cause alcohol was involved? No idea. But also I'm wondering if maybe she just decided today that she just wants to be friends or isn't really interested. I dont really know what to think or do at all and I really like her and feel like I'm just going to be super confused until we hang out again or she says she doesn't want to. Any advice would be appreciated as I went from having a great day with her to mow being extremely confused and not sure whether I should think she still likes me or not or move on or wait and see or what!!!

t3_dkg9jy,I [28F] am having a difficult time with this man [30M] and need some advice,"Or maybe I don‚Äôt need any advice. Basically I‚Äôm hung up on a guy who approached me first in springtime. We were hanging out but I was really shy, I take a while to open up. I do regret holding back how I felt, I liked him A LOT and I didn‚Äôt want to come off as too strong. 

He‚Äôs not so emotionally available and I don‚Äôt want to come off as asking too many personal questions, leading him to back off. But in general he seems very aloof and doesn‚Äôt know what he wants. 

But I do know what I want. I want him. I have been on dates, and I can‚Äôt get him out of my head. After one date I called my friend and briefly told her how it went tonight and then was just talking mostly about this guy that I can‚Äôt seem to get over. 

I want him to like meeeeeeeee. But obviously I can‚Äôt force it. When I see a guy is too into me I don‚Äôt like it. So I want to approach it in a way that doesn‚Äôt show I‚Äôm too into him? Or just forget him and if I ever bump into him, then talk?? occasionally we see each other at the same social events but it‚Äôs gonna be rare coming into the winter. 

Our chemistry was really nice in the beginning but I don‚Äôt know it started to get distant. I noticed it and said to him that he seemed off and he told me someone else told him this too. (That he seemed ‚Äúoff‚Äù) Maybe he‚Äôs going through things. But I just want to see him happy and be in his life.

I‚Äôve dated non- US citizens before  and I always ask up front if they plan on staying in the US or if they‚Äôre here for school with plans to go back.

(28, m) sorry for the formatting and wall of text... mobile, here. I should start by saying, it's not really a self esteem issue. I promise, I actually put a lot of time into myself. I do have social anxiety in largish groups, depression, and I have sexual anxiety. (As in I get hella awkward when it comes to anything sexual, due to a lack of experience. I'm usually comfortable, but they're usually not) That and I just dont connect with people, especially on that level. I'll be engaged and listen intently, but no one really opens up to me and as soon as I do, they usually withdraw. It kinda makes me feel like a creep and needy/ desperate, when all I'm trying to do, is connect with someone. I just feel like, at that point, they're probably better off with someone else, even if theres some degree of mutual interest. I'm not going to bend over backwards, just to make something work. I've been on some dates, but I've been single for 10+ years. Its getting to the point where i feel like dating is more of just a chore, with no reward. Actually to the point where its depressing, tbh... (I think loneliness is the main source of my depression) I approach dating as, you should be happy and content with yourself (and I am) and so should they. You shouldn't be looking for validation, getting laid or anything. (not that theres anything wrong with that, per se. Some people want that and its mutual and that's cool, just not for me.) Dating, for me, should be about mutual companionship. Like complementing each others personalities and interests. I'm starting to feel like I lack what it takes. Like when there actually is something there, they deserve something better. Someone with more experience and without depression, ect.. because there will be times when I'm half a functioning adult. Someone that could contribute on more fronts than me. I dont expect anyone to pick me up, when I'm feeling down or anything... but I can't be full force all of the time.",dating_advice

t3_dkc1ny,How to not date online when you live in a very ‚Äúclosed off‚Äù city,"22 (F) looking for advice 


So, here‚Äôs a dilemma: I live in a really big city ( really. Big.) which is cool! You get to see a lot of interesting/ different ( and attractive ) people, but finding people who are up to get to meet each other is very hard to find, at least irl. ( and I get it, not everyone here is friendly and talking to strangers can lead to terrible things most of the time, there is a lot of crazy people out there ) 

Online dating apps are sort of meh, you will either find the crazy people, meaningless hookups, or just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù profiles. Personally speaking it‚Äôs hard for me to like someone, even with the visual appeals, if their personality isn‚Äôt nice I won‚Äôt stay for long. So actual 1 on 1 conversation is ideal for me to get someone better. how will I get to meet someone if irl people are so closed off, and the online ones aren‚Äôt willing to be honest about themselfs? Or are just looking for something ‚Äúcasual‚Äù ( which it isn‚Äôt my case)",dating_advice

t3_dkfthy,How do you tell what's keeping you single?,"It's 2AM so maybe I'll leave this to therapy, but I'm back on it with my self-loathing bullshit though thankfully not to the worse extremes. I found out I am now the only single and the biggest loser in all my friend groups. I'm working on the loser aspect- I go to therapy, I am driving again and released from concussion rest so I'm in the gym again, I'm in college and trying to save my grades and find a different major if I do fail this semester. I'm writing or trying to and trying to find time to make furniture to sell. 

But the single aspect, that kills me. I've been trying to build a better support network for the last three years when I was told normal people have at least one good friend. So I suck at people skills in general. I don't have any friends I can ask about this, as they either haven't known me long enough or have complicated backgrounds with- one of my closest friends is my ex, ffs, I don't want to be the dude that calls the girl after she's flaunting a new boyfriend around and be like ""Why, Lisa, Why??"".

 I want to know how to improve myself, why can't I get a girlfriend or keep one? My ex said she wanted to break up just to work on herself, and we ended up- I want to say dating but I think I was just a human body pillow. I hate myself for letting myself fall for it. She never once will tell me what I did wrong; all I can think is maybe our views on religion didn't work out and my usual insecurities over my eye disease or lack of any income or stable future. 

My other ex said basically the same thing, it was her, not me, but that was two years ago. Ya, I don't date often, and years go by in the mean time. I think the eye disease thing started here as it was two weeks after I told her it's not just colorblindness and could turn into a disability. 

So... How do I find my toxic traits, what's keeping me from getting friends and a girlfriend, or am I just not social enough to run into girls? Am I too ugly, too undesirable... I rarely go out, I go to clubs and classes and that's about it.

Suddenly she changed her behavior (texting wise) after a video call, and we've called a few times so it was normal. In this particular call, I'm shown a list of guys that she likes a lot and I'm on there. She tells me that my only con is I live far away then again it's an hour away and I'm a licensed driver with a job and my family's support so I didn't know how that was an issue. She agreed to some plans that I made a few days before her behavior change, and has decided to flake out. What's crazy is I've taken her places like ""dates"" but not exactly, except every sign was there, holding hands, lovey dovey comments, all that jazz. To get to the point, I don't know how to interpret this person distancing themself by leaving me confused with very simple yes or no questions, like usual conversation starters. What seemed like a person who loved the attention and even seemed to give some back, has decided that attention, which was a conserved amount on my part, is no longer of importance or worth her time.

She‚Äôs really really shy, at least over text. She can sometimes come across as dismissive or uninterested with one word replies, but that‚Äôs just her nature really.

t3_dk8sfe,Anyone else had trouble getting over their first crush after a breakup?,"I [23 F] finally got back in the dating game after breaking up with the man I almost got engaged to last winter. 

I met a guy [26 M] on Bumble, and we hit it off right away. We quickly scheduled a date that went so well we ended up staying for hours longer than expected. After that we went on dates and hung out every few days. That lasted for around three weeks. I thought things were going well because he deleted his Bumble account, so I ended up doing the same. 

The last time I saw him we tentatively made plans for a few days later. He then cancelled because he was tired, and I didn‚Äôt think anything of it since I had cancelled in the past for the same thing. After that our communication went downhill. He would still respond to messages, but I felt like I was the one making most of the effort. I didn‚Äôt hear from him for a few days and started to get worried. He then apologized and we went back to talking normally. 

I decided to ask if we could see each other sometime that week. He simply responded ‚ÄúNot this week, it‚Äôs been rough‚Äù. I responded with ‚ÄúHope your week gets better, let me know if you ever want to hang out again‚Äù. He then responded with ‚ÄúThanks, I‚Äôll let ya know‚Äù.

This may be long. I apologize. A year ago, meet guy at airport. Said guy is going overseas for work for 8 months. Keep in touch everyday, getting to know one another and developing a friendship. Admittedly, I develop feelings and start romanticizing the idea of a relationship. I stop seeing other people and decide I would like to focus on this and give it a fair chance. I foolishly made that known. 

Fast forward to his return, spend a great weekend together (we live 6 hours away from one another) he tells me he isn‚Äôt talking to or seeing anyone else (which he later admits he said to me because he felt pressured because I told him I wasn‚Äôt dating anyone) and we agree we‚Äôd like to continue taking it slow and see where it goes.  I‚Äôm feeling hopeful and excited and really feel like I‚Äôm liking this guy and it could be something special. 

After I return home, he admits he had a one night stand a few days after our weekend together. That hurt, granted we weren‚Äôt exclusive. Then a few days later when he‚Äôs en route to his home state, he vaguely admits he‚Äôs conflicted about his long term ex and still has unresolved feelings.

He ends it with her and tells me he wants to proceed with me. So we do, and shortly after become exclusive.  He went above and beyond to make things right, as I was upset and felt mislead and like he lied. 

Here is where it gets tricky. I‚Äôve never been able to let go. I haven‚Äôt been able to trust him. And our relationship has been very poor. I feel insecure, jealous and inadequate. Come to find out, he always kept that ex on the back burner because of their history, and he admitted he was unsure if after what he did... if I would leave him. So he platonically kept the door open, even though she continuously expressed her feelings to him. I will admit I have been difficult, mistrustful, accusatory, jealous and over bearing. I want to stop. But don‚Äôt know how to let go and trust. 

I‚Äôm not comfortable with her being in his life after all the damage, and knowing she has feelings for him and goes out of her way to tell him. It makes me feel disrespected and he doesn‚Äôt do anything about it. Which is spineless. I have ended things because of the lying, and feeling like he can‚Äôt let go of his past.

t3_dkeq46,Is it even possible for me to have a dating life right now?,"Hi, 


I crashed on my motorcycle a couple of weeks ago.

I didn't have a dating life (or even a social life outside of work) before I crashed but I was getting ready to try to have one. I was planning on moving out of my parents house this month but now I can't.


I'm a 20 year old male. Is there any way I could even try dating? I can't really go anywhere because I can't walk or drive because of my knees (torn ligaments and knee fractures) and my left arm is in a cast (fractured wrist)


I know it's probably a stupid question but I'm just really lonely right now. I was already  super lonely before I crashed but now it's even worse because I sit at home all day doing nothing with nobody to talk to because I have 0 friends and haven't ever had a girlfriend.",dating_advice
t3_dk9830,When do you hang boots?,"I suppose I am at that phase where hope is amusing. I have been thinking long on this, pretty much the entire year now, but I think I have to now make peace with the fact that I'm ending up alone. How does one become okay with that?

It's not the worst idea; certainly better than facing the reality that I'm going to be jobless. 
Thank fuck, I wasn't dependent on another person to make that happen for myself. 

In purely statistical terms, there's hope insofar as we find someone purely as chance at any given point in our lives but when you're actively sitting tight and doing nothing about changing your situation or seeing people, is it time to bid hope? And if so, how do you make peace with it?

t3_dk86j3,lost on what to do,"I'm trying to figure out how to handle my current situation as currently it's not going well. in basic me (24m) and my wife (28f) (of 5 years) are in a bit of a rough patch due to her ideology and acts. A few months back I caught her flirting with multiple people online and in person even had the guts the do it in person with someone she claimed was only a friend. once the truth was out I ask her to stop, because my opinion on the matter is flirting is cheating because it opens the doors to further things, she refused and has continued but has been more secretive about it. 

she's changed passwords deleted messages the whole 9 yards or someone hiding things. not to mention over the past year or so has been a dead spot as far as bedroom and conversation despite my efforts to change things. I've poured everything I have into the relationship I changed my ways and my job to better our situation and provide for my bio daughter and step daughter. 

I'm at a loss on what to do I don't want to give things up and I want to make things work but it seems like no matter what I do its not working. and I honestly can't tell if she still feels the same way that she did and talking to her about it is a mute point as her immediate response is to get angry and yell even when I approach the subject calmly. if anyone could give incite it'd be greatly appreciated.

t3_dk80gm,[20/M] I think was rude to a girl I like [20/F]. Should I Apologize? How do you apologize to people?,"TL;DR: Should I Apologize? How do you apologize to people?

I have a crush on a girl at my college*, but at some point I must have been annoying (or creepy?). I didn't realize till later. She didn't complain or tell me anything. She blocked me on social media.I think she was less friendly, but I'm not sure.

One issue is, I don't know what I did specifically. It wasn't a direct insult or perverted remark. I think it was probably how I said something or the context. I think the term is microaggression. IDK.

My first solution is to avoid her and never talk to her again. Hasn't required effort yet. It's been nearly 2 weeks, since I last saw her.

The problem is that both of us probably will be helping out at school events. I don't know if I should quit (and avoid her), or stay. Should I act like I don't know her?

Should I apologize if I see her? How do you apologize to people? How do I know what to say sorry for? How I do know not to repeat the same mistake? All I can think of is, don't blame people for your mistakes, keep distance, and don't block exits.

t3_dk2sp6,Good first date Ideas.,"  

**Planning a date is frustrating and stressful at times. So, don‚Äôt try to reinvent the wheel, you have plenty of resources you can use. In fact, I‚Äôve created a list of what I recommend going on in the early stages of the dating process. The first few dates are meant to be a fun and casual experience with the purpose of getting to know a person and develop chemistry through interaction and time, that‚Äôs is why people tell you a movie is a bad first date.**

**Drinks/Coffee/smoothie dates** ‚Äì Though I didn‚Äôt want to put this one on the list because I personally am biased against these types of dates, however, they do work for a number of people. This date is meant for people who don‚Äôt know much about each other and want to sit down face to face to converse at a low cost.

Pros: low budget $10 to $15, a quick meet and greet, causal, no-stress environment, the opportunity for good conversation

Cons: not a very exciting, could be seen as a lack of effort or interest, 

**Walkthrough the park/hiking** ‚Äì a walk through the park to me is a step up from the coffee date because you have a slight activity. This gives you the opportunity to show your date around town and possibility see something they might not have seen otherwise or at the very least get to move around. 

Pros: low budget $0 to $15, a quick meet and greet, causal no-stress environment, opportunity for good conversation, able to be active and move around

Cons: potential bad weather, allergies,  

**Billiards/Pool** ‚Äì is a game that most people are not a pro at and you can have fun, laugh, and even do light teasing while playing. For this reason, it opens people up and is a good ice breaker. A table can usually be found in most bars, bowling alleys, and pool halls.

Pros: mid-cost budget $15 to $25, no stress environment, the opportunity for good conversation, fun activity, acts as an ice breaker, 

Cons: a lot of places with pool tables usually allow smoking, not enough tables available, 

**Geocaching** \- is an activity in which you use a Global Positioning System on your mobile device and other navigational techniques to find containers called ""geocaches"" or ""caches"" at specific locations marked by coordinates. It‚Äôs basically an outdoor treasure hunting game where you are looking for containers that people have hidden, all you have to do is google it, download the app, and play. 

Pros: low budget $0 to $20, good opportunity for conversation, it an engaging activity so you can see how you collaborate together when finding these items

Cons: same as any outdoor activity, allergies,  bad weather, 

**A Museum** ‚Äì is a perfect date if there is an exabit you enjoy or look forward to. It gives you the opportunity to teach your date about something that interests you. This lets your date get to know you on a more personal level because they get to see a side of you, they wouldn‚Äôt get to see until farther down the road.

Pros: you don‚Äôt have to worry about the weather, it is a natural ice breaker because the subject is handed to you literally.

Cons: average out to be $25 per persons, finding a museum you enjoy, 

**Rock climbing/Bouldering** ‚Äì Is a sporty activity that allows us to climb around making us like kids on a jungle gym or challenging our athletic ability.  Regardless of your mindset rocking is fun if you and your date enjoy being an activity or trying new things. If you feel unease because you have never been there are classes you can take that will teach you the correct way to belay or spot your partner.

Pros: building trust, engaging activity, mid-cost budget about $40 for two people,

Cons: you will get sweaty, you‚Äôre not going to look as cute, not as much opportunity as to talk,  

**Taking a Class** ‚Äì of any kind is another interactive activity where you are being guided through a process by a teacher. I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt need me to explain that but taking your date to a class offers you a simple activity that is put together by other people. It also gives you leeway on your conversation because you will have to focus on the task at hand.

Pros: if you are shy it gives you a bit of space between conversations, little to no planning involved, get to learn something new, there are many different class options,

Cons: the main focus is on the class, not the conversation, class cost vary, 

**Personal one of my favorite first dates is Creating Tie-dye t-shirts** \- I understand, they seem lame when you first hear it as a date. However, hear me out before you judge it so quickly. This is a unique, cute, and cost-effective date that gives you a small activity, that allows for a lot of conversation. When thinking of dates in general no one is thinking if Tie-dye t-shirts and this will make you stand out from other people. also, your date gets to take home a souvenir that will remind them of the date. 

Pros: cost-effective ranging $20 to $30 bucks, allows for good conversations, the date gets to take home a reminder of the date.

Cons: it‚Äôs not the typical date, you don‚Äôt want to wear your best clothes, 

**Karaoke** ‚Äì is a good energic feel-good atmosphere date. Music is already known to create and change people‚Äôs moods and even if you are not good at singing the majority of people are terrible at karaoke. If you are an okay or bad singer that is fine, have fun and act silly, by acting silly you‚Äôll make your date comfortable and laugh. Laughter has always led to good positive vibes and that is exactly what you want to do during a date.

Pros: it creates positive vibes, your only goals are to make your date laugh, have a good time, and get to know them between songs, 

Cons:  if your date dislikes singing, this will turn the date upside down but that is why you mention it before going, most people also have the Mindset that this date is only for aren‚Äôtgroup dates which isn‚Äôt the case.

**Splatter Paint date** ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt know what a splatter date, it‚Äôs simply throwing paint at a blank canvas in an abstract way. What you‚Äôll need to buy is environmentally friendly paint, a blank canvas, and some ponchos, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs a creative date, similar to the tie-dye t-shirts and allows you to be a bit more playful by throwing paint not only at the canvas but at each other. 

Pros: isn‚Äôt location-specific, fairly cheap, shouldn‚Äôt be stressful, and allows for a bit of physical flirting by throwing paint at each other, 

Cons: messy, a lot of items to keep track of, 

**A Picnic** ‚Äì Yeah, I said it, and it might be a bit clich√© when talked about but a large number of people have yet to go on one. A picnic is a sweet date, cheap, and easy date to go on. All you have to do is create a couple of food items like sandwiches, mixed fruit bowl, and some drinks and you are basically all yet. You have a conversation while you eat outside in the park.

Pros: a relaxing date, has a price point of whatever you set it as, as a sweet side to it

Cons: not a date that can happen in the cold or rain,",dating_advice

t3_dk7mud,I just need some advice on this,"Hi this is my first post so I'm kind of nervous. I love my girlfriend to death, she was the first person I've ever had a crush on. We met last year around this time, both our freshman year of college. I am also a female so back at that point I was in denial that I would have a crush on another girl. 

The beginning of our relationship was rocky because of a friendship I had with someone I thought was a quality person. Long story short, she didnt like that I was dating someone in general (it wasnt anything homophobic she just didnt like that I was interested/dating someone idk I didnt understand it either). I would keep telling her that once she got to know my girlfriend that shed warm up to her so I'd invite my girlfriend to come hang out with my friend group or study with us. My friend would always react in a distant/moody way and ultimately get up and leave in the middle of it. She thought I was replacing her as a person in my life so I began to designate time I'd spend with her and my girlfriend. The rest of my group was fine with my girlfriend, they enjoyed hanging out with her. 

Eventually the girl I was friends with dropped me as a friend which made the others do the same. 
Since then my girlfriend has always acted weird when I would talk to people or interact with people she hasnt met before. I understand because of what happened at the beginning, even though it wasnt my doing, she has admitted she still associates what had happened to me which is why she feels weird in situations like that. I dont know what to do to keep her at ease and we have talked about this so many times and I feel bad for what I had put her through with what happened at the beginning of our relationship but it wasnt my fault and I dont know how to have her change her thought process with that whole association thing. I really need advice on this because it's gotten to a point where I recently hugged a friend because she told me something sad that happened to her over the weekend and my girlfriend saw me do that and got upset. She knows and admits her reaction shouldnt be that way but I know it's only because of the association she still has with me. I just need advice on how to help her snap out of it.

Aside from that, my girlfriend is also very quick to react to things. It isnt a bad thing like everyone gets upset over things. I'm just used to internalizing it because I'm more of an ""it is what it is"" kind of person. So I also dont know how to deal with her whenever she gets in a mood. I'm also very empathetic and hyper aware when people around me seem off so I know I take it to heart when her reaction has nothing to do with something about me. I just want to help her out. I know that everyone reacts to things in a different way so I guess I'm posting this for advice as to how I deal with it without taking it to heart and being frustrated with how she reacts to things? 

It'll be a year of our relationship in November if this helps in any way. She truly is the first person I have ever had feelings for and I just want what is best for her. She also helped me come to terms with myself and she has met my family and friends back at home. Now at school she and her roommate are the only people I really hang out with as a ""group"" but I do have others I talk to just not hang out with constantly.",dating_advice

t3_dkdwao,FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS WITH SOMEONE WHO IS GETTING DIVORCED?,"Hi brief context, I'm a 21 years old female who was kinda new in this city so I resorted to dating apps to be able to have somebody go out and explore the city with me since I don't know any ways on how to meet new girl-friends or potential boy-friends.  
A month after being in that app I met someone 10+ years older than me and on our first date he fully disclosed to me that he is not looking for a relationship &amp; that he is not in the position to be in a relationship so we decided to be in a friends with benefits situation since I don't think being in a relationship is wise for me to do too. 2 months in that exclusive friends with benefits I asked him if he secretly has kids/ a wife because of our age difference and only then he told me he in fact do have a wife back in his country but things are complicated with them at the moment and he is working towards divorcing her it's just that the culture they have is very conservative and their families aren't really supporting his decision on divorcing her. At first I was really conflicted because I've never been caught up with this kind of situation and mostly my friends with benefits partners in the past were definitely not committed to anybody else but were just emotionally unavailable. Eventually I've decided to be selfish and to enjoy it while it last. However, as months pass by we started to talk less about his situation with his wife but we still talked about other things, about his goals or his family or what he still wants to achieve in life. A lot of times I tried ending it with him because he wasn't giving me much attention, I would see different girls messaging him and he would tell me that they're just friends or co-workers and that those girls actually do have a boyfriend, a tinder notification and a lot of things which he was able to justify before. Now we're trying to be friends with benefits again but exclusively just us and no tinder and no talking to other girls either and he agreed but the dynamic between us are really different now. We text less, we don't do phone calls anymore but we talk a lot in person. I would bring up the the girl's name in the past and ask him what happened to them and why haven't they been in touch with him anymore since I don't see any notifications in his phone with their name in it unlike before and he would just shrug it off and tell me that those people are buried in the past now and that we shouldn't be talking about them anymore. Anyways, I have developed feelings for this guy and he is actually a nice and cool person. He taught me a lot of things and I genuinely like him as a person but I fear that I am becoming a doormat that I am just settling or is he just really playing me? He actually told me that he purposefully ignore my texts and calls because he doesn't want to be in a relationship and that I actually deserve better and that is something that he could not give. Does this mean I should not pursue it and just protect my heart? Does this mean I should just let go? My therapist told me to just think of him more of a fuck buddy or a friend with no benefits, no in betweens. Should I follow it? As a man, does this mean I mean nothing to him?

So we met on Hinge and we really hit it off, chatted for a while, and had a really fun first date where the conversation really clicked. The next day we went on a second date which also went really well; we spent around 7 hours together talking and enjoying each other's company and he sent me off with a kiss which was nice. After the second date, we texted all day every day and ended up making plans for a third date. I found him really funny and cute and was full of butterflies and all that, and then we went on our third date and it was very... okay.
We chitchatted but there was a lot more dead space than there had been, and for some reason it was a little awkward. Conversation at dinner was still fun (esp after we'd had a couple drinks), and then we talked some more, but he felt kinda distant. When it was time to go I wondered if he was gonna invite me in to his place or anything, but it was very much like ""thanks for the evening! good night."" and then I went home.
Now we haven't really texted at all (just a couple but the conversation is crumbs) and there have been no hints or attempts at talking about another date.

I'm very new to online dating and ""adult"" dating and honestly dating in general, so I was wondering if anyone had any insight into this? Should I keep trying to talk to him or should I just let it go and move on? I really liked him a lot but I tend to lose feelings if I feel like someone doesn't like me as much as I like them.

\*THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG AND IMMATURE STORY

&amp;#x200B;

In this new semester of study (2 months ago), i started talking with her because we were friends for about a year and because we are in the same class , I started to like her because she saw me renewed (i talked to many girls, had good grades and i helped her with work).

1 month ago we were invited to a small party, we went and she was very close to me, thanks to a party challenge we gave each other a quick kiss. After that night we started talking in a different way ,  the worst happened 1 week later, there was another party and I didnt go, she went and kissed an unknown guy and a girl (WITHOUT ASK ) because of the same sort of challenge , at 3:00am she texted me that i was an  hypocrate for not going to that party . 

I got mad and a girl (who is very sexually interested in me) gave me a blowjob while she was looking (I did it for revenge and because I thought she didn't want to be with me ) . The things just got worse and we both ignore each other for several days , one day i swallowed my pride and talk to her and tell her that I was sorry, that I liked her a lot and that I wanted to try a relationship with her , the only thing that she said was  that if i do it for revenge and  i said yes , she ignored me for 2 days and at that time a mutual friend told me that she was not going to be with me because Im resentful .

After that we talked again after 1 week and she kind of gave me a second chance but I just couldn't go on after what I heard. (she obviously doesn't know that I know that)  .

&amp;#x200B;

i understand that i did something horrible to her but she started everything  with his immature and childish attitude .

I‚Äôve been in love before in an 11 month relationship which ended over a year ago. Anyway, this guy is honestly perfect. He is always looking for my best interests, makes me candlelit dinners and just absolutely adores me. 

We‚Äôve been together all day everyday the past 3 weeks studying together and hanging out and just the feelings all developed quickly. Is this too early?

t3_dkco7o,I'm so conflicted and I feel just sick,"There is a guy I have been dating for a little while now online. He is just amazing, he's sweet, creative, a great writer, really good at Dungeon  Mastering and playing Smash. But we also just sorta fell into dating. He's  the second person I have ever considered  myself with, but I haven't told my friends that I have been dating (they act more like older siblings and would ring my neck if they knew.), so I have been pretty much dealing with relationship by myself for the first time. It felt nice, everyday is just great, we have so much fun, but the thing is I was his first girlfriend and he was also dating his boyfriend at the time. They broke up shortly after he went off to college but right after he met a girl..

I have  never really mind he was poly before, but that was because his other relationship was long distance and he didn't  often mention about it. Now, it's hard to get a real conversation with him, he talks about her so much more, no more pictures, no more real time to RP because he's  off kissing her.. like he didn't  even warn me. He just comes back and tells me everything about it. I cried so hard that night I just didn't know what to do. Now I'm just conflicted..he still loves me, at least he tells me that, but we haven't  had a realllll  discussion about it. Is it wrong that I am jealous that I can't  be there physically? That I can never have the same treatment?

t3_dk4vus,Stood Up,"Hey All,

So a little background: I got out of a long term 7 year relationship around 7 months ago. I‚Äôm 26, so I thought I was going to marry her but life had other plans. About a month after the breakup I told my self I had to do everything in my power to get my self-confidence again. So I started working out 6 days a week,meal prepping, and focusing on my career.  Well, fast forward 6-7 months later, I said what I was going to do,  I‚Äôve been very  consistent, and it just makes me  extremely happy with where my life is currently at and headed too in terms of mentally, physically, emotionally, and financially. 

So about a month ago, I had the realization I‚Äôm over my ex and would love to go on a date.  Sure enough I was walking through A common - visited grocery store, seen a worker I thought was cute and asked for her number.  She gave it to me, and we agreed to dinner and drinks. Well we had that date planned for yesterday, I was gonna take her to a really nice restaurant, that‚Äôs not to up tight, but more with a relaxed ambience.  She seemed excited as she said multiple times ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited, you‚Äôre really cute, I can‚Äôt wait for Friday‚Äù.  Soooo...I got excited I told her I would pick her up at a certain time, she agreed and that was that.

Fast forward to yesterday, I texted her late morning just confirming our reservation time, and asked her to send address.  I didn‚Äôt hear from her the rest of the day. 


So I was ghosted but I woke up today to her viewing my Snapchat story but with no explanation of why she ghosted me.  I went out with a buddy instead and he said these things happen all the time in this modern- dating world, and said it would probably happen again. I‚Äôm not mad, I mean her loss is how I think of it but at the same time, just wondering what happened?

The other problem is I go to that grocery store once a week and it‚Äôs next to my house, I don‚Äôt want to make it awkward but at the same time she could of just been honest, and I would of been cool with it

t3_dkc810,I [21/F] don't like his teeth [28/M],"I've been talking to this guy for a few months. We live across the world but he had plans to come down to my city to work and get a job so we further pursued it.

We met up a few days ago, and it was good. I noticed from the start he didn't have the best teeth, so i tried to brush it off...but now it's starting to bother me. It's one thing to have crooked teeth, and slightly yellow but he has a lot of plaque and he has black/mould growing on his teeth. His breath doesn't smell, but because of his bad teeth, the more I kiss him the more repulsed I get. He ticks everything but he's teeth. I don't mean to be shallow, I've been fine with guys with small teeth imperfections but once your teeth gets black - that's a serious sign of bad oral hygiene.

I am a bit stuck on what to do - it's been alright apart from the teeth issue and I don't know what to say to him. I guess because he won't be down here again until a good few months so I can decide whether to continue but in all honestly his teeth bothers me.",dating_advice
t3_dkc34x,Is she lying about being pregnant?,"I was in a relationship with this guy and we were planning to get married. This summer he had left me because he told me he was interested in another girl. Fast forward 3 months he contacts me again out of the blue and tells me how much he regretted what he did and how he wants to start over with me again. We all make mistakes that we regret and he seemed genuinely sorry, so I forgave him and got back together with him. A little while later after we got back together, this girl he previously left me for (they were never in an official relationship apparently and it was short-lived), her sister contacts my boyfriend saying that this girl is pregnant. However the sister has been very vague and not giving out any details, and same with the girl. The girl has also made claims to him that she is pregnant, but my boyfriend has not seen any proof of this. She lives in another town 2 hours away and has not even been to see him to discuss this. Furthermore, it is 2 months later and she still refuses to give any details at all as well as her sister. I've tried telling my boyfriend that I believe they are lying to him as they are refusing to give him any details about anything, but I am afraid he is falling for their lies and games as they string him along with no information or proof to back anything up. My boyfriend even mentioned to me that with the way her sister and her told it to him, he doesn't feel it should be trusted. But he continues to stress out as they are not giving him any information. She has not sent him any pictures of a positive pregnancy test, no information from a doctor's appointment, nothing at all. I've began to distance myself from the situation as this is not what I had signed up for when I had gotten back together with him. My intuition is telling me that this girl and her sister are lying to him. After 2 months of being pregnant, there would have been something to show for it. I would like to know other people's honest opinions on this situation and any advice would be appreciated.

Tl;dr Boyfriend left me for another girl (they were not officially dating, and it was short-lived), then we got back together a few months later, and shortly after we got back together this girl claims she is pregnant and her sister says this girl is pregnant too, yet they both haven't given any information or proof and are continuing to refuse to give any information regarding this pregnancy 2 months later.",dating_advice
t3_dk57c8,How do I open myself up to dating again after I have been cheated on in the past?,"I [M22] don't know if this is the right place to post something like this and I am sure someone has already asked it before, but honestly I mostly just want to vent a little bit and I don't really have anywhere else to talk to about this other than Reddit. 

Background: I was always a really shy kid, so when it came to dating I was a late bloomer when it came to getting my first real girlfriend. Long story short, I ended up being a rebound for her and she got back with her ex. No big deal there really. My next girlfriend (Let's call her Lisa), however, was the girl I wanted to marry. She was beautiful, kind, and loyal (or so I thought) and we had plans to tie the knot as soon as we both finished college and had the money to do so. Fast forward two years and we break up because Lisa wanted to fuck her manager at the Pizza Ranch more than she wanted to stay in the relationship with me. 

This left me heartbroken, without my best friend, and completely at a loss for what to do next. I gave absolutely 100% of my heart to Lisa in this relationship and her heart just wasn't in it as much as I thought it was. To be clear I've come to terms with her cheating on me and I realize there were things I could have done better in our relationship but, at the time, I was absolutely blindsided when a mutual friend told me she had been bragging about making out with this guy for months before I knew about it.

Fast forward to now, 3 years after we broke up, and I am still having issues with dating. I used to be flirty and (not to toot my own horn) pretty good at the initial courtship part of dating but now it's like I'm a shell of my former self. I've went on dates and even been in relationships with a few girls since then but they all have ended quickly because none of them were able to fill the hole that Lisa left. I want to get back on my feet and find someone that can make me happy again, but I just can't seem to find my footing. I stumble over words, I have a hard time coming up with date ideas, and I still just genuinely feel empty when it comes to women. 

Is this normal? And what can I do to, metaphorically, hit the reset button on my dating ability?

t3_dkbofm,I'm [23M] self sabotaging before anything has really happened,"During one of my classes on Friday we were put into groups during discussion to talk through some of the week's topics. A girl I'm interested in was in my group, and we had a really great conversation (among all of us). There were some funny moments talking over each other, and it seemed that we got along really well. At the end of class, she begins to compliment me, asking about my major and interests, saying it is a lot of fun talking to me (this is all happening during the 5 minutes before I needed to catch the bus).

This *really* caught me off guard. I hadn't talked with this girl ever before but was pleasantly surprised by what was going on. I'm a bit awkward, so after briefly explaining what I'm studying, I wasn't sure where to go next because I was short on time and my caveman brain led me to ask ""Did you have a specific question?"" quite condescendingly (or so I felt).

We ended the conversation nicely, saying we'd see each other later. I kind of feel like I should have suggested we meet and talk more or something. I can do this Monday, but during my late teenage years my head was filled with PUA shit about closing and all that. I don't really buy it, and given that she struck up another conversation after our discussion I'm probably alright.

SO I (24f) haven‚Äôt dated or done anything with a guy in a year (since my last kind of serious thing that lasted 6 months) so I downloaded a dating app a month ago to maybe test the waters again. A day or so in I matched with a guy, let‚Äôs call him Eric (26m). We hit it off right away and made plans to grab drinks after 2 days of texting on the app. 

Before the date I stalked his instagram (his first and last name were on his profile) and saw he had dozens of tagged photos with a girl who was obviously his girlfriend. But she hadn‚Äôt posted them in awhile so I assumed they broke up at least a month before he met me. 

Anyways, our first date went AMAZING and he asked to see me again as we parted ways.
Our second date was a week later and it went just as good he was really great and I was super happy I met someone so compatible with me so quickly into dating again.  I really got my hopes up (dumb)

After our third date is when he told me he‚Äôs in an open relationship (fuck no) and that his girlfriend of 7 years (he‚Äôs 26) came out as bi a year ago and a couple months ago she decides to go overseas and a month ago is when she wanted to open the relationship up and he was reluctant but didn‚Äôt want to stifle who she is.

I wasn‚Äôt keen on being in an open relationship so I kind of told him that. And he said he‚Äôs not comfortable with the open relationship thing either, he said he‚Äôs a monogamous man, and that he likes me a lot, I told him I liked him too and where we left it off was maybe we shouldn‚Äôt do this anymore if we‚Äôre both going to catch feelings.

I was sad but happy I made clear lines and was ready to move on, I even made the joke ‚Äúhe‚Äôs perfect...except the girlfriend part.‚Äù
But, he called me 2 days after our third date and told me him and his girlfriend broke up and he wants to see me. I. Was. THRILLED. 

We talked and he said he needs some space to mourn but he‚Äôs really excited to see me again and I told him I was fine with that.
We texted for around 2 weeks very flirty and friendly and he kept saying he was looking forward to seeing me again. I also noticed he deleted the dating app we met on.

But NOW out of nowhere he‚Äôs ghosted me :( 
He hasn‚Äôt texted me back in a week when we would text every day but he‚Äôs active on his social media (which I don‚Äôt follow him on)
I feel so upset I deleted his number and I‚Äôm trying to have more self respect so I‚Äôm trying to go by the ‚Äúif they wanted to, they would have‚Äù mantra. 

I constantly feel like I‚Äôm waiting for him to text me or call but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen. I honestly don‚Äôt think he and his girlfriend got back together since she broke up with him and she‚Äôs still overseas dating other men and women.

Any ideas what happened and how I can find closure within myself? I feel really bad and upset",dating_advice

t3_djjbu2,My last relationship has set the bar so high I now feel like I am unable to enjoy dates anymore,"Dating my last girlfriend has really set the bar incredibly high for new dates for me. 

She was super fun, open minded and, most importantly, incredibly curious. She put in alot of effort in getting to know me and right off the bat we were either meeting or calling eachother daily even before we were in any semblance of a relationship. 

It was electrifying from day one and she so far has been the only girl I have ever dated that I've kissed on my first date. For reference I was 24 years old back then and she was my second relationship, but definitiely not my second ever date.

Due to several reasons we mutually decided to break up in May of this year. 

I have started dating again in July, but with my newfound perspective, I have been unable to enjoy any new dates so far. None of them were as exciting as the ones with my ex and none of the girls seem to be as open-minded and curious as my ex. No kisses and no second dates so far.

For  context, late 20s guy here, and due to a myriad of roadblocks like  shyness, awkwardness, and just bad luck with women I really don't have  much experience with women. I had been working on myself a lot and just  kinda abandoned the idea of dating for a good while until recently. I  ended up going out with a girl recently and she asked me about my  previous relationships and i kinda lied to look normal. I mentioned  never having a relationship go beyond a month which is technically true but really  its zero outside of a few first dates that turned into a friendly not  interested from them. During my self imposed monk mode after a while I  just stopped caring. Its not that I cannot not talk to women its just  that for a good while I saw relationships as more trouble than they are  worth so I never made a lot of moves, the women in my life where in  relationships or not interested in me that way, which is fine it  happens.",dating_advice

t3_dk9o2g,I'm an introvert with a crush on an introvert who I think likes me but hasn't verbalized or made a move. I'm not sure what to do.,"TLDR at bottom

So, I was working with this guy for a year and a half and I thought he was interesting. After a year of working together, we started getting closer to each other and spending more time together. I noticed a shift. He was hanging around me much more often when he didn't used to. It got to a point whenever he had the opportunity to, he was near me. I took notice of this and him talking to me more often. Then I was working in a different department (pharmacy specifically) so I didn't see him as much. I noticed when I was working in that department, he would conveniently be working within view from the pharmacy counter or he'd come up to ask the pharmacist random things but when he did, he was looking at me (who was 4 ft away from the pharmacist). Please note, he hates the pharmacy and avoids being near it so I thought that was odd. Then one day, he didn't know I was working. We'd been there for hours and when I went to take my lunch break, I bumped into him and he said ""Oh, you're here?"" When I returned to pharmacy after, he started showing up nearby which he wasn't doing before he saw I was there. My male coworker who is close with him also kept asking me about him all of a sudden like if I thought he was handsome and stuff. It was out of the blue. Then when the three of us were on a shift together, my coworker waited until he saw me enter the same aisle as them, then asks this guy ""Have you ever felt something for another human being?"" and I thought it was just so weird cuz he saw me walking toward them and then he asks that as soon as I'm in earshot. I felt like my coworker was playing wingman for him. We gradually grew much closer, talking more and spending a lot of time together at work. He treated me differently from other female coworkers and my other make coworkers didn't treat me like he did. His treatment of me was also different from how he used to treat me before we started getting closer. He can be kinda shy around me and I'll see him struggle to find something to say to me but even when he doesn't say anything, he'll always just hang out with me while I work. No matter where we were in the store, we always made eye contact. Every time I saw him, he was looking at me. During meetings, he'd stand beside me. He'd make me laugh and do silly things because it would make me smile and whenever we left at the same time, he'd linger a little and walk out with me. He's the type of guy that is actions over words and we actually communicated a lot non-verbally because we became close enough I could understand what he was thinking just by the look on his face. His body language and actions all tell me he has a crush on me. He has trouble expressing himself, especially his feelings. He started to get a little comfortable with me because he confided in me something work related that was really bothering him. Then, all of a sudden, he quit. I had a gut feeling earlier that week he might do something like that. Something just didn't feel right and this was shortly after confiding in me about things bothering him at work. The last day I worked with him after he announced he quit, I chose to tell him how I felt before he left. I told him he's the only person I can count on, I look forward to always seeing him, I enjoy talking to him and I've come to have a crush on him. I told him I'd really miss him but I was happy for him. He put his hand on my lower back and said ""I appreciate that."" Like I said, this guy has trouble expressing himself but he never touched me before so I was shocked he decided to place his hand on my lower back right after I said I like him. So I felt bold because of it and asked for a hug. Without hesitation, he said sure. Now I've seen him hug another girl before and it was very quickly, barely even touched her shoulders and he was leaning in from a good foot away to hug her. That was not how he hugged me. My face was buried in his chest and he held me close and for a long time. He did not let go of me until I pulled away from him. Since he quit, I haven't seen him much. Mostly due to medical reasons on his part so I've only really been texting him. Whenever we text, he never initiates the text convo, but he'll reply very quickly after I text him. It's been about a month and like I said, there were some medical issues on his part but since telling him I like him, I feel like nothing's really happened. I'm sure he has feelings for me but he hasn't verbalized it or tried to make a move at all. So I don't know what to do. I'm getting anxiety about texting him because I'm afraid I'm just gonna end up bothering him.

TLDR;
Introvert guy shows obvious interest in me through body language and actions in person but hasn't verbalized it, hasn't made a move at all and doesn't text me first. He doesn't do this with others. What do I do?",dating_advice
t3_dk9mwk,How to Stop Being Shy,"Shyness can be a problem for many. The fear and insecurity of social relations is real and it's something that I used to have in my life. Not anymore! In this [video](https://youtu.be/4udzZQHCuSY) I tell the things I did to conquer my shyness once and for all.

When young I was an open kid, running and chatting all day long. But something happened in my life that changed those qualities. Instead of open I was now close, having problems to socialize with other people. The moment I realized I had this though, I decided to tackle it and make a change.

It wasn't easy in the beginning. The amount of resources available were few, adding the fact that it wasn't something people would openly talk about. I struggled specially on school, when I had to speak publicly. A point to mention though is that this is not something exclusive for shy people. Lots of people struggle to speak for a crowd. The most common cause is probably the fear of being rejected, that what you say will not please those listening. That you will make some terrible mistake and people will notice and even laugh at you. 

My first big step to stop being shy happened with a candy, and a desire to make things differently. Test of will is the name I called it. And I would apply it wherever I could, in hopes to trigger inside me something that would set me free of my shyness. Those were essencial to me, building the foundations to my next and final step on this matter.

By the time I was doing Law school I realized I had to put and end to my shyness, and so I came to this idea of acting classes. A solution quite drastic, but nevertheless necessary. It was hard, but I was tired of trying other things without the success rate I would like.

My suggestion if you're shy and it bothers you is to start one step at a time. Building your confidence slowly but constantly. It's a though fight, but well worthy of the results if you have the perseverance to go for it.",dating_advice

t3_dk3o87,Dated for only two weeks and now it seems and I'm so sad and confused. Advice please,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sad and need your advice. Basically I (31F) moved to a new city and in my very first week I met this guy (35M) at work which was only two and a half weeks ago. Hit it off right away, and we started hanging out almost every day, even though I was honestly not sure about his intentions with me. He kinda has a reputation as a womanizer, and I could see why. In the office I would always see him talking and flirting with girls and he wasn't shy at all to approach me. Also, I found him immature at times- Like he mentioned several times that he only flirted with girls in the beginning because he wanted me to be a little jealous. I did get the feeling though that he actually likes me. He took me out on dates, we spent so much time together, he was sweet to me when we were alone, also slept together, of course. Again, we met only two and a half weeks ago, so you see that things were moving fast. I started liking him more, I enjoyed my time with him, but I was also a little worried that in the end he'd just be playing with me and I would get hurt in the end (been there before and that wasn't nice).In these two and a half weeks we have not once spoken about being exclusive or about a future together. He also hasn't said he has feelings for me or anything like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past Thursday we had a work party with the entire office, a really casual thing with open bar. We were sitting next to each other, but we wouldn't touch, hold hands, kiss or anything. For me that was very okay, because it's only been two weeks since I know him and have been seeing him, and I was definitely not ready anyways to go public with him (especially since we haven't even talked about being exclusive), and I was sure he feels the same. Then at some point this other guy from our work shows up, let's call him B and the guy I was seeing A. A cannot stand B for the sole reason that he knows that B has a thing for me, and that he always flirts with me. So B sits down next to me, A is on my other side. I hasn't seen B in days, so we started talking. Literally as soon as B sat down next to me, A started acting all territorial. He kept pulling me towards him, putting his hand on my legs in a very obvious way etc . etc. I did not like that at all, because I know he just did that to make it clear to the other guy that I'm 'his', and not because he always does that. When B got up for a few minutes to get another drink, A even pushed his chair away and said he hopes that B gets lost. Even a girl from my work that I don't really know came up to me and whispered in my ear asking if everything is okay because A seems to be acting extremely jealous. I told him in a nice way to stop this and be nice to B. B came back and we kept talking, while A kept touching my legs, pulling me towards him etc, and I kept pushing him away until I got really mad, so I literally told him to stop fucking touching me and that I know he only does it so B knows I'm 'his'. A got mad, didn't admit to anything and then just got up, told me he's going home and left. I didn't follow him, I was so mad. Kept talking to B all night, nothing happened though. 

The next morning (yesterday) I didn't see A in the office, so I messaged him and asked if everything is ok. He messaged me back saying that he felt humiliated and really hurt by my behaviour, that he thought this was going somewhere and that he can't believe that I told him to stop touching me, while I was 'flirting' with the other guy all night long. That he would never do that to me. That he doesn't understand why I would try to hide from B that him and I are seeing each other. I was like what?? We haven't even talked about being exclusive and we literally just met two weeks earlier, that I do like him and everything, but that I'm also very mad at him because of his behaviour. I told him to meet me after work so we can talk about this, and he said there is nothing to talk about and that he just wants to move on from 'this' and find someone who wants the same as him. I was like wtf? He then stopped responding. This morning he sent me a short text just saying 'I'm sorry for how I behaved on Thursday.' I answered, he read it and never answered again. A coworker I'm close with told me he met some random chick at a bar last night, so I guess he got laid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I feel so hurt, and mistreated, but also bad for hurting him. I wonder if I actually hurt him and his feelings though, or just his ego/pride. If he really cared about me, wouldn't he have wanted to meet me and talk about things, instead of getting with some random chick one day later? Isn't the whole jealousy thing a red flag anyways, especially so early on and especially since we haven't even talked about being more serious or anything? Or was it really disrespectful what I did, by talking all night to the other guy and telling A to stop touching me (I would have talked a lot more to A that night, but his jealous behaviour really pissed me off so I rather talked to the other guy). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, I'm sad and confused. So now it's over between us it seems, even though it hadn't even really started.He doesn't even seem interested in one last talk to clear up things. And as stupid as it sounds, I do miss him a lot. What do you think about all this? Do you think it's for the best that he's out of my life? Could I have done something different? Or what would you do in my situation now?

She started out saying she was kind of seeing a guy. As the week went on that turned into boyfriend. At the end of the week she was kind of concerned about the relationship as the guy is (22) 6 years younger than her. I'm (32) 4 years older than her. I think this is a rebound as she did come out of another relationship a little while ago. I won't be working with her next week and I am not sure when I'll see her again.

t3_dk8xw7,"Messed up first kiss, deal breaker or fixable?","So I (23M) went on a date yesterday with a girl (22F) yesterday night which was one of the best of my life until the very end.  We had a lot in common (same interests, grew up in the same town, etc.) the conversation flowed naturally and the date went hours longer than expected. It took place at a Mexican restaurant too where the wait staff was super nice and gave us a bunch of stuff for free as we were some of the last people there.

Close to midnight I walked her back to her car and went in for a first kiss but since she is almost a foot shorter than I am (F: 5‚Äô2) (M:6‚Äô1)  and we were in a cramped space I couldn‚Äôt lean in properly and gave her a kiss on her cheek instead.  Felt awkward
 after that and said something to the effect of ‚ÄúSorry, have a goodnight.‚Äù  And felt like a total moron after.

Just texted her and still waiting on a reply.  Prior to that awkward moment she had indicated she wanted to do something else when I asked for a follow up and said she had a great time.

So my question is, is this situation un-salvageable?  Have any of you gone on a good second date with a girl after an awkward / botched first kiss?

TLDR:  Went on a great date with a girl last night but botched the first kiss at the end, is there a way to come back from that?",dating_advice
t3_dk8uxa,I [27m] struggle to turn relationships/friendships/dates into a romantic relationship.,"Hi all!

English ist not my first language, so some parts might sound weird.

tldr: I am 27 years old and struggle to turn a ""relationship/friendship"" into a romantic one. Because I am too shy?

I am an physician, but would not call myself a total nerd: I like to dress well (at least most of the time, haha), do sports and enjoy going out with friends. I consider myself quite lucky as things are going really well in general (social life is ok, just moved to a new flat, doing a lot of sport, my business is going well,...).

Now when it comes to dating, things are much harder for me. Tinder is going ""meh"" (got my profile checked by a friend, she found it alright) and getting to know new girls is quite rare. I once had a serious relationship once which did not last long. Since then, I am essentially looking for a girlfriend again.

Of course, I had a few dates in the meantime. We always bond really well and had a great time, with me falling in love a few times. The problem is that in my head I know that I have to make things a little more romantic and make the next move to ask her out to turn this into a serious relationship. But somehow, this feels kind of wrong and I am afraight I might be too ""pushy"" and the girl wont like it.

Turns out I am wrong and after a few dates the girls wonder what they are up to and what my intentions are.

Any tips on how to improve this? Thanks!",dating_advice

t3_dk5bc1,29 [F] dating (?)/seeing (?) 26 [M] unsure of when the right time would be to divulge more private/accurate details of past marriage/child.,"We matched on an app three months ago and have been regularly seeing each other for about 10 weeks. Dinners, gigs, lunches, movies, drinks. I like him a lot, and we have a great time together as we bond over music (we're both fans of heavier music). He's respectful, kind and lovely to be around.

I got divorced a year ago and I have a 5 year old child who lives with his dad. They live nearby and I spend time with him roughly 10 days a month. I have an excellent relationship with my ex and it's all good. 

I have never openly mentioned my son with 26 [M] for the fear of having to talk about my divorce and everything else, because every time I spend time with this guy it's been nothing but great, I feel like talking about such heavy topic would bring the whole mood down. I also don't want to ""open up"" for fear that he might not even care as he doesn't want a relationship with me so it won't matter to him (he's due to leave the country in a year, he's just temporarily in the country for his work).

We're making plans for travelling next year so I see us getting closer, yes, but having an expiry date is making me a little wary about how deep I should be getting into this.

How do I approach having to be more honest about my life but also be on guard in the event that he may not even want a relationship? 

As for me, I am really into him and I would like to be exclusive, no doubt.

For guys- it‚Äôs a numbers game. A woman will match with you and even if she talks with u she might get  bored of the convo or there might be a better guy in her match queue and move on.

t3_dk7ov4,"Islamic country, guy invites me to his place.","So I met this guy at college about 3 weeks ago. We had conversations, we studied together, he invited me for coffee and dinners and walks at night around the neighborhood. He insisted on paying my tabs, he ran when I told him I was waiting for him at the library, he carried my laptop and walked me home, he complimented me and made future plans to go on one day trips outside the city just the two of us. Sounds like flirting, right?

 Now keep this in mind, we live in an islamic country with horrible amounts of sexism and objectifying women. So when I couldn't control my huge mouth and blurted out I never planned to get married and have kids, I guess this must have given him the wrong idea about me. Because it took him only one day after he heard about this that he called me to his house to study, mentioning his housemate was out of town. I nicely refused. He told me I misunderstood. I told him even if he didn't think of anything other than studying, it was still bad, for being together in his place for hours would definitely get me a horrible reputation and lead to having me shamed by girls, targeted by boys. I told him that I felt sad to see he didn't think how that would affect me. But I doubt he even listened to what I said, because he started explaning how he never tought of me as anything more than a friend and I was misunderstanding his intention. I told him that this made me even more heartbroken, for he tought I would do all that stuff like walks at night and dinners together and even go stay at his place when we are nothing more than friends. I explained to him how his actions were very easy to misunderstand, that is, unless if this wasn't his intention from the very beginning. 

 Then as I expected an explanation of some sort, he suddenly started complaining about how girls misundetstand him all the time. He even sent me screenshots of his conversation with another girl. In these conversations he was flirting with the girl using th exact same sentences as he did with me. He then proceeded to ask her whether she had feelings for him. She said yes, he said altough he previously tought she was super hot, he didn't think of her as more than friends and would like to continue like this. Sending these screenshots truly felt out of context and I felt something was off, which I still can't put my finger on.

 I told him I would help him with the school projects like I promised, but I didn't want to be friends with him. I kindly asked him not to mention to people that he even invited me home for I know from experience that people talk. (I even refused him walking me all the way to my apartment before, explaining him how I did not want people getting the wrong toughts about me as they see a guy with me late at night. I tought I made it clear that this made me uncomfortable.) Which made him angry at first, insistent later. When he called me twice despite me mentioning I did not want to talk to him, I ended up saying he was making me uncomfortable. Reading this, he immediately blocked me from all kinds of communication ways and social media.

 Now I don't want to be friends with him and am grateful that he blocked me, because I would have honestly fallen in love with him and he clearly didn't want anything in that context with me. But I am not sure if I was right to act the way I acted, or if I overreacted. Could you please give me insight on the matter and tell me how I could have handled things differently maybe? And pleae keep in mind that I live in an islamic country.",dating_advice

I feel no love and also have no love left for her.  I should leave- i tell myself that often. Sadly it's much easier said than done for me.  My kids would feel awful and that would make me feel like the bad guy. We've tried marriage counseling twice but never lasts long since the counselors hone in on her selfish behaviour and she can't stand to go back and hear it again. I'm lost on what I should do. Her numerous affairs and escapades would be enough to drive most away quickly i think. I just cant get away from it. Why is it so difficult?  Anyone else fight this inner battle?  Am I coward for staying?  Am I too weak to start fresh? But fresh isnt fresh because I dont want my kids to distance themselves from me over this. They see her negativity and I try to convince myself theyll understand but its driving mad because although I try my convincing doesnt work on me. We both make 6 figures  financially I know we would both be fine. I dont care about the money either I'd be willing to move to a small place and keep my kids on the beautiful home weve built.

t3_djn4rb,Dating is not fun,"I don't want to see guys only talking about how depressing dating is so here take my experiences: 

I'm 26f, there are good and bad days but overall I'm fit and comfortable in my body, I work a steady job, I'm not (totally) stupid and I'm able to listen and hold a conversation, even contribute something with hobbies of mine.

Yeah well, turns out it's not enough. I wasn't actively looking for someone, been single for 2 years, but decided to give dating a try.
Mind you, I truly have no type, I only expect some level of hygiene and grooming, otherwise I say let's meet and then decide if we feel it or not.

I don't understand how someone can say dating for women is easy.

I got stood up completely, dates got cancelled, guys vanished without a trace, I had to listen to stories of ex-girlfriends, how much they make in a month and how cool a threesome with total strangers would be - mind you, first dates.

I expect someone who sticks to a date if agreed, one who, if he's busy, makes some time because he's interested - if not not he's able to 
a) say he really is busy and offers an alternative in return, ready to compromise
b) say he simply is not interested (enough to make time)

Someone who knows what personal hygiene is, who can read basic social cues and isn't afraid to express what they truly think or feel, one who doesn't need to play games (Hot Tip: 'ignoring her for three days will make her go crazy about you' yesss..)

I'd call myself a very calm person, got told I'm a good listener and enjoyable to be around, I know I make mistakes, plenty of them, but I do my best and sometimes just say if I want to see someone again or if I enjoyed the date.

I've tried a couple times but they ALL rejected me.

I feel uncomfortable and conflicted.  Hell, I feel uncomfortable that I feel uncomfortable.  I don't want to feel averse.  I've never considered this before, but I feel if the connection is good that I should be open minded.  I don't like that I feel uncomfortable about it and if I can feel like I did before she told me I'd want to be able to do that.  First date after she told me felt awkward to me at first, but I noticed from the start that she was still the same cute girl to me most of the time.

I also feel terrible that she has to go through this crap over and over.  She told me that men almost always leave when she tells them, and while I get the discomfort (since I feel it too) I think that's a terrible thing she has to deal with that is really unfair. anyone on here gone through this?

t3_dlp453,high school crush matched with me on a dating app almost ten years later,"ya'll. i am about to lose my mind right now, because what is going on is simply so absurd but so ravishing for me at the same time. when i was in high school, i was the quirky, awkward acne+braces kid trying to find her voice and self at the same time so my dating ops were slim to none till the very last year of my senior year. anyways, there was this guy...this guy who would say the most incredible, thoughtful, most profound things out of nowhere from the course of having classes with him on and off from 8th grade to senior year, and in short...i just knew that as we progressed in age and maturity between the walls of the high school experience.. he was not like the others. we had brief conversations through my time of middle school and high school where he would sometimes initiate them, but i was too shy and too self critical of myself to try to actually pursue anything or even think i could have anything romantically with him because he was also stunning on the eyes and i was...not...to put it simply. put together the image of the socially awkward, unattractive female scrambling through the halls trying to not be seen or make eye contact and you have me in a nutshell during those years...

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward and not a lot has changed in the feeling awkward all the time department, but i am decently attractive now and able to actually talk to dudes for 5 hours or 8 even sometimes on the first date and just in general. so, i'm perusing through the dating apps that i'm  on+sites because i'm single obvs and i actually pay for some  of them every now and then to just like short line the mindless swiping...and i see my old high school crush...liking me...ME...on one of the apps. i blink as slow as i possibly can to process this optical illusion, but his face is still there. his name. all the signs that this is the same man i fell for years ago from afar...and everything that could possibly allow me to crave a human as much as i did this man comes rushing in with the most intense waves of emotions i've felt in weeks....years even. i've been in love before and had bursts of good relationship moments that overwhelmed me, but to this day no one has caused as huge of an internal uproar as seeing this man or being around him.i don't want to screw this up by saying something abnormal or off the wall, so reddit...ya'll...if you have any suggestions on what to say first...please HALP a girl out. i know he knows it's me, but i'm just not sure how to broach this feeling of shock and anxiety to even begin to craft a proper response.",dating_advice

t3_dlo1br,I [18M] can't get over my crush on my best friend [19F] of several years and after things got a bit more serious I don't know how to handle it without potentially ruining our friendship,"*Obligatory throwaway because she knows my main account.*

Sorry for the long post but I'm sure I'm not the only one who is (or was) in this specific situation (you'll see in a moment) but I couldn't find any other post matching my case so here it goes:

So I [18M] met my best friend [19F] a couple of years ago. We started talking daily and soon realized we have the same topics of interest and we get along very good. About a year of texting daily and meeting several times a month I realized I had a crush on her. About this time we started talking about our dating life and what we look for in a boyfriend/girlfriend but her standards were unrealisticly high (imho) and although I felt like she was a perfect match for me, I realized I just don't stand a chance and decided to try and get over it in shstead of confessing and potentially ruining our friendship or eating myself from the inside.

Another year passes and our friendship is only getting stronger. We sleep-over at each other's place every so often and we talk about things I didn't think I'd share with anyone. We take each other to dinner every now and then just for fun and our friendship is better-then-ever every day. I also got over the crush I had on her and feel that I'm finally ready to date other women which I did in the last 6 month but nothing came out of it.
I also know she was dating other guys at that period of time (and before it tbh) and we both share with each other that we are actively looking for a romantic relationship.

This brings us to this month. This month she slept over at my place for at least once a week (once even for 3 days) since we hangout a lot and she lives in another city which is like a 2 hours train ride away. We recently talked about again about the things we look to have in a future bf/gf and suddenly (although to be fair, we hadn't talked about it for about a year) her standards were WAY LOWER. She said most of the things she said she were looking for the last time we talked doesn't really matter to her anymore and she is basically looking for a decent human being who wouldn't want to have sex with her after 2 dates. Very cool, can do, but this is not what made me crush on her again.

The weeks after, every time we met she got more and more touchy (like, physically). She touched me a lot when talking to me and I obviously returned her in the same manner. We watched a movie at my place and she lets me lay my head on her shoulder (keep in mind that usually we barely have physical contact except for hugging when meeting or saying goodbye) etc..

The thing that made me crush on her HARD again was when we met yesterday. She was touchy (again, physically) as the new usually which I'm totally cool with and is returning her with that same touchy-ness and she suggested we watch a movie together. Cool! She picks a comedy movie and we had a blast watching it on her bed and when not bursting in laugh, we laid each other's head on each other (if it makes sense) and she puts her hand on mine but in a kinda casual manner.. After the movie ends we stayed there laying down on her bad and continue to talk about some stuff. The whole time she keeps rubbing my shoulder/arm occasionally when she talked and I did the same in return.. We end up talking about some situation that was very difficult for her to go to through and while I was trying to make her feel better, we end up kinda cuddling/hugging. At the end I gave her a huge hug (best hug I've ever had) and we stayed like this for about 10 minutes.


At this point you may be thinking that I should totally go for it but consider the following:
1. The past weeks we were talking about very personal topics so her behavior might be explained by her being extra vulnerable and needing to feel safe.

2. Since we use to take each other to dinner, I cant really ask her for a date to see how she reacts. It'd just be another night of us hanging out...

3. I really *really* cannot afford to lose her. She is my best friend and I would be devastated if I was to lose her. I don't want to do anything that will ruin our friendship. On one hand, I'm afraid it's just some temporary need of attention and I don't want to scare her off. On the other hand, I don't want to miss that train either.


I've never had a gf before (and she never had a bf) and I'm very bad at picking up hints. My social anxiety doesn't help either... I just can't stop thinking about it.
Sorry for the long reading, will appreciate any advice - especially wether or not I should confess to her about my feelings and HOW should I do it (like, what is the best way not to scare her off etc)

t3_dlspab,How do I stop falling for distant people?,"I have noticed a pattern in my relationships where I‚Äôll fall really hard for people who ultimately end up becoming more and more distant.

Usually, they‚Äôll reciprocate interest for 3-4 months, and then slowly stop initiating and responding to my texts, sometimes ghosting me completely. Since my romantic feelings are all or nothing, this devastates me every time, and I end up being heartbroken for far longer than the relationship actually lasted. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy for a number of years, but can‚Äôt figure out the pattern. Since this has happened so many times, I can‚Äôt help but be anxious every time a new relationship begins because it feels so fragile.      It feels like most people are able to find long term partners fairly easily, and I can‚Äôt help but feel this is a reflection of my attachment style or the traits I‚Äôm attracted to in partners. 

Does anyone have advice or similar experiences to share?

Edit: I also wanted to add that I‚Äôm not a serial dater. It takes me a long time to find people I like, so I‚Äôve spent most of my life single. I probably develop crushes only once every couple years, and most of the time those don‚Äôt lead anywhere.",dating_advice
t3_dl24i2,The practical guide to bailing out on a first date,"I'm sure we've all had this happen to us at some point, and sometimes we have to do it too.

**Case1**, my friend Bob: How Not To Bail:

Bob met someone at a wedding, had a great chat, exchanged numbers, asked her out for a drink a few days later, she agreed, they settle on a time and place. He messages again the day before to confirm they are still on. She never replies.  Made him feel like shit.

**Case2**, a less bad but still bad case of How Not To Bail:

This happened to me last weekend. Matched on bumble, had a good chat, agree to meet up in the evening (at a location she suggested) in a couple of days. The day comes, I message in the morning to confirm we are still on. Nothing for the next 6h, although she's read it. 1h before I would be leaving the house, she calls me and says she's really sorry but she's actually got to go to a thing. I say no worries (although I am irritated by this), let me know if you want to re-arrange. She never messages me again, but I give her props for calling and at least sounding apologetic. She acknowledged it was a shitty thing to do. So some credit due, but it still sucked because with more notice I could have done something else with my time, and I'm pretty sure she knew from much earlier she'd have to bail.

Sometimes, you've got to bail. For whatever reason. Here is my guide on a) how to bail on someone in the least hurtful way possible and b) how to be bailed on.

**Arranging to meet:**

1. Only agree to meet in good faith. If you actually do not want to meet, DO NOT AGREE TO MEET. Be an adult and turn them down to begin with if you don‚Äôt want to meet. It's less hurtful than ghosting them.
2. Don‚Äôt make arrangements to meet if you aren‚Äôt certain you can make them. Just pick a different time.

**If you really have to genuinely bail:**

1. Actually communicate with your date. It takes 30s. Ghosting after agreeing to meet is shockingly disrespectful and always makes the recipient feel like shit as they slowly realise what you‚Äôre doing. Be an adult about it.
2. Calling rather than texting makes you seem more genuine and will help an apology go over better. But either will do.
3. If you don't want to come across as a douche it had better be a good reason. The shorter the notice the better the reason needs to be. If the reason is that you‚Äôve found a better prospect and would rather date them, make up a good reason to bail, bail well in advance, and then don‚Äôt re-arrange. I still think this is pretty shitty, to be avoided if possible, and it‚Äôs still not awesome for the recipient, but at least you didn‚Äôt ghost them. Tell them actually you've been really busy lately and need to take a step back whilst your life calms down.
4. Give as much notice as possible. Before the day is best, morning of the day is OK, last minute is never OK unless it‚Äôs an emergency. I would define last minute as too late for them to have a realistic chance of arranging to do something else with their time.
5. Be very apologetic. You just wasted this person‚Äôs time and depending on how much notice you gave them you stopped them from doing anything else either.
6. If you actually do want to meet, re-arrange a time then and there, don‚Äôt wait.
7. Accept that you probably won‚Äôt meet, because you‚Äôve flaked, you‚Äôve annoyed them, and they are probably now looking for other more reliable prospects.

**If you are being bailed on but still want to meet in future:**

1. Accept you are probably never going to meet. In my experience if someone bails on the first date you‚Äôve arranged, there‚Äôs about a 90% chance you‚Äôll never meet. I suspect most of the time the ‚Äúreason‚Äù is just an excuse because they don‚Äôt want to meet you any more and don‚Äôt want to tell you the real reason why. I suspect the real reasons are usually ‚ÄúI never actually wanted to meet in the first place‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found a better person to date‚Äù. Both are shitty to hear so I don't fault the use of a lie.
2. Be cool. It‚Äôs OK to be annoyed but if you want to give this person another chance you cannot show much irritation because who wants to meet someone that‚Äôs really annoyed with them? Sometimes these things are unavoidable.
3. Don‚Äôt bend over backwards to accommodate them. If they really want to meet they‚Äôll arrange to make it happen, it‚Äôs on them to fix.
4. They won‚Äôt arrange to make it happen. In my experience 90% of people that bailed on the first date never bothered to re-arrange. I guess they found better prospects.
5. Start looking for new prospects.

Basically, the take home from this is: be an adult and treat people with respect. Try to put a value on the time they allocated you and be mindful what you are doing by bailing. And if one of you bails on the first date it'll probably never happen.",dating_advice
t3_dljgsf,For the first time ever I managed to get a couple of numbers!,"I did it!

Having been previously a bit unkeen on re-joining tinder (as when i initially used it two years ago I barely got any matches and confidence-wise I was a wreck) I decided to reinstall it yesterday just for curiosity's sake. 

In the space between my first time using it and now, I went through growth, personality and physically and I feel like this helped me for good in life; [I took the gym seriously](https://imgur.com/a/fTIPmfp), groomed myself weekly and even grew a beard! Even joined a retail chain and worked with all kinds of customers, over there you really learn to have patience and empathy takes you a long way. When you make those kind of changes, its kind of hard not to take a liking to yourself, especially once progress starts coming in!

With that said, I was surprised at the amount of matches that I was getting today! I don't feel like tooting my own horn or anything but I feel as if  I have those last two years to thank, so much so that I though 'fuck it!' and asked for their numbers so I can better get to know them.

t3_dlo8vj,Is it possible to be interested in someone but rarely text them?,"I'm gonna try to keep this short but basically, I \[20F\] have been talking to this guy \[21M\] for about 3 months now (2 of those months we weren't in the same city because of summer break, but for this past month we've have been going on dates about 2-3x a week). We've been having sex almost every time we've seen each other, and he makes it a point to take me on actual dates, even though I'd be fine just going over and watching a movie and cuddling, which makes it seem like he wants something more than just a casual fwb.

&amp;#x200B;

He always pays for everything, is always the one to set up dates, has introduced me to his friends, and has told me that he wants a relationship out of this. Literally the only problem with him is that he never texts me. Most days we probably text for like 20 minutes, but I initiate it 8/10 times. I have never brought this up to him as being an issue because I feel like it's just his personality. Also, whenever I do text him, he usually responds within a few minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't really ever interact with people over the phone during the day (he isnt really active on social media or anything either) and he grew up in a different country than me so it could be a cultural difference? I've also never seen him on his phone when he's with me so maybe he just isn't a big phone guy.

I just want to know if anybody else is like this. You really like a person and could see yourself dating them, but don't feel the need to text them. I'm also probably being overanxious and dramatic, but I really like this guy and don't want to talk myself out of anything just because he doesn't text me nonstop, like most guys do when they're interested in me.

I'm a fairly sociable dude I have good banter with most people, even some people on her team. I talk to this guy that sits near her but I get this really odd vibe from her. Like even if we are crossing paths I feel like she makes an effort to not look at me. Sometimes when I'm talking to her coworker at his desk, other people around her will sometimes join in or talk but she would always maintain looking away. When we cross paths or ever are in each other's way she will look away always, and kinda hurry away. If we ever do make eye contact she will look away almost immediately. So I'm finding it difficult to even say Hi in a casual situation.

t3_dlqfxw,Am I in the wrong here?,"Hello! I really need advice about this situation.

I 20F starter dating 26M 2-3 months back, pretty much everything had been going great and smoothly. He asked me to be exclusive about two weeks ago and I ofcourse said yes as I had been planning to bring it up as well. I‚Äôve met his friends, family and everything. We had planned holidays and such so it was pretty serious. 

Anyway, last weekend (Friday) I was hanging out my friend. My friend had her tinder open and she saw that my guy had updated his tinder bio. I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know how to react. She texted him asking him about it since they‚Äôre friends as well and he said that it was ‚Äújust fun‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt respond and he called her repeatedly but I asked her not to pick up because I didn‚Äôt know what to say. 
The next day(Saturday), only once he found out she‚Äôd told me about his tinder, he texted me saying he ‚Äúonly updated the profile because it was fun but didn‚Äôt want to date anyone other than me, you never find anyone on tinder anyway‚Äù and he asked if we were okay. I told him we weren‚Äôt okay and that my grandma was visiting me so I couldn‚Äôt talk at the moment. (Which was true) 
He didn‚Äôt respond to that and completely went off the grid. 
Then, on Sunday I tried to call him and he didn‚Äôt pick up, so I texted him saying I was ready to talk about it asking him to call me. 
On Monday he texted me back saying that he‚Äôd already explained himself, didn‚Äôt know what else to say and that he thought I knew him better than to jump to conclusions about why he‚Äôd updated his tinder. This pissed me off so I tried to call him again, he didn‚Äôt pick up, so I texted asking if he didn‚Äôt have the guts to talk to me. 
This did the trick, he went on a rant saying he just didn‚Äôt want to talk to me, that he‚Äôd wanted to talk to me on Saturday but that I didn‚Äôt respond (??) That he didn‚Äôt get mad when I get messages from other guys and brought up this time when another dude drove me home after a night out (nothing happened there) because he trusted me but I couldn‚Äôt trust him now that he updated his tinder. I tried to tell him my side of everything while listening to his side. We proceeded to text about it for a bit but then he said he was going to face dinner with his family. 
Apparently he‚Äôs been having dinner with his family for over 24 hours because I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. 

I sent him a text saying I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions but it‚Äôs hard not to take his silence as him not wanting to give us a try and that he didn‚Äôt think I was worth it. He hasn‚Äôt responded and it‚Äôs been 4 hours.

t3_dlt2k1,I [24/M] think I am still in love with a girl [22/F] I dated for 2 months who moved back to Germany. Need advice.,"Apologies for the length of this post, I just really need to get this off my chest. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to hear me out.

I have always struggled with social anxiety, and have never had a meaningful long term relationship in my life. So, earlier this year, I did what most single guys who don't go out much do and made a Tinder account. I met a girl on there and we really hit it off over texts, so we set up a date at a local bar.

She was absolutely stunning. Smart, beautiful, funny, interesting, and everything else you could ever dream for in a girl. We talked and drank until midnight and we were too tired to continue. We didn't wait long to see each other again, and again we talked and drank all night. We kissed, and from that point she had stolen my heart. I think it was the first time I have ever truly been in love.

However, there is a catch: She is German. She was only here to complete an internship that was necessary for her to apply to PhD programs here in the States (she already has a master's degree at the age of 22. That's how smart and amazing she is). 

She left for Germany 2 months later with the status of if she would ever come back to my area of the States up in the air. We agreed to stay in touch, but we didn't really address the status of our relationship (we never really explicitly said that we were dating, I think because we both knew it would have to end soon). 

Messages got more and more far apart and now it's been 3 months since we've spoken. I don't know about her, but the reason I stopped messaging her regularly is for two reasons:

1. I wanted to move on. The distance just seems too far for us to work out. Even if she returns to the states to complete her PhD, it's unlikely to be anywhere near me.

2. I don't know if I was as special to her as she was to me. Frankly, I highly doubt it. While I have never been in a long term relationship, she had been in one that lasted 8 years (Yes, 8. That's not a typo). The guy had purposed to her and she rejected it because she felt she was too young and had no idea where her life would take her, which led to them breaking up. A 2 month fling with some American boy must be totally forgettable by her standards, right?

Every date I've been on since then just hasn't been the same. Nobody is as smart, as beautiful, or as funny as her. I can't get her out of my head. It's like I am not even looking for another girl, I'm just looking for the next ""her"". 

However, because I have never been in love before, I am really concerned that I'm just working myself up and making what we had out to be more than it was since I have nothing to compare it to. Maybe what we had was mediocre at best, but I just have nothing to compare it to?

I don't know what to do. It's unlikely she feels the same way about me and even if she did we are practically on opposite sides of the planet; should I just forget about her? We haven't spoken in 3 months; would it be too weird to suddenly tell her how I feel? I didn't even do that properly while she was here.

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I just feel lost.",dating_advice

we both follow each other on instagram and like pictures of each other and i feel like i should make a move by hitting her up or something before i enlist to the army in 2 months and probably lose the chance for ever.

what i wanted to ask is how hard is it to maintain a relationship and knowing you are far from you partner

t3_dlt1uq,Really don‚Äôt know how to proceed with this.,"A few weeks ago, I made it a goal of mine to finally start talking to this girl in my class that I was attracted to since the first day of class. I never talked to her until a few weeks ago because I thought I would have no chance until I decided to take a leap of faith. 

I first introduced myself at a campus store and we talked for a bit. Last week I felt like I made progress because after class I walked with her and we had a good 10 minute conversation about simple things like what we like and how our class is. I told her that she was very nice to talk to since I haven‚Äôt made any new friends and she told me that I am very nice as well. 

I talked to her a little bit in class today of how her weekend is and she asked how mine is. Only thing was that she was on her laptop and I sat next to her but she wasn‚Äôt talking to me until I initiated a conversation so I kind of feel like she may not be interested in me in that specific way. 

It‚Äôs just that I want to get to know her better since i don‚Äôt really get the chance to talk to her in class.

So after swearing I would never use tinder again (lol) I drunkenly redownloaded it recently and I started talking to someone. We‚Äôve been in contact for about two weeks and last week we decided to move off the app.

We talked for a few days and it was pretty awesome, we got along really well and had a lot in common. He seemed like he really liked me so far and the other night (Friday) when we were texting he suggested going out the following weekend. I agreed. The following night we FaceTimed for way longer than we intended to and again it went awesome. He again seemed like he really liked me so far and we again talked about what we‚Äôd do the following weekend and decided we could tease out the details later on in the week. But before we hung up we agreed that we were both really busy and wanted to focus on the stuff we had to do this week so we could have a great time together in person. He said maybe we could talk briefly during the week. We didn‚Äôt want to hang up lol but agreed we‚Äôd talk soon.

I texted him the following night and he answered relatively quickly and made a joke we made up the night before. We had a brief exchange but it tapered off bc I was really busy and couldn‚Äôt stick around. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. The next day (yesterday) I didn‚Äôt hear from him, which didn‚Äôt bother me bc I figured he was busy and didn‚Äôt want to set up a routine of texting every single day anyway.

Today‚Äôs the real doozy. I didn‚Äôt plan to text him but I realized I had something going on the day we had planned to go out so I asked if we could switch to the following day instead. He didn‚Äôt read the message for over an hour, which I found odd because he usually answered pretty quickly. He finally responded and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúhey sorry I‚Äôm really busy this weekend and I have a lot of stuff going on. I should be good after but I‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù I responded with only a ‚Äúokay no prob‚Äù but again it‚Äôs been like 4 hours and he hasn‚Äôt even opened it. 

I find this so confusing tbh. I‚Äôm kinda thinking he‚Äôs changed his mind somehow and is kinda avoiding me now? I just feel like if he really wanted to see me he‚Äôd find a way to make time. Also, the fact that he didn‚Äôt think he could hang out and didn‚Äôt bother to bring it up until I said something makes me again think he‚Äôs avoiding me. Finally the tone of the message seems like it‚Äôs super distant though usually he seemed a lot warmer in his texts. I‚Äôm kinda stunned by how he seems to have done a 180 in such a short period of time especially since it seemed like there was absolutely nothing wrong the other day. I‚Äôve racked my brains and don‚Äôt think I said or did anything wrong...usually I end up doing something cringy but this time around I really don‚Äôt think I did. 

Do the vibes I‚Äôm picking up seem accurate? Does it seem like he‚Äôs even bs‚Äôing me about letting me know later? I have a feeling I‚Äôm not gonna hear back from him.

I‚Äôm thinking I should wait until the weekend‚Äôs over and message him and be like ‚Äúare you still up for this or no?‚Äù Would that be helpful to the situation or should I just leave it?

(F24) I‚Äôm seeing a guy (m29) we hooked up three times, he takes me out, brings me things (he brought me my favorite tea when I wasn‚Äôt feeling good), is always complimenting me, paying for me, etc. we have so much in common, but he is a terrible texter. Maybe like 2-3 times a day, but I see that he‚Äôs on Facebook sometimes without responding to my texts, and I get a little irritated. When he does respond, his messages are a little dry and boring.

After writing all this, I feel like I‚Äôm kinda over analyzing a bit. It‚Äôs just getting to the point where I don‚Äôt want to dwell on this guy if he‚Äôs just messing around with me, and I read other posts where guys said if they were interested in a girl, they would definitely text them back and be excited to.

I said I was up for it, and we continued talking for a bit longer. I then said I had to get ready to go out.

Now a over month later Alex and I have been hanging out and talking more as friends. Like, she actually reaches out to me to talk and asks to hang out and as a result I‚Äôve been starting to develop a ‚Äúcrush‚Äù for Alex. People almost never reach out to me, much less ask me if I want to hang out so I feel like this ‚Äúcrush‚Äù might also just be me jumping the gun and getting way too excited as a result for a desperate want for affection and companionship. 

I don‚Äôt want to ruin this potentially great friendship. But I don‚Äôt know if I should tell her how I feel when even I don‚Äôt know how I really feel. She‚Äôs also going through some stuff right now and has some drama going on with other people I‚Äôm not super close friends with or anything but nonetheless know and see kind of often. 

I know from past relationships and just time what I look for and want in a partner and relationship and I just have this feeling that even if I was able to get into a romantic relationship with Alex that it wouldn‚Äôt work out. 

Despite this I keep imagining myself with her both romantically and also just being together in general like cuddling and holding hands and wanting to give it a shot. I guess my question is is if I should tell her and be honest now or wait and see if this ‚Äúcrush‚Äù passes and if it‚Äôs still there then tell her about it?

TLDR: I might have a crush on a friend I‚Äôm not sure would actually work with as a romantic relationship and wondering if I should tell her now or wait and see if I still have feelings for her.",dating_advice

t3_dls6ej,Im (24m) on the fence about my relationship (26f),"People of reddit, Id like some advice if any one can shed some light. I started dating this girl 2.5 years ago, ive been through alot in the beginning with her. Every couple of months I get a immense urge to break up with her (broke up twice and got back together) . When I first started dating her it became rough very quickly, she would blow up and completely shut down on me (jealousy issues, accuse me of cheating etc. ridiculous shit) Shes done alot thats hurt me mentally and caused insecurities I never had before in the beginning (googling how she wants to cheat, how she thinks im gay, trying to control me). Never could find out if she cheated. Puts on acts with different groups (friends, parents) making me think maybe shes just acting and this isnt her real self. But as our relationship prolonged she got help with her anxiety and borderline personality disorder and things got better. Things were good for about the past 1.5 years. As for the present now, she never leaves the house and doesn't hang out with friends (still uses her friends and only hangs out is she needs something), I try to encourage these traits.  Originally I was always pushing for her to come out and do stuff with me (said I sound like a gf) she hasn't been outside in three weeks. Now I prefer she didn't come out and do stuff with me. Like a escape, I feel extremely annoyed and angry 50% of the time. I feel unhappy and see other girls I find attractive and think ""I wonder if I'd be happier of I was dating someone else"". Though that could just be a grass is greener complex. I guess I feel stuck, I care for her and Im so damn proud of how far shes come (mental stability) but I am just unsure if I want to be with her forever. If things can get better.

t3_dlp27l,I (23M) don't know what I feel about a girl I met (20F),"3 days ago I met a girl on an app , typical stuff we just met on the same day we started talking . 
It went well and we kissed and hugged a lot , she was amazed by how fast she felt calm and comfortable with me , we met the very next day and spend it together at my flat , we cooked food , we started making out to some romantic music and it became essentially forplay , she tried initiating sex and I stopped her , I said I think it's to fast I want her to really feel comfortable sleeping with me I said we'll sleep some other day , it followed with me giving her a full body massage naked (I know her for less then 24 hours), after that I offered to take a shower together , and we went on and showered together with candle light , music , and passionate kissing.

She left , she texted ""thanks for today , can't remember the last time I was so calm and happy"" 
She felt like it was a dream
She stated to me she isn't looking for something serious after her past relationships ended badly.

We met the very next day (third in a row) and eventually I allowed myself to sleep with her because I felt she felt comfortable with me and it wasn't just ""the heat of the moment"".

It was really good and passionate and we learned more about each other. 
We lied in bed and started taking , she asked me with how many woman I've been and I said something like 8 in the last year , she instantly started crying asking ""so it doesn't mean anything to you?"" , I started crying üòÖ telling it does that's why I stopped her yesterday and if I only wanted that I could of managed to get it yesterday , I was bombarded with all kind of questions like ""what do you feel""? , ""What did you feel when you first saw me / kissed me "" , ""why I never been in a relationship"" , ""why do I like her"" , ""what do I want , what am I searching for"" etc. 
It was hard for me to answer all this but she looked satisfied with the answers (just said the truth honestly), and opened up to her.
I escorted her home and we had more wierd ""we really like each other vibes"". 
Now I can only see her a week from now 
I am really confused with what's going on , I have many FWB and I feel I have to put them on hold , but then she says she isn't looking for anything but she almost clearly cares about it. 

I am miserable because I carve the human contact and it was cut and now I have to wait , not touching anything else.

t3_dls4i7,"Feeling bad about myself, just need help dealing with a situation","So I (17 m) asked a girl (16 f) to the homecoming dance and she had said yes, however we weren't sure if it was going to be a friend thing or a date thing.  At the dance, we were getting along pretty well, and I asked if she would prefer it to be a friend thing or a date thing (we had been hanging out beforehand and a few days before the dance.  She said, ""I like you,"" to which I assumed she meant as a date (my mistake).  

After the dance, I asked her if she'd be down for a second date going to a park and playing disc golf, and she responded, ""I'd never done that, but ok!""  I assumed that this for sure meant we were dating (my mistake again).

Later on she asks me if I think we're dating, which I did, and she discloses that she doesn't want to date anyone for understandable, personal reasons that won't be disclosed here.

 I don't blame her for any of this, but I feel like an asshole for assuming.  But also, during the 3 day period in which I had thought we were dating, I was the happiest I'd ever been.  We really clicked personality-wise, and hanging out with her calmed my anxiety about pretty much everything.  After she clarified that we weren't dating, I feel horrible and depressed.  We're still good friends, and she said that I didn't do anything wrong, but I don't even know what to do.  Normally I take rejection pretty well, but I just feel empty now.  

I'm sure this sounds overly dramatic, but this is my 12th rejection (in a row), and none of them have felt this bad before.  I think it is mainly because if it weren't for her unchangeable reason that she can't date anyone, I think we would have been an amazing match for each other.  

Girl who will remain unidentified, if you read this, I don't hold you responsible at all for this situation, it's entirely on me.

Does anyone have any advice on how to move on or stop feeling like an idiot?  At this point, I'm honestly not sure I want to keep asking people out, I think I've reaching my breaking point.  After she clarified, I had an anxiety attack and my friends tried to help me out but to no avail.  It was worse than the time that strangers got into my car and forced me to drive them an hour across town.

I really honestly need some help dealing with this, or words of encouragement, or something? To put it simply, I need help.",dating_advice

So I‚Äôve been talking to this girl in my math class in college for a little bit. Last week, I invited her to go to Knotts scary farm and she said yes. However, she had to cancel because of complications with money. Today, I was going to ask her if she was okay with me spotting her ( I would have paid but she takes pride in paying things herself). However, for some reason, I just did not want to talk to her at all today. Like I was happy and fine in the morning, but once I sat down next to her in class I just didn‚Äôt feel like talking it was fucking strange. Because of this, I missed my chance of asking her if I could spot her and it was awkward because we didn‚Äôt talk.

t3_dls3gx,"Been dating for a month, things are really slow emotionally","How do I get this girl to really fall for me

We're already dating, we'll have been dating for a month on the 28th. We started talking sometime early September over Tinder. We're at the phase where we're getting to know each other, and while we acknowledge that we're in a relationship it still very much feels like a friendship. Neither of us are the head-over-heels-since-the-first-time-we've-met type so I'm not surprised that we both aren't super attached to each other, but this makes me feel uneasy because she might get bored. I'm really worried that we both see this as just a friendship that we slapped the ""dating"" label on. I feel a lot of potential in this but I think we need a shove towards the right direction.  I've also been friends with people that eventually did turn into really big crushes so I'm not ruling out that we just haven't known each other long enough.

He is in a superior position to me, but we‚Äôre the same age and I really like him/am attracted to him. I think he‚Äôs attracted to me, but I know he won‚Äôt overstep that boundary. I just want to know if this is a crush I should hold onto and reach out to him when I quit or/hope he will when we don‚Äôt work together (I do plan on leaving by early next year). 

These are just some signs, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just having wishful thinking: 

-He stares at me across the floor and if I‚Äôm speaking to someone else or laughing, I can feel him looking at me or kind of makes his way over to the conversation if he‚Äôs free. 

-He does treat me differently than my other co workers. If I need help, he‚Äôs on it right away. As with others he‚Äôd brush them aside. 

-He‚Äôs asked me how long my ex and I were together (when we were still dating). When my ex would come into our work and I‚Äôd clearly be upset over something, he would ask if I‚Äôm okay or in a silly voice say ‚Äúboys‚Äù and roll his eyes... when he said that once I didn‚Äôt even know he was paying attention to me or saw my ex there with me. 

-When we do get into a conversation, we are pretty similar and if it were outside of work I would be interested in him (I‚Äôm assuming maybe the same for him?) 

-The biggest thing is just feeling him stare at me across the floor. I don‚Äôt feel that from others, and he‚Äôll keep making eye contact if I look in the same way. 

-sometimes if he walks past me, I‚Äôll just grin/smile and he‚Äôll do the same and kind of laugh. 


Like I said, I‚Äôd rather keep it professional and not date a co worker... it‚Äôs just sometimes exciting to think he might feel the same way.

t3_dlffpd,"How to thrive in the dating world when you've never established yourself as a sexual being, or never had someone show interest?","Hey, I am a 21yo male who has never had sex, kissed a girl, held hands etc. In my youth I have missed out on about any (sexual) experience with the other sex that you can come up with. I did have a crush for a very long time but she didn't even know I existed. On average, I was about 2 years younger than my class mates ever since elementary, which was pretty difficult for me.

I find it weird to think about dating or read about romantic/sexual stories. It's foreign to me, like it's from another world. I have never had a girl show clear interest in me, for one thing. It's like I have never established myself as a sexual being. When I was younger, I was afraid to come across as creepy or needy because of my age and I didn't recognise the fact that I as a human being have needs like intimacy and love until pretty recently. I feel like growing up this way damages you mentally to the point where I am actively hurting my chances of finding what I want because it scares me. Lying next to a girl? That is alien to me, like it has never existed. Sex? Not gonna happen! Because I never really tried when I was younger (and when I did, I was hurt/rejected massively), it feels like it is futile anyways because nobody has ever wanted me after all. This entire new layer of life, romance, has never existed, like it's another dimension I cannot enter.

t3_dlonmm,Hookup (M23) who ghosted me (F21) has resurfaced again and it's left me confused.,"So I posted on a separate thread about a month ago and it was basically this :

\[So long story short, met him on Tinder (he's 23M and I'm 21F) and we hit it off from the first conversation we had on there. We sleep together quite regularly but on top of that he's been doing these things

\- Facetimes me 3-4 times a week for an hour before he goes to bed and we talk about basically anything. Same with texting except we text everyday and he starts the convo/always replies quickly even at work.

\- When I had to go to hospital for an emergency he seemed genuinely concerned, when I was alone in my flat over the summer he asked if I was okay and on a night out when he made a comment that upset me, the next morning the first thing he did was apologise.

\- When he's stayed over night he's confided in me about things he's insecure about, how much he misses his mum and how him being closed off has stopped him from settling down (then been very boyfriendy physically i.e. cuddling, forehead kisses etc.)

\- He's made jokes about us two being boyfriend and girlfriend

\- On his birthday he messaged if he could come see me because drama in his family had popped up.

Whenever I hinted about what we were he always dismissed it as ""purely sexual"" when it wasn't by any means\]

Anyway about a month or so ago  he came over, we slept together and we were cuddling and he was walking around my room and looking at my books whilst we were chatting. And he said, ""You said you were shy around guys but you're not shy around me."" I replied saying I'd known him for a while so I obviously wasn't going to be shy. He said, ""Do you really know me though?"". He put his clothes back on whilst repeating that I'd pissed him off and he stormed out. I was super confused and I tried reaching out to him for about a week but I got nothing from him so I stopped. 

Anyway I noticed he's been checking my social media (whilst I haven't been checking his). I didn't make anything of it until two or three days ago I saw whilst accidentally clicking on his update he was running past where I do rowing. When I checked with a friend who was at the rowing club at the time (was just asking her if she had a good day), she described a guy exactly like him looks wise ran past the entrance a few times and glanced at the entrance a few times before leaving. He lives about a half an hour walk from where I do rowing and he told me he always did running around the city centre where he lives just because it was easier.

t3_dlrdyj,"We never defined the relationship. I still have feelings for him, but I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs moved on.","I (28/M) have been hanging out with this guy, let‚Äôs call him Randy (40/M), for about one year. We met on an app and chatted for about 6 weeks before I finally met him in person. Due to the distance between us (about an hour drive), we only saw each other a few times during the first two months. However, I could tell there was a connection between us. We continued hanging out when we could, and we eventually started seeing each other more often. During the spring and early summer, things were going really well, and I kind of assumed we were ‚Äúseeing each other‚Äù, even though we never had that conversation. I really wanted to ‚Äúdefine the relationship‚Äù and have that talk, but I was afraid I would scare him off. I was happy with the way things were, I knew that labeling our relationship wouldn‚Äôt really change much (in terms of how often we see each other and talk), and I was pretty confident he wasn‚Äôt trying to see other people (neither was I). Also, I was naively assuming he would initiate the talk because he‚Äôs older and more experienced. For all of these reasons, I put off having ‚Äúthe talk.‚Äù

A few months ago, I noticed little things begin to change. He became a little less affectionate, we wouldn‚Äôt hang out as much, and when we would go out for dinner or drinks, the conversation did not flow as easily as before. One night, after dropping me off at home, he texted me and asked if we had a status. I instantly became tense and anxious because I was expecting the worst, and because this seemingly came out of nowhere. I told him we haven‚Äôt talked about it, but I would love to have that conversation. He texted me back and said he thought we were in the friends category. I immediately asked if we could talk instead of text, so I called him. We ended up having an emotional conversation about a lot of stuff going on in his life at the moment ‚Äì friends, family, his job ‚Äì and we didn‚Äôt really talk about our status. During the next few weeks after that conversation, things were relatively normal. We still texted and hung out the same amount as before, and the topic didn‚Äôt come up. I wanted to bring it up and continue the conversation, but there wasn‚Äôt a good time (in my opinion). So I put it off.

To back track a little, a few months after we started hanging out, Randy went to Europe for vacation. He ended up meeting a guy there on one of the first days (let‚Äôs call him Anthony), and apparently they instantly hit it off. Anthony hung out with Randy and his friends on a few of his excursions, and when it was time to leave, they decided to keep in touch. During the time when things were going really well with me and Randy, I would occasionally see texts pop up from Anthony, but I figured he was an old friend or something. I never knew how they met.

Fast forward to my emotional conversation with Randy‚Ä¶ one of the things he mentioned was that his friend Anthony was coming to visit soon, and that he really liked him. When I heard that, I had a mini panic attack. Why did he just tell me he liked someone? I thought he liked me? We didn‚Äôt spend much time on that topic, but I remembered he said it, and that stuck with me for the next few weeks.

Fast forward to last month ‚Äì Anthony comes to visit. Leading up to his visit, as I mentioned before, things were relatively normal between me and Randy. I wanted to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù, but I didn‚Äôt see a good opportunity to have it. When Anthony arrived, I gave Randy his space to enjoy the visit. I didn‚Äôt text him at all during the week-long visit, and he never texted me. However, Randy posted most of the visit on social media, so I got to see exactly what they were doing.

Every new post and picture that I saw of the two of them broke my heart a little bit more. During the year-or-so that Randy and I were ‚Äútogether‚Äù, he never posted about us on social media, and he didn‚Äôt have many pictures of us together saved on his phone. Now Anthony comes to visit and he posts selfies and pictures of every place they go. I was extremely jealous and pretty miserable the whole week.

When Anthony finally left, Randy texted me and we began to communicate as normal. I knew that I needed to talk to him about how I felt, so I went over to his house one night to watch a movie. Before the movie, we decided to order food, so he opened an app on his phone, put in his order, and then handed me the phone to place my order. He left the room to use the bathroom, and I had a very strong urge to snoop through his pictures to see what I could find, so I did. The reason I did so was because I guess I wanted to confirm what I already thought, but didn‚Äôt want to admit ‚Äì that Randy sees us as friends and nothing more. Well, I guess I got what I asked for. There were pictures/videos of them doing things they didn‚Äôt post about, selfies of them kissing, and even some x-rated videos. My heart literally sank into my stomach and I started to have a panic attack. Randy came back and saw that I wasn‚Äôt myself, and that‚Äôs when I finally told him we need to talk.

I asked him what he thought about us and the past year. He said that there were times when he wanted to take our relationship to the next level, and he was looking for signs from me that indicated I wanted to do the same. I absolutely wanted to take things to the next level, but as I said above, I was afraid I would scare him off and I didn‚Äôt want to mess up what we had going. Therefore, he interpreted my actions as not wanting to take the next step and just stay where we were. So I guess he assumed I wanted to stay more as friends, which is not at all what I wanted. However, since neither of us said anything to one another over the next few months, we both kept assuming what the relationship was. I assumed we were ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù but not exactly boyfriends, and he assumed we were nothing more than friends or FWB. Now there is someone else in the picture that Randy clearly has feelings for. I tried to ask Randy about him and Anthony and what he considered them to be, and he said that he is unsure. He‚Äôs unsure whether to pursue a relationship, or just let it go because of the distance.

I left the conversation in an OK headspace, but when I got home, I completely broke down. I‚Äôve been an anxious, miserable wreck for the past week thinking about how I missed my chance with Randy. How we both had feelings for each other and all it took was for one of us to say something. Or would that have even mattered because he had been texting Anthony the whole time we were ‚Äútogether‚Äù? I feel extremely guilty for snooping through Randy‚Äôs phone, and I can‚Äôt get the pictures/videos out of my head. Does Randy still have feelings for me? He did at one point, and we‚Äôve remained friends this whole time. Is he going to move to Europe to try and make it work with Anthony? Or are they not going to try and make it work?

I asked Randy if we can continue our conversation this weekend and he agreed. **I guess I‚Äôm looking for advice about the situation in general and potential questions I can ask Randy**. So far this is what I have:

¬∑ I still really like you and have feelings for you. Do you still have feelings for me? Or is the door shut on us and you‚Äôre trying to make the relationship with Anthony work?

¬∑ I feel very guilty about snooping through his phone and I‚Äôm wondering if I should confess?

¬∑ Should I ask about Anthony? Or will the details of their relationship just make me feel worse?

I like to think that I'm confident and funny (I make myself laugh and someone's gotta have the same humour right) but also don't have too much issues with starting conversations with people. 

I'm always usually talking to someone on some level whether I've met them in person or through a dating app. Yet whenever I seem to get remotely close to someone (a few dates or flirtier messages) things seem to fizzle out for whatever reason. 

Recently I've had a few people literally block me on every social media mid-conversation which sends my mind into overdrive as from my end I can't understand what's gone wrong.

t3_dlneam,Canceled a plan I wanted to do with a girl I met on mdma and can‚Äôt really reschedule it soon without it being weird.,"Last week I met an interesting girl at a party. We have a friend in common. 

We cuddled and kissed after the party but didn‚Äôt have sex. The moment was more cute and warm then sexual and we were both tired. She gave me her telephone number.

I live 2 hours away from her and from said party but I will probably have an internship in her city this winter. 

I was supposed to have an interview in her city today, so I texted her to see her in the same time. But it got canceled. 

I wanted to go see her anyway, but I felt like it was ridiculous to drive 4 hours to see a girl I met on mdma, so I explained her the situation and I canceled our plans. 

Now, I feel stupid for doing that because I want to see her and I have the time to do it, but I can‚Äôt really tell her that I want to go see her anyway because it is weird, unsmooth and too much. I have to mention that when she accepted to have a drink with me, she told we she was not looking for a boyfriend.

t3_dlna5n,Ghosted or over thinking?,"So I‚Äôm 24(F) and I went on a bumble date (w/ 26M) on Sunday evening. We‚Äôd only be talking a little over a week, but both thought getting to know each other is better in person. We have each other on both snapchat and WhatsApp and had been snapping things from our days to each other, and messaging back and forth, never too fast though as we‚Äôre both busy working full time. Just to clarify, a few hours between messages doesn‚Äôt bother me whatsoever, I get life gets hectic and we‚Äôre not all on our phones all day. Anyway, the date.

We met at a local bar for a drink and conversation was great from the get go, then we walked further into town for dinner, we shared a starter and had our own mains, we got to know each other on a better level, talking about our jobs and goals, and all the lighthearted banter too. At the end we even decided to share a dessert when he could tell I wanted one! He refused to let me split the bill and told me a I should never pay for the first date. He walked me back to my car and even offered his arm for me to hold onto. We hugged goodbye, and I said thank you for the evening, he told me to let me know when I get home safe &amp; kissed my cheek.

I text him shortly after getting in (no clue how to play it cool haha) thanking him again saying I had a great time, and an hour or so later he texts back saying he had a lovely night. I reply the next morning general chit chat, knowing he is off of work this week I know not to expect instant responses, plus work for me is keeping me busy so again cool. Expect not cool, as I haven‚Äôt heard back anything from lunch time yesterday. I‚Äôm trying my best not to be labelled as crazy keen, but I can see he is online and posting snapchat stories. I haven‚Äôt gone back again as I can see he has read it, but I‚Äôm now a little confused. Did I do something wrong? 

I have been fully ghosted in the past after a few dates and even when I tried to confront the guy I heard nothing back, and it really knocked me back. I completely understand that nobody owes me anything, and that it was only one date after a week of chatting. But I do feel like if this what online dating is, I‚Äôm going to tap out.

t3_dlqcpo,Sexless relationship,"My boyfriend of almost 2 years wont have sex with me.

Let me start from the beginning... before I met him I was in a long term relationship for almost 5 years. We had a great sex life, very active and healthy. We liked to try new things and always had a great time. 

I met my current boyfriend through and cheated with him (we kissed). I break up with said EX. I moved into this new relationship pretty fast. I fell in love, HARD. Things were great, we had so much fun together. We got serious pretty fast.

I moved out for the first time and two months into the lease he asked me to move in with him, so i did. Then things start to get a little strange, not in the fact that we didn't love each other but he was slowly pulling away sexually. Now it has gotten to the point where we will go 6 months at a time without sex. Not because I dont want to, I try every night and he said I make it 'uncomfortable' and 'weird'. There were times he would cover my face with his hand in the middle because he didn't want me looking at him.

He told me it isn't me, he just doesn't want to have sex? he says he is attracted to me but would rather just masterbate (SELFISH). Now... to me that is weird, and let me be honest I am dying because I want to be with him and only him. It is hard when you dont receive any physical contact, and no real answers. I offered an open relationship, he doesn't want that. Ive looked though his phone, I know he isn't cheating.. is it me? 

I want to have fun, I want to be kinky. I told him I will try anything to make it fun, and still nothing.

What is happening and will it ever get better? I am thinking intimacy issues.. thoughts?",dating_advice

t3_dlkxha,Damn Online dating is rough,"So I‚Äôm trying to build up myself confidence and I made a Tinder account for the purpose of meeting women just to find stuff to do as well as fishing for a potential partner maybe.

It started well when I started getting tons of matches but it went downhill when nobody started answering my messages. It pretty much hit the climax when I matched with someone and we started getting along really well and were making plans to meet. She asked me what I did for work and I told her I was between jobs. She didn‚Äôt take it too well and she started insulting me saying that men with no jobs should not be dating and that I was a deadbeat loser. I reported her in anger but then she unmatched me cause I couldn‚Äôt see any of her messages again.

I‚Äôve now deleted the app because it really hurt what she said and I‚Äôm not back to square one of not having any methods to improve my social connections when it comes to having friends who are girls.

t3_dlq5iy,Is this going too fast?,"So I met this guy through a dating app, I know, I was skeptical too. But when we went on the date, we hit it right off. We agreed to go out on another date a week late. At the end of the first date, we kissed. We couldn't wait to see each other and ended up going on a two dates in between the week. Fast forward two weeks, now we are in a relationship and it is going so well that we are terrified.

The catch is this guy is two years older than me, no big deal, but he just got out of an 8 year relationship 2 months ago. After the first date he disclosed to me about it and he told me about how awful she was to him. He said everything about being with me is different from how it felt with her. I asked him if he would ever go back to her, and he swore he wouldn't. He broke up with her before his family could force him to marry her. 

Now we are a couple and every second together is amazing. His step mom is convinced (she's crazy about astrology) that we dated in another life time and we were meant to find each other. When we are alone, we constantly ask each other where we have been all our lives. We could feel ourselves slowly planning our lives together. I know this is crazy fast, but I honestly like everything about him, I have never met a human being that understands me as well as he does. 

Unfortunately, due to him just recently getting out of his relationship with his ex, everyone thinks he is an idiot for ever leaving her. He never disclosed to his family or friend about how emotional abusive she was. His family wouldn't understand that he is dating someone else so we are keeping our relationship a secret. I know how awful this sounds, even I'm insecure about this, but there is no way we can just break up and forget about each other at this rate. We are too attached and fond of each other for that now. 

I'm also in a tough situation with my family so we are both hiding our relationship. The only ones that know about us are our friends and his step mother. He lives with his family which makes it really risky when we go on dates and they don't know where he is. 

My friends all think we are moving really fast, but this guys is the best man I have ever dated and he wants to treat me right. He knows that I'm not straight, I'm a demi-sexual, so when we are in the bedroom together, the chemistry is completely there. I'm the only other girl he's been with other than his ex which makes me nervous because even after his break up, he never went out, never partied or went clubbing, or slept around. 

He is now trying to shape his future better, he wants to graduate university like I did. He wants to get a job that he loves just like I did. He tells me I make him happy in ways his ex never could. We don't want to talk about our feelings too much because we know it's too soon but we know just by being together than we are falling hard and fast for each other. 

I'm so confused because I was always the person hating on sappy, lovey dovey couples, but we have became just like that. I'm aware everything is fast, and no one from his family is going to approve of me because of his recent breakup. What would you do in this situation?",dating_advice
t3_dlmt0r,"I don't know what to do, please help","(Throw away account incase anyone I know recognises anything)

So I started my (M21) first job three years ago. There was another person (F33) that I started to really get along with. I started falling for her instantly. The problem was, at the time she was married. However some time passed and she has gone through divorce. For a while now we have hung out (going out to concerts and exhibits) a couple of times. Sometimes I feel like she is being flirty but I can't tell if that's just her being nice like she always is or if she is into me. I feel like the age difference is too much for her and she sees me more like a little brother than anything.

I am afraid of directly asking her directly because I really like her as a friend and I don't want to ruin that either. She is the first person I've had this much of a deep and personal connection with. Also we work quite closely together everyday and any awkwardness would potentially ruin both of our time at work. 

As a side note I have never had a relationship and I am quite bad at taking to girls romantically. I used to be bad at talking to girls in general before I became friends with her.

What do you guys think I should do? Is the age gap already a red flag and I should keep quiet and forget it? Or are there enough signs to say that it's worth a shot to potentially make my workplace too awkward?

t3_dlmo1d,I'm awful at reading people so maybe some advice please?,"So i didn't want to like this guy but i think i do now. The reason I didn't want to is because I know it won't happen, even if he likes me back the logistics of it all won't work,and I think he might realise that too, but I still wanna know. So like not long after we first met he messaged me and we got talking all night and he didn't see me for a while so messaged me another two times and began to be obviously flirtatious in these messages. I was never the first to message until I did once but the conversation ended really early. Anyway, it's bee a few months and he hasn't messaged me since but i see him once or twice a week.I just can't tell if I am special to him or if he is just like this with everyone. So whenever I say him he will always say hi to me and stuff and he'll playfully tease me a lot and I'll do the same back to him, but some of the stuff he says to me he'll also say to my friends. However, the difference is he'll actually try and talk to me when we're alone, but only ever when we're alone. He'll also be extra playful physically when we're alone. He usually always laughs at what I say and we always make eye contact or he'll smile at me in this certain way. The only thing is though, I obviously don't know if he is also like this with my friends because I don't know what they're like alone. I also can't help but feel that I've kinda pushed him away a little bit because i wasn't really being very flirty in text and I kinda rely heavily on jokes and teasing in conversation because i'm quite awkward so i haven't really held a serious conversation very well. I mean I really don't know what to think of it because i rarely get any attention from guys so I can barely tell if he likes me or is treating me the same as everyone else. I kinda wanna ask my friend about it but there's a very high chance that if I do that, that she'll make it very obvious when we're next together, or she'll get jealous and try and prove that she gets attention from him too.

I can't sleep properly, i go to bed at 1:00 am and I only fall asleep after a few hours (3:00am - 4:00am). This may sound weird ... but during these few hours I imagine being with her, telling her about my feeling, marrying her, hanging out with her, doing anything I can only imagine with her (nothing dirty tho). I ... really can't stop thinking about her, I've been checking her Instagram stories whole last month. Actually, I have a crush on her not because she is hot or anything like that, but because I truly like her personality and I fell in love with her charming smile ü•∞. She is unique for me, somehow she can easily manage to motivate and inpire people around her. She is clever, beautiful, and most importantly she motivates me (her page is a like a blog, where she shares with others her life stories, ideas and helps other by answering all their questions, she is so kind...). The last time, when I had this kind of feeling, it was 10 years ago, when I was still in a high school (14y old). I am 24 years old, never had any serious relationship due to being socially awkward/foreigner in another country (I am studying in EU). So, that's why I am writing all of this here, I could use your help.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, I can deal with my shit all alone by myself, never needed a helping hand, been living here for 6 years alone without (true) friends and it was okay, but I simply can't sort out this alone. As I said, it's been a long time since I last time felt this way.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why i like her is: As you already know she is amazing, and  actually, she is from the same country/same city I am from, but she currently studies in another part of the planet (South Korea). I really like her because she is so dedicated, smart and even though she studies architecture in one of the Korea's most difficult universities (SKY), she someshow always manages to remain positive and in all of her photos she is always smiling, happy. I've never met her in person, neither in my home country, nor after finding out about her existence. For the first time in my life I actually want to be with someone, with her to be precise. I want to marry her. But for now, I can't really do it, can't neither support her finacially, nor give her a bright future. I am unemployed, need to get my Master's degree first and then look for a job (granted if I even find one). Don't really know what to do, she doesn't even know about my feelings. And let's suppose that I will be able to find a job in 2 years and earn some money to pay for a flight to Seoul + accommodation, that's in the best case scenario, provided I get my degree and find a good job. In 2 years everything can happen: she will no longer be there (she is 3rd year student now and I guess only 2 years are left until she graduates), during that time she might find other man, someone who is close, marry him, I don't know ... I mean, she is beautiful, smart and people are drawn to her like a magnet, there aren't many girls like her, at least in a country, where I come from. And even if I will find a job and go to there to tell her about my feelings, I don't know how she will react. This is actually worrying me, I never had a girlfriend during my stay here and even during my time at school, yeah I am a sore loser lol. I wasn't really interested in finding someone, building relationship and been concentrated on my studies, but I haven't been able to concentrate at all last month, this is distracting me all the time. I can't just simply stop thinking about her and it's depressing me. Can't really describe what i feel really, I think you need to experience the same thing to understand what I am going through...

&amp;#x200B;

I ask myself, would she even be slightly interested in someone this ugly, fat, less intelligent (than her) like me? This might sound like I am exaggerating and all, but I never felt confident in myself. She can have her choice of men, I bet there would a full queue of men, who want to be with her, and I am not really a competitive person, to say the least. For the first time in my life I really need someone's advice, I know that here are people, who are older than me and probably experienced something similar, so if you could share some advice, I would really appreciate it! Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify: I think that I've found a woman with whom I want to spend the rest of my life, but I don't really want to intervene into her life, if it turns out that she doesn't give a damn about my existence. I don't know what should I do and I hate going through all of this and experiencing it.

I'm not really one to chase hard and I have way too much pride. So I feel like I shouldn't message her to see what's up. I don't mind if she's not keen anymore but an explanation would be nice.

t3_dllxp7,How does a 22 year old guy get a girlfriend?,"I feel embarrassed to be writing this because I should know better by now, but I'm in a dark place. I've made a lot of progress over the last few years. I used to be a stereotypical severely depressed loner, the kind of guy the media warns you about. The good news is I've gone from severely depressed to mildly depressed. I've discovered my passion in life, making movies, and I've worked hard for years to make my dream a reality. I've traveled the world, had some amazing adventures. I've built up a network of friends who really get me and that's such a wonderful feeling. I've been told plenty of times how funny I am, how cute I am, how talented, how handsome...

I'm not saying this to be narcissistic. I'm saying this because I feel like I'm doing everything right, but I wind up in the same boat. I feel happiest when I'm working or traveling because I'm *doing* something. The visceral thrill of writing for hours and getting a scene just right or blasting through a whitewater rapid makes me feel alive. It's all about forgetting my inner demons. My strategy was to wait until I'm more successful to start dating so I'd have a much better chance. I'm so close, but without getting into details, my big project has been delayed by two months. That means two more months of living with who I am.

My first instinct was to go on another trip to escape, but I have to stay home so I don't jeopardize my project. The last few days, I've slid back into depression because I can't scramble ahead. The gaping lack of affection in my life blares at me. I'm no virgin. I've been with girls, but not in a way that really counts. I don't just want sex, I don't want one night stands. I want a real relationship, a girl I can feel close to.

I realize 22 is a tough age because you're not teenage / college age anymore, but you can't quite compete with successful adults. I blew my chances with girls at college because I was too depressed and socially incompetent. Now I get the rules of the game, but I'm still an introvert with high-functioning Asperger's. Bars and parties aren't for me. Online dating seems like the obvious solution, but I get the sense that most people my age are on Tinder and that's the opposite of what I'm looking for. If I just wanted sex, I'd cut out the middleman and pay a professional.

I hope you understand my situation. Nothing would make me happier than finding a nice girl to settle down with. If I come across as too serious and intense, it's because I am, but I still have a sense of humor about myself. Maybe I could afford to enjoy myself a little more.",dating_advice

t3_dljx5m,Girlfriend follows other guys on Instagram who she meets when she is out with friends. Is this ok?,"My girlfriend is an outwardly flirty and sexual person, and I am not.

t3_dlp3ql,Started seeing a girl and not sure how often I should be messaging her?,"I (23M) just had my first date ever in my life with this cute girl (27F) last Friday and we really hit it off because we found out we have so much in common.  We both love anime, comics, video games, star wars, etc and we talked for hours at a restaurant to the point where we were the last ones to leave and only left because we felt bad for the employees waiting for us so they could close.  

I already have 2 more dates planned out for the next two weeks.  Before I met her I was already planning to go to two comic and anime conventions and asked her if she wanted to join me and she said yes to both.   I bought her a ticket for one of the Cons and she bought a ticket for the other.  Before then though I wanted to go on more dates to talk but she messaged me saying she has a fever and can't meet up for more dates until she gets better.  

Now since this is my first time dating a girl I don't know how often I should be messaging her and about what?   I've already messaged her saying I hope she feels better but that's it and can't really think of how to start any new conversation as I don't want to seem like I'm bothering her.  I don't want to mess this up as I really like this girl and feel bad for not messaging her to keep her engaged in conversation.  We meet up in 5 days for our first convention this Sunday but I don't want to not talk to her for 5 more days until then. 

What if she loses interest or thinks I'm boring? But I also don't want to just start asking random questions like what's her favorite color or something like that just for the sake of conversation.  Plus I want to get to know her better in person rather than over the phone.   We initially planned 2 more dates for yesterday and Wednesday but because of her fever she had to cancel.  

Pretty much I'm asking is it okay for me to just not message her for 5 more days until we meet up or what should I message her about in the meantime to keep her attention. I'm sorry for this long post and if it seems like a dumb question but remember I'm totally new to this and this is the first girl in my life that decided to go a date with me.",dating_advice

The next day we decided to call it a ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù but she already removed my name in her social media apps, and changed our relationship to ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù on Facebook and set it to private.

When she was a junior and Nick was a senior in high school, they went to her prom together. She later admitted that they had feelings for each other at the time and seriously talked about dating, but decided not to because the timing was bad, with Nick about to go to college and all that. While that was going on, I secretly liked Nick but decided my friend‚Äôs feelings towards her almost-boyfriend were more important than my little crush. Anyway, life happened such that even though we‚Äôre all in college now, we‚Äôre pretty much in the same geographic location and see each other pretty often. Jessie has explicitly stated that she is no longer interested in dating Nick. They have a solid platonic friendship these days, and she clearly prefers that over a potential romantic relationship with him. However, she doesn‚Äôt know that I never fully got over my crush on Nick, and he and I are totally hitting it off. I‚Äôm hesitant to ask him out, and she‚Äôs a huge part of why. On the one hand, they never actually dated, the closest they got to that was a year and a half ago, and unless she‚Äôs flat-out lying, she‚Äôs not into him that way now.

I‚Äôm a guy in my early-mid 20s who feels so far behind the eight ball at this stage when it comes to sex and relationships in general. While it seems like everyone I know lost their virginity in their early teens, and have since learned and experienced through various partners, I have never had a single sexual partner or any sort of sexual contact with anyone else. 

It‚Äôs not for a lack of trying ‚Äì the only proper girlfriend I‚Äôve ever had (six years ago, maybe more at this stage since I stopped counting some time ago) was too scared to ever try anything, and I‚Äôve been on my fair share of dates but nothing has ever led anywhere. 

After being ghosted by a girl after a number of dates and us discussing getting serious with things about two years ago, my already fragile self-esteem had taken enough of a beating and I just stopped trying really after that point, especially with graduating and working taking primary focus around the same time. 

Right now, I feel like I‚Äôm at a point where I can‚Äôt see anything ever happening. Obviously, it would be stupid and na√Øve to write it off completely, but I‚Äôve reached a stage where I‚Äôm just not sure how something would and feel like I‚Äôd probably stuff it up due to my inexperience. 

People know me as being incredibly charismatic and easy to talk to and get along with. I have a lot of confidence in my personality, but the same can‚Äôt be said for my looks. I put a lot of effort into trying to look as good as I can, but I‚Äôve never received what I‚Äôd consider to be a genuine compliment regarding my looks ‚Äì unless you count most of my friends‚Äô mothers, weirdly. I should note I‚Äôve lost a considerable amount of weight recently (put some of what I‚Äôd lost the first time around back on after that whole giving up on dating thing) and get the odd positive comment about that, but I still struggle to get past my visually-related insecurities stemming back years, even if I look much different now to how I did as a kid. 

Alright, sob-story out of the way, where I‚Äôm at now is at a stage where I feel like I want to start trying again because I‚Äôm scared nothing will ever happen if I don‚Äôt act fast enough. Every single one of my good friends I can think of bar two are in long-term relationships (and those two both regularly manage to hook up with others a lot) with some now married and others engaged, meaning I struggle to get out and meet anyone through them anymore. With my tertiary studies over and me working remotely and in a very male-dominated area, there‚Äôs little chance to meet anyone there either.

And given my phrasing of it in such a way as ‚Äòmeeting someone‚Äô, I think it‚Äôs fairly clear that some random hook-up isn‚Äôt exactly what I‚Äôm after. You may mock, and a lot of you probably will, but I‚Äôd always wanted my first time to actually mean something I guess, as I‚Äôve found that I personally need to have an emotional connection with someone to feel a proper physical attraction for them (ie. more than simply finding someone ‚Äòhot‚Äô).

Besides, I feel like the sort of person who would only be after a hook-up wouldn‚Äôt want someone with *literally no experience* who is almost certainly going to be a terrible root as such. I feel given my situation of being totally sexually inexperienced at what feels to be this late in the game, someone who would be understanding of that situation is almost certainly required. 

But given it seems like all the good ones are gone or however you want to phrase it, I‚Äôm just not sure where to find people like that. I‚Äôm not sure Tinder (which I‚Äôve admittedly never tried) is the place, especially since I feel that given my self-esteem issues surrounding my *totally fine to everyone else* but *ugly to me* looks an app where I‚Äôm judged off my appearance isn‚Äôt exactly for me, plus it seems like most people on there are mainly after hook-ups, which, as noted, they probably wouldn‚Äôt want someone like me in that case. 

I don‚Äôt drink so going to bars isn‚Äôt really an option, and given a lack of good ones where I am they wouldn‚Äôt be even if I did. Aside from some chance meeting that would only ever happen in a TV show or movie, I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. 

And even if the time comes, I‚Äôm worried that the fact I have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm doing in the sack might ruin my chances if the person is not understanding of that. My closest friend, a girl who is the only person I feel I can really confide in about any of this, reckons I don‚Äôt really need to mention this to a prospective partner, but I‚Äôd personally feel like I‚Äôd conned them if I didn‚Äôt since I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd figure it out soon enough. 

So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm not sure how to meet people given my situation, and if I did actually meet someone who wanted to do the do with me, I wouldn‚Äôt bloody know how. Any advice you have will definitely be appreciated and taken on board since I think it‚Äôs fairly clear that I need some. And even if not, thanks for reading my ramblings anyways.

After the many years apart, and spending a lot of time with them recently, i cant help but feel like they‚Äôve changed and really seen the error of their previous ways, and they apologize profusely for how bad things were before and promise a future of love and happiness together. I love them so much it pains me, but im petrified that things will just go right back to the way they were before. 
Even scarier, the thought of being happy for a couple of years, getting married and starting a family, only to have it crumble when i cant afford to start anew. 
So, the begging question, how do you know if someones truly changed? How can you tell if their seemingly sincere remorse is legitimate? I am a paranoid person due to terrible relationships, and im at a point in my life where i need to choose a path to take. I just dont want to fuck up, i just want to be happy",dating_advice

t3_dlnqt9,Want to make sure girl knows how I feel before she fully commits to other relationship,"I (24M) really like another girl (25F). I‚Äôm the coach of the team that she is the captain of. We have to work closely together to ensure team is organised etc.. Through that, we have developed a good relationship, the conversation now moves freely from business to personal and the odd bit of flirting. 

The problem - she has recently started seeing this guy (same age as her I think). I have heard through the grapevine that they‚Äôve been on 3 dates. She has told other girls in the group that it‚Äôs going ‚Äúreally well‚Äù so far. In my (private) conversations with her, she has instead referred to the situation as ‚Äúok‚Äù and ‚Äúalright‚Äù.

I really want her to know how I feel about her, before she takes it any further with this guy.

t3_dlkbto,Dealing with bland profiles,"I (27M) just started trying OLD again, I signed up for bumble. I had been off for a few months, but something I noticed when getting back on is the large number of profiles that are extemely bland.

There are a couple profiles that are a definite ""Yes"" that actually have some information about them, that I find attractive (nerdy and active) and a similar amount of definite ""No""s (overly religious).

However, a vast majority of profiles I see are just picture of them, with a couple of words tops in the bio. I'm not the kind of person to just swipe on looks alone, so it feels weird for me to give 90% of the bumble population a blanket right or left swipe.

How has it become so normal for women's profiles to be so uninteresting? I can't imagine that most of them are getting success out of this. I recognize that some people do this for Instagram followers, but that's not everyone, but it just seems like a waist of time for everyone involved.",dating_advice
t3_dlnnh1,She wants to take things slow. Confused!,"Backstory:

I met this girl on tinder about a month ago, the weird thing is we have lots of mutual friends and one of them actual tried to hook us up before we even met as she thought we would be a good match. So, we met up and had a great first few dates. We were texting every day and it seemed really promising. The third date we were literally all over each other, there was so much sexual tension so we agreed to meet up the following weekend where we got absolutely wasted and had sex. Afterwards while still plastered she opened up to me and admitted we kinda rushed into it and should of waited but she also said she wasn't going anywhere and she wanted us to fall in love and some of the usual drunk talk but still, very promising. The next morning she said she felt bad because that was probably the alcohol talking and wasn't sure that's what she meant. We still spent the rest of the weekend together and had a nice time, still kissing, cuddling and fooling around. I was sure she was into me as all the signs were there. We were even beginning to arrange plans/trips for the near future. Then came Monday and while still texting she told me she wanted to chill a bit, take things slowly and not rush into anything serious. We continued to text each other and the nature of the messges was just as it was before (flirty etc) I'm just confused as to what she meant by this. Things did seem to be moving at a very fast pace which was fine by me but I'm not sure what to do next or if I was coming on too strong. Should I give her some space? Or continue as we were? Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Just for reference we are both in our early 30s and she has had some really bad experiences with men.",dating_advice
t3_dlk8p9,LDR worthy?,"
I (25F) moved to a bigger city after finishing graduate school, and secured a job in my field right away about 1 year ago. However, I didn't realize how lucky I got, and that in this particular city, the jobs in my field do not have much room for upward growth. So, about 2 weeks ago, I started applying to jobs out of state with great opportunities, better salaries/benefits, and clear paths for upward growth.

Just over a month ago, I started seeing C (28M), and connected immediately, and the feelings have been intense and mutual. He's been so incredibly supportive with me taking an opportunity about 6 hours away and has truly encouraged me to do what's best for me. However, everything with the job and move is happening quick, I have about 2 more weeks together in the same city. He's the total package, and I feel like so much of our lives were so fate driven that we just happened to cross paths. It seems like he feels the same about me, and has expressed similar sentiments. With such a short time though, am I taking it to be more than it truly is?

He's expressed liking the city that I'm moving to, but hasn't said anything other than that. Knowing that I'm leaving, and there are a lot of feelings, and knowing that if I continued living here, we'd be seeing each other, what do I do? Is it best to just break it off early?

t3_dln77f,Dating While Separated? Yay or Nay?,"I'm sure this has been discussed here about a million times, but am curious. 

My situation is pretty straightforward. Married for three years with no kids, no house, no debt, etc. I moved out in April and have been very much living on my own as a single person since then. We don't speak unless it has to do with the divorce and there is no drama between us (a little animosity, but I expected that since I was the one who left him). We've filed, but nothing has been finalized yet because everything is a waiting game with the court system. 

I've been dating again for about two months. Before anyone judges me, my relationship was very over before I got the courage to leave. I'm still young, but not that young, and don't feel like I should have to put my life on hold when I am really ready, emotionally and mentally, to date again. 

I'm on two dating apps and used to put it right in the bio but that got me some real weirdos, for whatever reason. So since then I have been out with maybe five guys. I was upfront with all of them on or before the first date, and shockingly, none of them cared. 

However. Just had a guy totally freak out on me on an app about it. And I can see his side...it seems sketch, and a little weird. But I really am a completely normal person, and my marriage didn't work out for valid reasons. Like all I can say is that we are very broken up, it's just unfortunately that our break-up requires a lot of paperwork. 

It made me wonder if I should just put it right back in my bio again, to avoid anyone feeling like I'm hiding something. Or if I'm okay doing what I've been doing, and bringing it up on a first date.

All in all, I was surprised by how much we had in common... and then I looked back at the conversation and realized that he might be hinting that he‚Äôs into me. He never mentioned any girl in particular during our conversation, and the whole thing about wanting to meet someone organically lines up nicely with the fact that we already know each other reasonably well.

t3_dlmuo8,Bi-Polar Boyfriend is Giving Me the Silent Treatment,"  

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a few months and we committed pretty quickly. He was always very consistent and proactive with our relationship. I‚Äôve met his whole family a few times, and he‚Äôs been a constant fixture in my life. All was well until a week ago. He is bi-polar and I think he has taken a downswing mood-wise. Suddenly he was distant, not reaching out to me or following up when he said he‚Äôd call. So I gently brought it up to him, asked if he was ok, did he want to talk and he brought me a flower and apologized and just said he was really stressed and running on no sleep. So I left it at that. Then a few days later we were meeting for a movie. He gave me a meeting time but when I got there I texted him and he said ‚Äúsorry, forgot, running 20 min late.‚Äù So I was bothered by that as he‚Äôs been punctual every time and if it was reversed he‚Äôd be furious. It felt like he wasn‚Äôt putting effort into the date anymore, like I was an afterthought. During the movie I diplomatically mentioned I felt something was still up, that he wasn‚Äôt putting in the usual effort. He got really mad at me. Like ‚Äúhow could you ever say that to me, I had a terrible week, I‚Äôm tired, and x/y/z excuse. You can never speak to me like that.‚Äù I apologized profusely, even though I‚Äôm not really sure I did anything wrong. I‚Äôve never seen him that angry. He stayed the night but left the next morning in a huff saying he needed to recharge and was still angry about what I said. I texted him after he left, saying I‚Äôm sorry and I care about him. No response. He gave the silent treatment all weekend, which he‚Äôs never done. I was so upset. By weekend end I was mostly angry because it felt cruel and unfair. And again, I don‚Äôt think I did anything that would make his behavior acceptable. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do now. He‚Äôs still ignoring me other than responding to my text saying we needed to talk with ‚Äúsounds good to me!‚Äù That also made me feel sick to my stomach, as if he was being smarmy or as if he didn‚Äôt care.

Am I going crazy here or is this guy acting nuts? I don‚Äôt think I did anything that would warrant this reaction, and I think this is about his own guilt or wanting to push someone away who was trying to get close. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I feel torn up about it. Thoughts??",dating_advice

t3_dlg9em,Clueless about the possibility of getting back together,"I posted this in the BreakUp community, but got no response.

This is going to be a long post. I'm a 23 year old girl who is experiencing her first breakup. The breakup happened on September 26th, 2 days before my birthday. 

The relationship lasted for almost 4 years. We met in first year in college, when I was 19 and he was 18. We are studying physics and the flirting started when we were discussing about solving problems and the material in general. We're from different cities, but it wasn't really a problem for us since we were seeing each other every day in classes, and after them. We survived the summers without seeing much of each other because we weren't really able to make the commute, but again, it wasn't a big problem. In the beginning of the relationship I told him that I have 2 deal breakers - the first one was no sex until I have only a few exams until graduation, and the second one was cheating. I also told him that if he doesn't agree not to do these things, that we shouldn't even start a relationship since it will be a lot harder to break it once emotions are present. He said that he doesn't mind these ""conditions"", so we started to build a relationship.

Since I'm from Europe, in our second year, I spent the summer in the US, on work and travel program. My ex didn't come with me even though I asked him to. When he finally decided to pick up the phone, he missed the deadline for applying by a few days. So I went alone. I wrote a journal for him about what was happening with me for the whole summer, and then 3 more months when I got home because I wanted to finish the whole notebook, cover to cover, and I gave him that for our anniversary. Since we didn't see each other for 3 months that summer, I somehow ended up breaking my word in a sense, and from then we started to have oral sex. Fast forward to the next year, I got genital herpes from him and I survived the biggest physical and emotional pain in my life in that period. I thought about breaking up with him, but my motto in life is you don't give up on the people you love, you give your best to make it work. And I did that. 

Everything was fine, or so I thought, until this summer. My ex went to a conference in a different country, with students from our college. I didn't because I couldn't afford it. I was bothered by my ex not asking me whether he should go. I've never stopped him from anything he wanted to do or say. I was never jealous. Anyways, the internet reception was very bad, and since he was on the conference, we couldn't really get in touch. One day we had a small argument. On that day he made out with one of the younger students from our college, after having a few beers, apparently. He told me this a day after he got back. He wanted for us to split right away, but after a lot of crying from the both of us, and a lot of begging from my side, he agreed to think about it. He said he'd need a month to think about it, but that was too much for me, and I didn't want to ruin my birthday which is in the end of September, so we agreed that we'll talk about after 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks I never said anything about our relationship and where we're headed.

Before we met after the 2 weeks we agreed on, he broke up with me on the phone (we were in different cities) for the first time. 5 hours after that call, he called me again and asked me to get together, which we did. When we met in person, we talked about everything, but the biggest problem was our future. We always wanted to apply for scholarships and to go to a different country on postgraduate studies. I asked him if he'd do that I wasn't able to go with him because he's a better student than I am and there is a real possibility for him to be accepted, but not me. His definitive answer was 80% he won't do it without me. But after the cheating, I cannot agree on us living in different countries, and I told him that.

In the next 2 weeks, from September 15th, the more we talked, the more I had a feeling that we would fall apart. The last straw was arguing about my birthday. I told him repeatedly that I need him by my side on my birthday party, and he didn't want to come. He said he didn't want to act like everything is alright when it isn't. But I didn't see it that way and I still don't. We had that fight for a few days and it really hurt me. We broke up 2 days before my birthday. Since this is my first relationship, and I'm an introvert, I asked him to come to my house on my birthday so I could have a last kiss and some hugs. And he came.

We decided to try and stay friends because we're colleagues and can't really avoid each other in college. But also because we care very much for each other, or so I want to think. After we broke up we talked about what happened, but I'm still confused. He insists that we want different things - his priority in life is career, and mine is family, but I honestly don't think that we couldn't make the relationship work because of that. He keeps telling me that I did nothing wrong, and that I'm a very good person with a lot of qualities, and yet he left me. I can't make sense of it. At first I cried a lot, then I was numb for weeks, and now I'm very emotional. This Saturday we're supposed to meet because he has to give me back the books I borrowed him. When we were chatting today, I was telling him how I really am and he asked me if I still have feelings for him. I replied with, I'm not crying these days without a reason. And then he asked me if I wanted to talk about us on Saturday.

I have no idea what to expect. I invested everything I had in this relationship. I was blindsided by its ending. In the beginning I said that cheating is a deal breaker for me. After the breakup, I kinda understand him because other things came to surface, which I couldn't believe. It turned out that my ex kept quiet about all the little things that bothered him, even though I always insisted that we should be open and honest about everything, so we can solve problems immediately and not have them again. He kept quiet until he snapped and cheated. 

This is the biggest psychological trauma I've ever experienced. And I've been depressed long before the breakup. And now I have no idea what to do. We had a lot of beautiful moments together. I thought he was the one, until he gave up on us. Now he wants to talk about us, and I don't know what to do. I still love him, and I think he still loves me, but sometimes love isn't enough. I have no idea what to say if he wants us to get back together. I'm clueless and my whole life is on hold because of this...

t3_dllu0g,I'm starting to get scared of my crush,"I (F17) recently have a crush called Peter (M17) who is in the same class as me. In the beginning we did long stares but I didn't think much of it. Then one time we were walking the same way to the train station so we had a conversation. He told me that he likes the way I think. He even acted like a gentleman and opened doors for me and even suggested to go a route where you go through a building, so I won't be cold.

Few days later I started to act coldly towards him, because I noticed that he gets along with my friend Ashley pretty well to the point that I thought he had a crush on her. Since it seemed my friend also has a crush on him, I hoped they will get together. So whenever I would talk to my crush I would talk something good about Ashley.

Later Ashley, me and few others went to Peter's place for a school project. A friend of his had to leave early, so we all decided that we leave too. But I jokingly said that I still have time and that I could stay a little bit longer. Peter probably didn't want this because he responded with an obvious excuse to make us leave. I felt rejected and thought I should finally forget him and move on. But when I got home, I got a message by him which led us to play an online game together the whole evening.

There was an upcoming event. I already planned to go with a friend to that event. I then casually asked Peter if he's going there too. He said no but suggested that we two could go together and that it would seem like a date. When he said date, he leaned in to me and kinda whispered 'loudly'. I responded with a confused expression while Ashley who was standing next to us kinda freaked out. He then said, that he just wanted to see Ashley's reaction. After that we three went to the train station together. Ashley left and Peter suddenly asked me when we're gonna meet up for the event, even though I told him that I'm already going there with another person. I said to him that he could go with Ashley since she also wants to go. He didn't respond to that.

I ended up going with him to the event anyway. He then mentioned that a friend of his actually asked him if he wanted to go there before me but he chose to go with me. The whole day felt like a lovey dovey date because for example he told me to hold onto his jacket so we don't get seperated because there were so many people. He casually would compliment/flirt with me and react cute when I compliment him. Sometimes he would even pull my sleeves when walking or when I wouldn't eat he tried to feed me with his food. He also often asked me if I want him to carry me so I can see more, but I declined. He also said that we should meet up more and planned that I go to his place next week to play games together. He also mentioned that his parents wouldn't be at home.

On the next day in class, he suddenly got very flirty with Ashley, even in front of me. He even carried her when she let him. Later Ashley told me that Peter was staring at her a lot since she was wearing a tight top. I was so confused. Suddenly his attention was nowhere to be found. When he talked to her it seemed like I wouldn't exist. But then in the next moment, he would talk to me again.

This all make me think that he might be playing games with me and it makes me scared of him because I don't know what's going on in his mind. His flirts seem too natural and perfect. It made me search the traits of a player and almost everything fit to him. But at the same time we're not a couple or anything like that so I'm not in the position to think that I'm special. He's pretty talkative and extrovert so maybe that's just him being genuine. Still, all these weird actions done by him give me a weird feeling which make me be scared of him. I still like to believe that I'm just thinking too much.

Is it normal that I'm starting to get scared of my crush after he's been showing weird signs or is he actually acting fine and I should stop worrying? What are his intentions?",dating_advice

t3_dlfzvz,How do I move on from liking someone I meet and hangout with almost every day of the week?,"So I'm 18. Freshman college boy. Fell for someone who I grew super close to over my time here in college. I know I'm stupid for falling for someone so quickly, but that's just how I am. This is the second girl I've ever truly fallen for. And I hate the fact that I can't move on. Or at least, I hate the fact that my feelings for her at this point are detrimental to my emotional well-being and are impacting my studies negatively. 

How do I get rid of my feelings for her? Or at least, what can I do to try and have it affect me less?

Edit: she's also 18

Edit 2: here's some extra context. I've already asked her out a bunch of times and she was down all the time but I never specified them as dates. When I confessed, she told me she wasn't looking for a relationship yet. We're both still straight and single and religion isn't a problem for us. We're really close friends and it's not like anything is awkward between us.

I tried to compare my current situation with the last girl I fell for. With the last girl, when she rejected me, we still hung out together a lot the same way I still hang out with this current girl a lot. But I don't know why my feelings for the last girl didn't bother me in the slightest.

I concluded that maybe it has something to do with what the said when they rejected me. The last girl told me that she just doesn't see me that why while this current girl said she isn't looking for a relationship yet. I guess my brain took that reason and went ""maybe there's still a slight chance,"" and so that's why I can't really move on? I don't even know anymore.

She did invite me to join them at one point and, while I don't think they dislike me, I don't believe I made a great impression because I was running on low sleep and I got so tired that I even stopped taking after a point which made things a little awkward (for some reason, I was more focused on the fact that I wore the wrong socks than on what was actually happening around me)- I realise I probably should have left before this and I clearly wasn't thinking straight. Ever since, we've only kind of smiled at each other and made some uncommitting eye contact. 

As for her friends - they haven't made much contact with me since. I think I have enough confidence to approach her/them, but I keep getting the feeling that I'll come across as intrusive.

t3_dlkzw2,Interested in a damaged woman,"I've met a woman that I have strong feelings for, and in some ways it has been reciprocated.  We text all day, we've made out a bunch, slept together, she sends me nudes, and she says I'm ""very attractive and interesting"".  But she is also super messed up.  She self harms, has been sexually assaulted, and suffers from cptsd.  She's prone to periods of depression where she doesn't want to see me.  She doesn't want a boyfriend, because she gets claustrophobic.  She doesn't like it when I say sweet things to her and thinks its cheesy.  Her capacity for romance is so diminished by past trauma that she can only see things through the eyes of a cynic.  Sex is just sex. She's given up on love.  It's all very transactional.  


Gaining her trust has been very difficult.  I'm navigating blind here because she doesn't communicate her feelings very well.

t3_dlkqob,Is she (22f) playing games with me (23m?) or am I just being jealous and over thinking?,"So I recently met a girl at a party. She was really into me and initiated it first. We got along really well, and me who has hardly any experience with girls, was too scared to make a move. So at the end of the day I shook her hand told her it was great meeting her. However, she gave me her phone number and said we should hang out sometime, she told me how much fun she had that day.


So a week later we went on a date, we went to the beach, go kart and watched a movie. We had a lot of fun and we kissed at the end of the day. She told me she had a great time and she can‚Äôt wait to see me again. We took a picture at a photo booth. I posted it on social media and she told me it was really cute and she really enjoyed herself.


So I thought it was going good. It seemed like the start of a relationship. She told me she really wants to see me again, called me handsome and charming, all these compliments etc. I felt really happy for a bit.


(Quick background info) As long as I‚Äôve known her, she‚Äôs always been a bad texter. Always replying hours later, the next day, or not at all. I don‚Äôt have a problem with this. It just makes me sad, but I understand she can‚Äôt always be on her phone, and she‚Äôs busy with work. She apologized for being a bad texter and I told her it was okay, that we‚Äôre both adults and I understand that she‚Äôs got important things to take her of. So then she told me thank you for being patient and understanding with me. The texting thing doesn‚Äôt bother me too much but I mention it because it leads to my next part.


Often, during these texting sessions where she doesn‚Äôt reply for hours, Instagram shows me that she‚Äôs active online. Posting/liking stuff. So she‚Äôll be on her phone but not replying to me at all, which makes me feel like she doesn‚Äôt really want to talk to me. The way I see it, if she really did have interest in me, wouldn‚Äôt she be wanting to talk to me as much as she can and not responding whenever she feels like it? I‚Äôm very self-critical and start thinking negatively things like ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs just leading you on‚Äù.


Anyways, she told me she was going to a concert a few weeks ago. On Sunday I asked her what day is she going, I told her I‚Äôd like to go out again but I wanted to know what day the concert was so I don‚Äôt plan anything on that day. Turns out it‚Äôs on the day I had in mind. It‚Äôs fine, she‚Äôs seeing her favorite band so we could go another time. She told me she wants to hang out again and that she misses me.

Anyways, while we‚Äôre texting, I went on Instagram and saw she just posted a photo with some guy, out on the town at a table having lunch. Then my jealous self starts wondering who this guy is, why are they together? It‚Äôs not her brother, so who is he, just a friend? Then later that day, they went to a pumpkin patch and she posted a photo of her time at the pumpkin patch. 


So now I‚Äôm thinking, aren‚Äôt pumpkin patches just for couples going on dates to take cute pictures? Who goes to hang out at a pumpkin patch with a friend? I wouldn‚Äôt. Second, she posted a photo of this little date, but she didn‚Äôt post anything from the time we went out (I know I‚Äôm coming off jealous, but how should I react to that?). I give her space because my sister dates a controlling freak and I never want to be like that to a girl.


Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it, just being a jealous guy cause she‚Äôs out at a pumpkin patch with some guy, but what else am I supposed to think. I know we weren‚Äôt officially in a relationship, but it seemed like we were doing really good.

We dated for 3 months on the program and then when it was over we decided to do long distance having a goal in mind of her coming to visit me in my home country at the end of the year.

I pretty much always buy a snack from her (reaping that sweet 50% off employee discount) towards the end of the day and we chat for a while. 

I know she's just being friendly as part of her job, but she always asks me questions first (stuff like ""so you had a busy day huh? how was your week? any plans for next week?"" etc.) and pretty much one-sidedly keeps the conversation going (whereas I don't really see her chatting to anyone else, but I suppose we have a friendly rapport).

t3_dlj895,In the process of getting ghosted the second time by the same person and I feel like exploding,"So after some rough introduction to online dating life, I (27m) finally ""got the hang of it"" and got some nice dates, including one that felt like a 10/10 match(\~21f, not sure anymore to be honest). I may be exaggerating, but the date had everything. Deep talk, connections on pretty much every niche and weird nerd hobby we had, we went to multiple locations since no one seemed to want the date to end plus a bit of cuddling and holding hands.. sadly no kissing on the first date since I just pussed out, but no biggie.

After this first date she told me immediately that she will be out of town visiting family for 3 weeks and sadly won't be available for dates during that time. That was also when she stopped answering my messages. I thought that was the classic ghost. I mean, who does that? Even if she is out of town, who can't even send one message in 3 weeks? So I just moved on with my life (after - of course - venting my frustration in this subreddit...)

What do you know, after pretty much exactly 3 weeks she actually sends me a message if I want to meet. After 3 weeks of nothing I was a little irked, but eh, why not give it another shot? I really liked her after all, so I gave her the benefit of a doubt.

We went to see an amazing movie and continued where we left off. Except we started making out heavily in between the deep talk. Again, moving to pub after pub, no one wanting the date to end and at the end we even walked the entire way home just to spend more time together. And you know what? This time she sent me messages like her life depended on it after the date. Kiss emojis and ""where are we going next time"" kind of messages. So we met yet again, and it went similarly great, we stood in the rain for an hour and did nothing but kissing and laughing like in a bad romcom and I was over the moon. Same messaging energy afterwards, + she mentioned that I should definitely come meet her roommates and stuff like that. So, I deleted all dating apps again and was ready to update my venting post from earlier with a huge ""THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS""- post and all that. (I know. I know.)

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, so I think she is about to ghost me again. I asked her when we should meet next and all of a sudden, ""come meet my roommates"" became ""I can't make it this week, I'm pretty busy"" with no further suggestions. So I asked her what's up and she said ""nothing, just busy."" and she hasn't answered me since then. This was two days ago. For context, her response time while we were meeting was like 20 minutes tops.

&amp;#x200B;

And, I. Am. Furious. I didn't mention anything of it, but I can't help it. How can we go from a week of chatting every waking minute + having amazing dates, Saturday standing in the rain kissing to sunday ""yeah, we won't meet and I won't tell you why"". Even if she DOES answer back after a while, how should I react? how is such a behaviour ok? If there is someone else, why did SHE message me back and arranged for the dates and stuff just to drop me a week later? Heck, I would even be ok if there was someone else, we haven't even talked about what's going on between us, how could I fault her for anything, but getting absolutely zero information after all that is such a bad feeling I can't even describe it. Just being nobody to her all of a sudden and not worthy of any explanations in the matter of hours.

t3_dlduza,Should I text her ?,"Hi folks.

I was about to give up on online dating after many unsuccessful result on Tinder/Bumble/OKcupid when I received 2 notifications on Facebook dating.

One of them was a girl that I was attracted on Tinder but we never matched... Well I send a like to her profile too and we started to talk.

At the beginning it was cold, She never answered to my introduction but 2 days later I tried again to start the talk... Still cold as ice, short messages from her. I was about to gave up but I had the feeling that that girl might be a nice person so I pushed more and she started to talk and introduced her to me, it was cool we talked for a few days in a row. I found out that we have got a lot of common points, it was very cool. She told me that she will be on vacation for one week but I asked her if she would be okay to go on date when she comes back from her holiday, she said yes.

Now it's been 5 days she came back from her vacation and today she changed her profile picture from our conversation but no word from her.

I'm coming to you to know if I should go to her and ask her how was her vacation then ask for the date or wait a little bit more before starting a new conversation with her. I don't want to seems like the guy who were waiting for her because he is desperate you know :D... It's the first time I'm asking for advice online but I feel a bit lost with those new way of dating people, I always meet people in person that's why I don't know how to act online.

I think about him more often than usual, I get kinda exited/happy when he texts me, I often find myself glancing at him in the classroom and some times I even think about wanting him to look at me and I'd catch him staring.

Maybe some of you think I'm an idiot for not knowing if this is just normal friendship or if I have a crush on him, but I've just never felt love in a romantic way before so I'm new to this.

t3_dli7uj,does having space to figure out what you want really work?,"Currently in a situation where we both got super overwhelmed with how things were progressing but I‚Äôm okay with being overwhelmed because it means I felt something real this time. However, I (f18) also agreed with him (m20) that it would be a good idea to have some space to think about our lives and stuff. He told me he doesn‚Äôt want me to wait around for him but that he doesn‚Äôt know if space will change anything. He had doubt halfway through dating for a month and i wasn‚Äôt worried about it because I had a little bit of doubt at the beginning too. And since we just started getting to know each other/dating I wasnt trying to rush things. And my family said to me that if you didn‚Äôt have any doubt then your feelings wouldn‚Äôt be real because when you truly like someone a lot, of course you‚Äôre going to be doubtful from insecurities and you tend to become more insecure about yourself when you start to really like someone. And it made sense. I just hope that he realizes how much he‚Äôs lost sooner rather than later because he‚Äôs always told me how much of a great person I am and I think that scares him, or makes him feel like he‚Äôs not good enough for me even though I‚Äôve told him multiple times that he‚Äôs more than enough for me and that I‚Äôm not some perfect person either.

t3_dli2du,Am I doing something wrong? For those who started dating in late 20‚Äôs,"Idk is this is allowed but I‚Äôm posting again because I want more people to see this and give me their opinions, thoughts and advice.

Sorry in advance if this is long and messy. 

So I am in my late  20‚Äôs (f), and while I don‚Äôt believe that I am too old to never have dated anyone, when comparing to the group of people I grew up back in my hometown, I am the only one who has never dated. I have never kissed anyone. Have never been sexually active. Most of these people are either married or already starting a family. I don‚Äôt live in that town anymore but often times hear about them and how someone else just got married or how someone else is having a child. 

I am bi, so finding people attractive and being attracted to the has never been the problem. I truly don‚Äôt know why it is that I have never really been approached by someone who was interested in me. Although this isn‚Äôt entirely true, when I finally understood and acknowledged that I was bi, there was someone I started talking to but because I was living what I felt was a monumental time in my life, I wasn‚Äôt looking to date anyone then, I felt like it was a time for me to just fully, truly, and deeply be me. Plus, we were living far away from each other and I never saw them with intentions of dating, we were just friends but they developed feelings for me and I didn‚Äôt. Previous to that I had one major crush on someone I meet in college and almost made a move on them because they had been the first person I was starting to have feelings for, but I never made a move. This person was someone I truly wanted to date, even after much time had passed I would think about them and feel such regret that I didn‚Äôt asked them out. I did eventually stopped thinking about them. A couple of years ago, I meet someone else. I felt right away that I wasn‚Äôt going to like this person but boy was I in for a surprise. I‚Äôve always known what I want in life and from someone else, I‚Äôve always known what I want in a partner, and this person had it all, checked all the boxes. Except they were in a relationship. So you know I liked them but because they were dating someone else nothing really happened, I never said anything to them about my crush. However they tried to use me as a rebound and even if I really liked them that was something I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with, I just felt that if they liked me then they needed time to process their breakup and then we would talk if they so desired. But of course that never happened because they were just looking for a rebound.  

So I guess my question is, if you have been in a similar situation, what did you do to start dating? I feel like this is the step I‚Äôm stuck in. I don‚Äôt have low self-esteem, I do however am some who doesn‚Äôt do well in crowds so I‚Äôm usually uncomfortable there. I don‚Äôt really like to go out dancing or to bars because I‚Äôm just not cool with people just getting into my space simply because I‚Äôm out there dancing. I don‚Äôt do bars because I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt have many friends and I truly don‚Äôt know why this is. I never have people approach me, it sometimes feels like people don‚Äôt even notice me. I feel like I have so much love to give and so many things I want to experience with a partner yet it seems like no one wants that with me. I have never felt upset about it until recently, I see so many different couples, all kinds of couples so I just don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt have that as well?  

Anyway have any thoughts, advice or just anything to say about this?",dating_advice
t3_dlhxvz,Am I being played?,"Hey all, I‚Äôm new to reddit &amp; this is my first time posting.

I (25f) started talking to this guy (29m) thru a dating app about two months ago. Obviously when we first got to talking it would be all day long, quick responses, etc. Then I noticed he started replying much later and with responses like ‚Äúlmao‚Äù. Since we started talking, we‚Äôve been on a few ‚Äúdates‚Äù. We‚Äôve slept together almost every time and the sex is great. But I realized that he doesn‚Äôt ask me any questions about my past, my day, and just doesn‚Äôt seem interested in my life in general. He doesn‚Äôt like to share much about his past either, he gives vague answers or dodges questions altogether. I‚Äôm always the one to ask about the next date and make plans. He never says he misses me unless I say it first and ‚Äúmisses‚Äù my calls. I‚Äôve confronted him about these things because we‚Äôve both admitted we like each other and he says it‚Äôs because of how much he hates his current job and being tight on money makes him feel bad we can‚Äôt do much when we see each other (even tho he buys designer items). I knew money was a problem for him (&amp; I‚Äôm not balling either so no judgement) so most of our dates would be me going over to his place. And I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôd rather hangout in his room than not at all and he shouldn‚Äôt feel bad. But nothing has changed.

Am I being incredibly naive and delusional? Is it super obvious that this guy is just using me for sex and telling me he likes me just to keep me around? I want to believe it‚Äôs just difficult for him to open up but I honestly feel like this is just a physical thing at this point.",dating_advice

t3_dlhfhz,Casually dating ex that dates her ex..,"Long story but I'll try to keep it short. About 4 years ago I was engaged to the love of my life with a baby on the way. She ended up leaving bc I had a drinking problem but have since gotten it under control, 3 years sober. In that time she got into a serious relationship for about a year and half. The guy was in my daughter's life and seemed okay but broke it off bc he decide he'd rather not have kids or be a stepdad. For the last year they have been friends with benefits pretty much. Once she starts dating he comes crawling back and she drops whoever for him. Now to me, we eventually started taking family trips and for the past 3 months have been hooking up. She texts me everyday, is affectionate, etc. Until he comes around then I get ghosted. We're both single and she says she needs to work on herself and she needs time to get to know me again. She gets mad if I ask about him. Sometimes she'll say they hang and others she won't. She goes back and forth on what she says. I really care about her and the trips made me realize what I'm missing with a family that's together. Ive always been involved in my daughter's life, every weekend and some weekdays but doing things together with the kids brings me so much happiness. As well as the alone time with her, I cherish it. But how is it so easy to spend the entire weekend with me then have him over and sleep with him? I need an outside perspective. Do I stand a chance? She claims she doesn't want him but I'm the first one dropped when he comes around. My head is spinning. What are your opinions about this and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",dating_advice

I‚Äôm sure this comes off as though I‚Äôm just being petty, but I really mean it. 99.99999% of people will understand if you simply say ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not interested in you.‚Äù

I see people constantly trying to break down these tiny messages people hide in their conversations, and I know from experience that it just eats you up inside.

She is a girl(19) in my friends group and i like her. It‚Äòs not like im in love with her but i find her really interesting as a person and i love to talk to her. We‚Äòve been friends for 2 or 3 months and text each other every few days. Everytime I text her she seems like she is very uninterested but everytime she writes me first she is very enthusiastic.

He asked me if I‚Äôd like to go out last night, and I said sure, how‚Äôs 7? I had to run an errand before hand and told him I would send him a text when I was on my way.

I got there on time and he wasn‚Äôt there so I waited about 10mins before sending a text letting him know I was there, another 20mins go by and I was starting to get cold so I went to a local coffee shop and waited another 10mins or so before he told me he was just leaving a friends and still needed to go home to get cleaned up and ready, so I asked him how long he thought that would be.

This is what lead me to think about this question ‚Äî I‚Äôm 2.5 years clean, and really do not struggle with any sort of cravings or urges to relapse.

t3_dlgst5,Would it be appropriate if I (17F) started seeing my former crush's brother (19M)?,"For context: I've had a bit of history with my former crush, let's call him X. We were pretty close, and a few years ago, I developed a crush on him, but I don't think of it as anything seriously since we were young and stupid back then. When he found out though, we did not talk ever again after that (long story short, he kinda hated me). Then one or two years later, he was interested in one of my friends. They started dating and stuff, and I was totally fine with it since I was already over him. I was chill, ya know. But my friend VOLUNTEERINGLY left our group so she could hang out with his group (they were cooler, I guess), and so we had a minor conflict. Nothing bad, until she brought up the topic of me liking X, and spoke about some of the bad things he told her about me. I still didn't care, just laughed it off, until X randomly came at me and was like ""why did you kick \[my friend\] out of your group"", and a bigger fight developed from there. All in all, I still think it was just a misunderstanding. I might have despised them in the heat of the moment, but honestly, I don't hate any of them. I don't think they're bad people,  I just believe that in the circumstances, we just weren't able to show the best side of each other.

Anyways, fast forward a couple of years, they're no longer a thing BUT X is interested in ANOTHER one of my friend lmao. Because of this, we all started talking to each other again, it was awkward at first, but I've kinda just put everything behind me, so I gradually became more comfortable. We started hanging out more, including his group in general. However, I don't know if I could say the same for him, because I keep on getting the impression that he is not very fond of me? X has confirmed to me that he has no reason to hate me so he doesn't, but he's not really the kind of person I can easily trust since I'm aware that he does tend to talk crap behind other people's back. Despite that though, he is actually a really generous person, but I'm just unsure if it's sincere or if he's just trying to get on my good side in order to get closer to my friend, right? Am I just being too paranoid?

Getting to the main question now, like I've mentioned, since I've been hanging out with him more, ie. going to his house (because the group occasionally meet up at his house and play games or pool, stuff like that), I've been seeing his brother a lot, and started getting to know him. After our first meeting, I couldn't stop thinking about him lol, so I attempted to talk to him. It didn't go very good, but not bad either (having social anxiety isn't easily lol). But after a few more meet-ups, we got a LOT more comfortable with each other. He would often offer to drive me home, etc. and is just so nice lol I love being with him (I'm trying not to fangirl as I'm typing). BUT it got to a point where X was aware that I was interested in his brother, and he was CLEARLY uncomfortable with it, and I don't blame him? I understand his POV. What made me sorta sad though was that for a few weeks, he completely avoided me, and I felt that by being selfish (liking his brother for my own desire), I was risking my newly restored friendship with X, and also his relationship with my friend (??) -&gt; that's what he said? (they're not official yet but like nearly there) because I was making him uncomfortable so he didn't want to hang near us anymore?

SOoo... I told him I did not like his brother for friendship's sake. But that was before his brother shown any further signs of interest, and ASSUMING he also returns the same feelings for me, do you think it's a good idea for me to have an intimate relationship with X's brother? Or would it be an unhealthy relationship- is there too much at risk?",dating_advice

I relunctly agreed and said Yh sounds fun and left it at that because I thought that‚Äôs her saying no .

I then thought about it despite the obvious signs and said I would be down for a date with u tbh and not ur friend . She then said oh I already asked her so that‚Äôs another sign I guess

I said well let me know when it‚Äôs happening and she ignored the message : 

the thing which confuses me is that this girl  without a shadow or a doubt pops up to me  every single time we then talk for a while and I then wen we are done with the convo I say I‚Äôll message her later if she isn‚Äôt busy Like today we spoke for a bit (whilst she is at work instant replying ) and tells me to drop her a message later when we are done talking

I‚Äôm just curious is she just trying to make a friend now Because she needs a guy to talk to? I definitely need a girl to talk to as well so it works both ways and she has helped as we spoke about both our exes .


It just surprises me that she always pops up to y story on snap and starting conversation with me

t3_dlg7hi,Taking Things Slow?,"I recently went on a date, granted it was a first date, and she wanted to take things slow. I'm 36 (m), she's 35 (F), she's never married, I'm divorced, we both have no kids. We both have stable jobs, life, etc. She says she wants to take things slow before talking about certain things, then says she wants to also take it slow in regards to being intimate, and just slow everywhere. 

I'm not confused at the meaning, but is this new? I'm surprised by this, or is this her way of saying she's not interested? We went to an art museum, and she decided she was done about 2 hours into the visit, and that was that. No hug, no kiss, handshake, nothing, just kind of left it as is. 

I've texted her, called, and got a few replies, nothing too deep. I'm not sweating it too much, but at the same time, I have a tendency to overthink.

t3_dlg0wy,I'm worried that I'm being led on,"Hello,  this is my first post here as I've been seeking advice about my situation. 
I M[26] have been talking to girl[22] for about 5 months now. She lives about an hour and a half from me and we only get to hang out about one weekend day 2-3 days a month. We text daily and call 1-2 times a week. 

The first time we ever hung out we watched movies at my apartment and after she got home that night she told me how much she appreciated me being a gentleman that respected her and  didn't just talk about her body/looks or try to go straight for a home run with her. She also said she really wanted to kiss me but wasn't sure if I'd be okay with it (she is big on consent) which i absolutely respect.  There have been two times since then where I've asked if I could give her a kiss on the cheek to which she happily agreed with.  

She recently felt close enough to me to tell me that earlier this year she was a victim of sexual assualt by a long time close friend. This is something that's put her in a very dark place and she views sex as sacred to her (though she's non-religious). She finds it difficult to trust and get close to anyone now.  

Fast forward to this past weekend (5 months later) when we hang out we will cuddle or hold hands and she laid on a pillow on top of my lap.  She let me feel her back and even play with her butt a little, but that's as far as that went. Both of those were huge steps because she feels uncomfortable about any backside touching since her assault. By the end of it all it was a nice and unfortunately short hangout,  but still no kiss.  I don't want to be rude to say I was expecting one, but it's been 4 months that we've physically seen each other when she mentioned wanting to give me a kiss. She told me that she is starting to really trust me and we have gotten closer with physical touch.


I want to be as respectful as I can be and I hate to sound like a jerk, but it's just felt a little frustrating to be so patient. I really don't want to rush her in healing process. She told me she's a wreck that doesn't expect me to pick up the pieces and she doesn't want to throw all this on me by rushing a relationship.

I get it and I have huge respect for her and I don't want to hurt or use her. 

So my question for advice; does it seem like I'm being led on? Am I still going about this properly? 

Should I bring up our first hangout where she made a comment about a kiss? 

Any advance will be appreciated,  thank you.",dating_advice

t3_dlfni4,5th date with a model she cancellled twice," 

Hi Guys,

So I've been dating a beautiful Brazilian lady who's 22F and I'm 26M.

We had a great first date where we ended up making out all night long. I then traveled for business for a week and she initiated drinks when I got back. Drinks went well with kissing, banter etc. 3rd date I cook for her at my place and we end up having sex, she left her bra at my place on purpose (""I'm going to leave this here). 4th date was supposed to be at her place and she cancels, so I asked her when she was free next and ended up at her place 4 days later, she cooked me dinner and did a really sexy striptease and then had some of the best sex I ever had. During the 4th date, I proposed to go watch a movie two days later and on the day she cancels due to x. Ok, so I broke my rules (If she cancels the second time she will need to reschedule) and asked if she still wanted to see it to which she replied ""Don't go without me!!! Tomorrow night works for you?"" so I tell her sure and then on the day she cancels 1 hour before the movie and I replied, ""No prob, maybe some other time"". 

What do you guys think? I know flakiness is never a good sign but I'm planning on texting her in 4-5 days if she doesn't establish contact (She's a model but also a masters student, I don't really want to next her without trying my best. I also very stupidly forgot an expensive watch at hers... really dumb I know). Cheers!

TL;DR: Really like a super gorgeous lady. Had sex twice and went on 4 dates, one of which at her place where she cooked for me. She cancels the 5th date twice and not sure how to feel about it.",dating_advice

We communicate clearly on we‚Äôll meet again etc. things have been going well so far except for where we‚Äôre going with this because before him I‚Äôd planned on moving countries, that is still an option except I also kinda want to see where things go with him.

If things go well, I might consider staying where I am and continuing with my current job. Still early but I am keeping that option open.

Anyways I met him through tinder. I did delete my account soon after matching him (because I was annoyed by people on the app). Now I don‚Äôt know if he is still active on there or not. 

However, given that we have been intimate, I feel the need to know if he‚Äôs dating other people. However, I don‚Äôt want him to feel like I‚Äôm putting pressure on him to only date me so early on.

Been dating this person (28F) for a little over a month now. Honestly, I‚Äôm just taking it really slow because she‚Äôs actually the first in a while after getting out of a LTR. Great conversations together, texting is a hit or miss at times but it‚Äôs still early in the game. I‚Äôve taken her to some great date spots‚Äî fun activities and dinner places/drinks. 

But am I missing her cues of disinterest? I‚Äôd try some physical flirting which she does not really do, and I do understand some people are just not touchy. I‚Äôd text her something flirty but nothing on her end. But she did text me during her trip out of town (which I did intrude because trying to do the right thing, haha). We do seem to have a great time in person during our dates, etc.

Ok so here‚Äôs the thing. She‚Äôs invited me to her place a few times now. We would have some drinks, watched Netflix, and chatted for hours. But nothing got physical. She hasn‚Äôt made any advances, is she waiting for me? I feel like part of me feels she just sees me as a friend at this point or is she playing coy/shy?

We have the same dark sense of humor and taste in music, basically the same person but opposite genders( been told by multiple people including his sister). He has a few textbook signs that a guy like you, but I dont know if he likes me or if im just overthinking it. For example whenever we are with a group of people he always looks at me when someone says something funny or when ever we are debating something or having a game night he always sides with me (idk if thats because were so alike or maybe cuz he likes me).  One time a friend sent a picture of us to him and he said that we were cute( like was he just being nice or am I way over thinking this). I see him maybe once a month because we have full time jobs, and go to college. I would try shoot my shot but my friend( the one who sent picture) likes him A LOT ( like obsessed) and he keeps on dodging her.  I dont know if hes dodging her because shes annoying or because he once mentioned doesn't want a relationship, like I always say that too but do want a relationship but with the right person.  is he saying that just cuz or does he really not want anything. not to mention we arent close at all but we grew up together( we have a looooot of mutual friends) is he just shy? does he like me? does he want a relationship?

Second date was dinner and seem to be going well, we had a good conversation. But I got more and more uncomfortable throughout the date and couldn‚Äôt figure out why. At the end she said she wanted to see me again, and then she went in for the kiss and kissed me passionately like six times. Yet I felt really confused and weird when I got home.

So a quick little backstory: 

‚Ä¢I'm 22 years old(f) 

‚Ä¢Boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years

‚Ä¢We just moved in together in April of 2019

‚Ä¢I'm currently studying to get a PhD in Neuroscience 

‚Ä¢I recently had two jobs but due to getting bullied at work adding to my already severe depression ( yes I went to HR, nothing happened to the person ) so I left that job

‚Ä¢ I now have one job where I work maybe two days a week, leaving me unable to afford to feed myself let alone pay rent

* recently had an argument where he blamed my depression and education on why he couldn't do anything better with his life and when does he get the chance to do that :/

My mother became worried so I told her what was going on. She told me to come live back home until I get on my feet again. But my long term boyfriend has told me if I move out we're broken up and I've spoken to him about it but he won't see my pov.

I guess I'm more so trying to see if what he's doing is right or wrong in your opinion. I'm worried I'm maybe not seeing it right either so yeah :x

I dated an ex for about a year until I finally decided to break up with him for good. No one liked him though and the reasons were valid. Of course, being young and having my first real boyfriend, I put my foot down every time. I get it, you want to protect your friend, sibling, child, or whatever but you HAVE to let them fall flat on their face to learn and I wish my former friends and my mom understood this. My mom would tell me all the time she didn't like him because she was ""so sure"" that he was married. I never found out if he was or not but I always had a gut feeling that I was more than likely his side piece.

Today, I'm in a wonderful relationship with a man who knows how to treat me the way I'm supposed to be treated and vice versa. I don't just thank my ex but I thank every other guy I've dated for learning from each one on what I did and did not want in a relationship.

t3_dla8uu,For those who started to date when older...,"Sorry in advance if this is long and messy. 

So I am in my late  20‚Äôs (f), and while I don‚Äôt believe that I am too old to never have dated anyone, when comparing to the group of people I grew up back in my hometown, I am the only one who has never dated. I have never kissed anyone. Have never been sexually active. Most of these people are either married or already starting a family. I don‚Äôt live in that town anymore but often times hear about them and how someone else just got married or how someone else is having a child. 

I am bi, so finding people attractive and being attracted to the has never been the problem. I truly don‚Äôt know why it is that I have never really been approached by someone who was interested in me. Although this isn‚Äôt entirely true, when I finally understood and acknowledged that I was bi, there was someone I started talking to but because I was living what I felt was a monumental time in my life, I wasn‚Äôt looking to date anyone then, I felt like it was a time for me to just fully, truly, and deeply be me. Plus, we were living far away from each other and I never saw them with intentions of dating, we were just friends but they developed feelings for me and I didn‚Äôt. Previous to that I had one major crush on someone I meet in college and almost made a move on them because they had been the first person I was starting to have feelings for, but I never made a move. This person was someone I truly wanted to date, even after much time had passed I would think about them and feel such regret that I didn‚Äôt asked them out. I did eventually stopped thinking about them. A couple of years ago, I meet someone else. I felt right away that I wasn‚Äôt going to like this person but boy was I in for a surprise. I‚Äôve always known what I want in life and from someone else, I‚Äôve always known what I want in a partner, and this person had it all, checked all the boxes. Except they were in a relationship. So you know I liked them but because they were dating someone else nothing really happened, I never said anything to them about my crush. However they tried to use me as a rebound and even if I really liked them that was something I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with, I just felt that if they liked me then they needed time to process their breakup and then we would talk if they so desired. But of course that never happened because they were just looking for a rebound.  

So I guess my question is, if you have been in a similar situation, what did you do to start dating? I feel like this is the step I‚Äôm stuck in. I don‚Äôt have low self-esteem, I do however am some who doesn‚Äôt do well in crowds so I‚Äôm usually uncomfortable there. I don‚Äôt really like to go out dancing or to bars because I‚Äôm just not cool with people just getting into my space simply because I‚Äôm out there dancing. I don‚Äôt do bars because I don‚Äôt drink. I don‚Äôt have many friends and I truly don‚Äôt know why this is. I never have people approach me, it sometimes feels like people don‚Äôt even notice me. I feel like I have so much love to give and so many things I want to experience with a partner yet it seems like no one wants that with me. I have never felt upset about it until recently, I see so many different couples, all kinds of couples so I just don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt have that as well?

I lived afraid that if I drew any bad attention to myself we would be taken away and I needed to be there for her.I was always trying to support her and never really lived for myself until the last 6 years or so . NONE of which is her fault ! I did that to myself as a young empathetic dumbass in over her head.

So,  later in life I started playing ttrpg's, made real friends, got a job and finally moved out! I'm so freaking happy! I had ups and downs with my Mom but there is a healthy balance now. I'm fucking THRIVING on my own!

I ALWAYS filtered life through overthinking and then giving up. So lately I've tried things out that I ""forbade"" myself. Being completely open with people who care about me, trying drinking, attending party's, creating and idk being a normal human?

This is where dating is becoming an issue. I daydream about romance A LOT. I never want kids or a dream wedding in my future but a person to be with would be nice.I understand though that fantasy is reality. However I've never dated anybody. The one date I did go on (middle school) was with a perfectly nice friend but I was going because I felt it would ""complete"" or fix me. I realized it was REALLY unhealthy and crappy to do so I broke it off pretty much right away. I didn't have any feelings for the guy other than friendship and I was projecting.  So based on that one experience I thought I was Ace.

Brilliant.

So after realizing I have  issues and working with a therapist on my past....I was just afraid of relationships and being vulnerable. So I've been working on that and tried flirting at a small party. The guy I was flirting with is a friend of my best friend. I honestly think he is a really funny cool person that I would like to get to know even as just a friend. However when I was attempting to flirt.....

It was so bad. Truly awkward as hell. I wish to die.

When I spoke to him like a normal person it was great and easy! However when I TRIED to be flirty and talk with just him I proceeded to inner panic mode. This was even further set off by his joking lewd comments (guess who has two thumbs and is also an virgin? This gal! Who woulda guessed?) and being slightly buzzed I probably gave the worst impression of myself. Its like I was simultaneously giving off ""lets be friends!"" and ""I'm sorta kinda flirting!"" vibes. This poor guy......I'm truly stupid. I got his number (and another friends as cover because I was so flustered by the whole thing....like dear god the mixed messages) but I haven't texted him at all.

So after the party I told my Bestie what has up. Him being in a wonderful longterm relationship (with a kickass queen of a G.F) has significantly more dating and relationship experience. I turned to him for advice and to vent my shame.

He proceeded to laugh his ass off and told me to ""Chill the fuck out and just talk to him like a normal person. If he's interested in will progress naturally and if not at least you might be friends"" however he told me he would casually ask him what he thought of me and the party when they next hangout.

So reading that whats do you guys think? Should I keep trying or since I'm happy with my life continue focusing on me? Thanks for reading!

t3_dleqfg,So this girl is interested in me.... I think,So this girl (I'll call her Beth)[19] is interested in me (25)  I know this because  today she called me out for flirting with other girls at work. We met at work at I have been playfully  flirting  with her since well we started back in August (Restaurant  recently  opened so we all started at the same time). We aren't  together  or anything  and I've asked her out multiple  times  but she seems to be always busy whenever I ask her out. And that's fine I understand she has her own life but I'm shooting my shot and well I thought Beth wasn't  interested so I moved on to other girls.

t3_dl7tqk,"I recently read a research article which states that 48% of men between the ages of 16-75 have sent women unsolicited dick pics. In your experience, would you say that this is accurate?","Because as a straight white Canadian man in his mid-20s, that number scares the hell out of me.

For those of you who haven't heard about this study, you can read about it in [this](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7xgaje/men-who-send-unsolicited-dick-pics-are-bigger-narcissists-study-finds) Vice article. According to the Montreal-based Society For The Scientific Study of Sexuality:

&gt; More than 1000 self-selecting straight men, ages 16 to 75, were recruited from various social media sites, a university-based research participant pool and Amazon Mechanical Turk to take part in the study. . . . Nearly half (48%) of those surveyed admitted to having sent an unsolicited dick pic in the past.

Based on these results, would it be safe for me to assume that in my personal life, among all the men that I have ever met, roughly *half* of them have sent a woman an unsolicited dick pic at some point in their lives? If I were to list out all of my male friends on a sheet of paper, can I safely assume that one out of every two of them has sent an unsolicited dick pic? If I see a pair of men talking to each other at a caf√© on any given day, it is more likely than not that at least one of them has sent a woman an unsolicited dick pic?

I know that dick pics are depressingly common, but I never thought that roughly half of all men have sent at least one in their lifetime to a woman who was not openly receptive to it. I thought it was a small minority of internet trolls and self-absorbed boneheads who get off on sending their dicks to as many women as they can, in the hopes of getting some kind of response.

I've never been more ashamed of being a man than I am when I read that number. 48%",dating_advice

t3_dlc35h,Found an old friend on Tinder,"Hey,

I've been trying out Tinder for the past week... No luck. My matches have been either ignored or went no where.

Well, tonight I was doing some swiping and I came across an old friend. I sat next to her in middle school and would casually talk off and on through high school. Funny thing was I had a huge crush on her but I never made the move. She's like my biggest regret because I'm pretty sure she felt something with me as well.

So I obviously swiped right on Tinder... but that just leaves me thinking if there's something more I could do. Tinder has been a loss cause since guys get hidden by a sea of other guys. Who knows if she will even see my profile?

Luckily, she actually goes to the same college as me. I unfortunately haven't seen her at all this entire semester. I used to see her off and on and we would maybe say ""Hi"" or a wave but nothing more.

Other than that, I don't have any contact with her at all... I still remember her last name and I found her on Facebook, but I really don't know how to approach this. I'd add her, but I haven't talked to her in over 4 years and probably haven't seen her in over a year. I feel like adding her on Facebook randomly would make things odd? She also has her instagram listed on her tinder profile, but I don't have an instagram and that feels even worse if I make an instagram specifically to talk to her.

Any ideas on how I could establish communication and lead on from there? And once I do, how the heck do I actually know if she's interested.",dating_advice

When he goes back to school though he kinda ghosts me. We will snapchat back and forth maybe once or twice every other week but one of us doesn‚Äôt reply. It‚Äôs SO CONFUSING  but I‚Äôve gotten used to it being that way. ANYWAYS

I‚Äôve come up with a few ideas on how to ask him out or simply start off with a ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs go get Taco Bell‚Äù or something and i plan on doing that when he comes back home for thanksgiving. I‚Äôm going to my friends wedding in Minnesota In June of next year and i want to ask him to be my plus one. I‚Äôm just so nervous from past relationships trauma (complete fucked up shit.

He is so far the best guy I have ever dated. Meanwhile, it is apparent that he really likes me too. He is extremely nerdy and sometimes awkward and I have a firey and feisty personality. We have a lot in common and get along really well; I enjoy every single second with him. However, I am really not sure how can I open up to him and start talking about our relationship.

When we hang out, things are pretty nice even though we are both really shy. Then, it gets heated and we end up making out here and there. When we are not together, communication is not as heated or as exciting. There is no flirting over text and we have never talked on the phone either. Our conversations are mostly about politics and other nerdy things and rarely about ourselves. He has recently started giving me compliments but nothing else. We have not really talked about where we want to go with whatever we are right now and I don't know how I can initiate the conversation aka break this ice.

You might think that a month is not much time and maybe I am expecting things to move too fast. I am getting a little anxious because I really like this person and want to be with him, yet I don't want to blow it away by sounding needy and asking for a hard commitment (I do want a commitment though).

We‚Äôve gone on 4 dates, texting each other every day when we are free and the chemistry is so strong that we are feeling it‚Äôs getting serious. But it‚Äôs a dating with deadline because he will have to go back to his own country in mid-January next year, so we both know it won‚Äôt last very long.

On Sunday in our fourth date, he again told me that he is not interested in seeing other girls anymore. So I guess we are exclusively dating now.

But also on Sunday he brought the serious problem up ‚Äî we will have to leave each other in two months, so he is afraid if we keep seeing each other like this, we are going to be heartbroken at the end. He also said every time when he felt he is getting serious with a girl, he is nervous and afraid. I said I don‚Äôt mind if I‚Äôm his girlfriend or not, we don‚Äôt have to label our relationship, just enjoy the time spent with each other.

Also we had sex for the first time that evening and the condom broke, even though I took a pill as soon as possible, this accident still gave him a lot pressure. (He didn‚Äôt even cum at that moment so the pregnancy chance is really low)

Yesterday when I talked to him in text, I could feel that he is a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù. So my female instincts made me to open Tinder again, only to find that he updated his Tinder profile just few hours ago(rearranged the order of his photos).

t3_dld3lz,Need advice in how I [M26] should proceed,"Obligatory: Excuse me if some parts aren't clear. English is my second language. Also I am not a good writer.

I need your opinions on this. First of some backstory:

‚Äã

First off: -We are both university students

-There are no more than one or two messages of each other during the day. Honestly, it's mostly because she doesn't answer fast and I don't wanna message too much.

There is this girl I currently talk to. I met her during a ""flatmate casting"". That's basically us looking for another flatmate, not sure how you guys call this. We had an ad up for the free room, some people who were interested messaged us and we met up in order to decide who's best for us. She was one of them. We had to decline her (basically because of my other flatmate), but since I had nothing to lose I asked her if I should show her around the city once she moved into the city. She actually said yes, she would like to. We met up during her first few days after she moved. I showed her around the city, some good locations for drinking, food, etc. During that she dropped a hint that it would be cool, that there should be a ""bar hopping tour"" (I can't rephrase it properly), since some of those locations look quite interesting from the outside.

I got the hint and asked her to do so. We set up a date and went for it. During the supposed meetup she already mentioned that she could not be on time and asked if we could delay it for about an hour, as well as that she could not hang out that long because she had to get up early due to some circumstances. I told her that it would be okay and that it would be also okay to reschedule another day. Her answer was to just delay it for about an hour. My personal mistake was choosing the first location. We had to sit opposite of each other, which didn't allow me for some light touching (I'm inexperienced, so I read up some stuff online and this was mentioned fairly often). But we had a great conversation and a drink or two. Afterwards we went to another pub, which was not a good choice either because the other guests were kinda oldish (no offense there) which led to a. weird(?) atmosphere. I can't describe it properly. The whole evening lasted for about ~3 hours. After that she said that she should go now, because she had to get up early (as mentioned before). So this was no surprise for me and didn't look like an excuse (unless she planned it beforehand).

After parting ways I told her that I had fun and she said that she did have fun aswell. A few days later I asked her if she wanted to go minigolfing. Her answer was yes, but she couldn't confirm it for 100%, because she had a lot of stuff planned during the week and sunday would probably be her only day off. I said sure, no worries. Message me if you any better.

Sunday comes and she messaged me, that she could not follow the plan because she's been exhausted from too much partying. I said something along the lines of, that it's okay and we've all been in this position and wished her a relaxing sunday evening.

Now I need some opinions on the following:

-how would you guys understand my initial meetup idea (showing around through the city)? Would you guys consider it just as a friendly thing or could I expect that she had the idea of a date aswell?

-how should I continue approaching this situation, I don't wanna only text ""hey [...] wanna do XYZ"". But texting about other stuff takes a few days with her, because she replies pretty slowly.

t3_dl8j2p,How should I [M26] proceed,"Obligatory: Excuse me if some parts aren't clear. English is my second language. Also I am not a good writer.

I need your opinions on this. First of some backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

First off: -We are both university students

\-There are no more than one or two messages of each other during the day. Honestly, it's mostly because she doesn't answer fast and I don't wanna message too much.

There is this girl I currently talk to. I met her during a ""flatmate casting"". That's basically us looking for another flatmate, not sure how you guys call this. We had an ad up for the free room, some people who were interested messaged us and we met up in order to decide who's best for us. She was one of them. We had to decline her (basically because of my other flatmate), but since I had nothing to lose I asked her if I should show her around the city once she moved into the city. She actually said yes, she would like to. We met up during her first few days after she moved. I showed her around the city, some good locations for drinking, food, etc. During that she dropped a hint that it would be cool, that there should be a ""bar hopping tour"" (I can't rephrase it properly), since some of those locations look quite interesting from the outside.

I got the hint and asked her to do so. We set up a date and went for it. During the supposed meetup she already mentioned that she could not be on time and asked if we could delay it for about an hour, as well as that she could not hang out that long because she had to get up early due to some circumstances. I told her that it would be okay and that it would be also okay to reschedule another day. Her answer was to just delay it for about an hour. My personal mistake was choosing the first location.

Afterwards we went to another pub, which was not a good choice either because the other guests were kinda oldish (no offense there) which led to a. weird(?) atmosphere. I can't describe it properly. The whole evening lasted for about \~3 hours. After that she said that she should go now, because she had to get up early (as mentioned before). So this was no surprise for me and didn't look like an excuse (unless she planned it beforehand).

I thought I'd just try and see if this is something advice from kind strangers might help me out with. Hope this question fits the subs rules.

First off; I'm 25y male and am very awkward in meaningful relationships with woman. I can't figure out why exactly, but it's there like this as long as I can remember. I do have a lot of friends (male and female) and am generally quite confident with myself and in a lesser way confident ish with my body.

Over the past years I've actually had a couple girls hit on me in a very obvious way. Though my fear of fucking things up (mainly upsetting someone by misreading their signals) has always made me lock up in all of those situations. Even though I keep telling myself to not be scared the next time, it's something I can't seem to control. My whole life has been evolving around treating everyone equal and to never make anyone upset or dislike me. I usually see this as one of my best qualities but my fear of making someone disgust me by making the wrong move just locks me up into a place where I'm starving of some phisical attention. Not even sex or anything, but someone to hug and someone to talk to and show affection and love to.

It's starting to really depress me to have a lot of friends and quite some girls with whom I have great relationships and even potential for more but to now have the fear I'll never be able to get over this and continue the rest of my life lonely.

I'd take any advice on this really; harsh, obvious. Anything. I've told myself so many times it won't matter to try it once but the logical reasoning gets overshadowed by my impuls to not upset or disgust anyone.

Today he cancelled on me, and said he had ""breathing problems"" from playing sport over the weekend and needs to get checked out. The catch is, i've been looking at his insta stories on an alt and he was very active on there following females and posting stories for a person that is ""ill"".  I responded back telling him he wasted my time, and that he shouldn't had initiated asking me on a date if he wasn't interested.

Nevertheless, this destroyed the tiniest bit of confidence and self esteem I've ever had. He could be telling the truth, or could be lying.  I am very much aware that I have invested too much of my own feelings and time in to this.

[yes this relaxes the rule a bit. An update on the Updates Rule is in here as well]","**TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

t3_b2nc2f,[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened‚Äîyour account‚Äîwith each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

Yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. It's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***Comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. If you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

t3_dljukt,"My GF (28F) Joked About Male Enlargement Pills, I (28M) Brushed it Off.... Two Days Later She Says ""I Bought You Something..""","The title says it all, but I will elaborate a bit more here:

On Saturday, my GF of two years did something that somewhat hurt my feelings/destroyed my manhood a bit. She sent me a link and to some of those male enlargement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. I thought she was just joking so I ""LOL'd,"" said no, and brushed it off. When I saw her yesterday (Monday), she said ""I have something for you."" To my surprise, she pulled out a bottle of those pills.

I said, ""What the F\*\*\*, are you serious right now? Really?"" She said, ""Relax I'm not saying you are not big enough. I just want to choke on an extra inch or three of you. I thought you would be cool with it."" I said, ""First of all, that is not for you to decide. Secondly, why would I do that for you? I'm comfortable with my endowment. Lastly, IF I were to consider this as a possiblity, you do know all of that is false adverting right? That stuff does not work."" She said, ""There is only one way to find out. Here, take them."" I told her to leave and have not uttered a word to her. My phone is still blowing up with texts and calls. From the texts and voicemails, I can tell she did not expect me to tell her to leave. I kept cool as all of this was happening because I thought she was still kidding...

It irritates me that she did this. I wouldn't say she isn't happy with my size, but clearly her actions are alluding to this without her having to even say it. My question is, dear Redditors, am I overthinking/overreacting? I am considering ending it. She has apologized but I fear the damage is done. What she did was uncalled for and should only be done if one is insecure about their size. I still love her, but this stings still! Should I break it off? What should I say? Is there a way to recover from this?

P.S. I did tell her, ""OK, I will take the pills, but only if you get a boob job."" She said ""Yes because I love you."" üòÇ

**UPDATE/EDIT 1**: Wow. This shit blew up faster than my penis if I would have taken those pills for 30 Days. **MANY of you provided great feedback. THANK YOU**. Yes, her and I are having a serious discussion about it tonight. I texted her during my lunch and she keeps apologizing and reminding me that no matter what she still loves me and that she should have realized this was not a good idea. She asked if I could talk to her on phone for a min or too and I agreed.  I took her call. She's devastated and said that she is scared I won't trust her nor want to be physically intimate with her. She is very upset so I calmed her down. I told her I love her but that this needs to be seriously discussed and find a way to move on. Like may of you suggested **I WILL NOT NOR PLAN ON TAKING THEM.** And to everyone who said she is stupid/idiot, I get it. What she did is indeed stupid but she is not like that 99% of the time. Also, those of you how think this is a fake post: Kindly fuck off.

**Update/Edit 2:** Getting a lot of ""what is your size"" questions. I have nothing to fear. Here it is: **5.1inches and proud of it.**",relationship_advice
t3_dlklea,My dad falsely accused me of molestation and now wants me back in the family.,"So this is quite a long story and I‚Äôm new here so sorry if I miss something or edit back. 

Back in 2017 I went on a family vacation, important people and age at the time myself (21m) dad (40m) and sister(15f). Somehow on the last day of this vacation my sister came up with this idea that I molested her. This was completely random, no context it just happened. My dad came to me in a flurry of anger and very aggressively threw against the floor and wall without saying anything. Once I was able to sit and respond with probably like wtf he told me what she said. I was stunned and confused and explained that I never had done anything to her. He then told me my best friend (who lives 1000 miles away and had never met my family) told my sister I did it because I confided in my friend. This was the first major red flag for me that this wasn‚Äôt a joke or some shit but they were being serious. 

Now for some context. I am the oldest of 9. When I was 5 I myself was ‚Äúsexually abused‚Äù by my ex-stepsister (moms ex husbands daughter? She was maybe 12 at this time) but I am the oldest. I didn‚Äôt know any better and it never bothered me a ton later on. We were kids. Saying that I was still the oldest and when I got to that 10-12 range I definitely got curious about human anatomy and I will say it here. I was a peeping Tom on my 6 year old sister. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. What I was looking at. Or what to do with it. And I never touched her. I was nothing more that a curious 10 year old child who was the oldest in his family. It took me a long time to be willing to accept that. 

This happened the second to last day of vacation. I slept alone and flew home the next day, they drove. I lived alone and hardly saw them due to distance but tried to go twice a month. I stopped contacting them and they all blocked my phone number, fb, etc. except my dad who continued to text call and harass me. My sister went to the police when we got home where the story changed to she found it in my phone which could have been possible as she had my old phone. I had to deal with state and dcf, and then the local police from the town we grew up where this would have happened. I met with an officer after playing phone tag for nearly 2 months with him and dcf leaving eachother voicemails a few times a week. When I met with him we talked over what happened on vacation, the accusations, and what happened to me as a child. That was the end of it from the police. My dad continued to text me so I blocked him finally. About 6 months go by and he calls my work phone which was emergencies only. I had forgotten he had that number. He basically said that the DA was filing paperwork to have me arrested, the fbi would be taking me and some other over the top stuff. It all seemed way too much but I called that officer I spoke with to check in and he had nothing new for me he said to call the da office so I did and there were no cases in my name or my fathers(he would have to represent my sister). After this we went quiet for 6 months until my aunt(mother‚Äôs side) called me cause she ran into my dad at Home Depot and he told her all these terrible things I did. She asked me and I explained everything and she was all good and no longer concerned about me with any of it. Then a few of my friends found out when he told them. Then some people I work with. After about a year I quit my job to get away from it all, changed phone numbers and moved across the country. Right when I moved I found out my sister just had a baby, at 16. 6 months later my dad emailed me asking to go see my grandfather on his deathbed and my sisters baby ‚Äúlet her show you the baby, let her tell you about the baby she really wants to‚Äù we‚Äôre his exact words. I said I moved across country and couldn‚Äôt and never responded again. 

Now it‚Äôs been about a year and he has been emailing an old email I use for spam for a few months begging me to text him or call him as he can‚Äôt live like this anymore and needs me back. I‚Äôm honestly torn on if I should reply to see what he has to say or just keep moving forward with my new life. So... any advice? 

Sorry if this sounds like a random jumble of words I don‚Äôt have time to proof read atm and will answer as much as I can‚Äôt after work. Thank you

Edit: a lot of people are saying to see therapy or confused on the timeline. 

She would have gotten pregnant roughly 4 months after this happened, lining up nicely with her 16th birthday. There‚Äôs no way I can be accused of being the father. 

Second, the first year or so until I moved was hard. Leaving my job which I loved was hard. But moving across the country to where I always wanted to live was extremely therapeutic for me and I took a few months here to recollect and find myself. I may still go to therapy in the future but honestly I‚Äôm happy with my life and without them. 

Lastly, the consensus is don‚Äôt contact them as it could be a trap, if I did I would use a fake number or throwaway phone. And it would be to see what he has to say, if he would apologize, not to go back.

Edit2: Wow this has gotten way more attention than I imagined. Let me clarify a few things here, 

No i did not have pictures of my sister, The accusation of her finding stuff on my old phone was that I had made a note in the notes app directed towards my best friend. Her 3rd and final story change was that she found this message(First being my best friend told her, Second saying she found it in out texts), I honestly don't know if this message exists but it very well may as she(my best friend) did know about this already and helped me cope because damn it was hard to accept that I looked at someone as a child. 

My sister, to my knowledge, did not want to press charges. However her BF (who was on vacation with us) told her to go to the school counselor, who then is forced to contact police, DCF, etc. That is how it got to police, not her directly doing it. My dad told me to turn myself in before any of the police debacle started which I didn't, I then played phone tag with DCF and the local officer of our home town for over 2 months, they only called me at 4pm on friday's. We left lots of voicemails. But because my sister was underage my Dad had to be in-charge of case decision making or something, not entirely sure, hes never been the best at texting which is where i got this information from before blocking him and changing numbers. 

Thank you all so much for the kind support, I never would have imagined that this would be my first post on Reddit. And thank you those asking for more info, I wrote this in a rush on my lunch break as I've been thinking about it for a few days and just wanted to do it and there is so much more little detail that could be added but i simply do not have the time.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnu8d,Girlfriend (20F) and her friend (20F) 'tested' to see if I (20M) I would cheat.,"Errr I really don't know how to feel. Though I'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. My gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so I did. She wasn't there yet, but her friend was. We chatted for a while and she started being playful, but I brushed it off. Playful turned into flirting and I felt super awkward. Before I got up she kissed me and I left right after that and called my gf. I explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. I couldn't believe it tbh, I thought she was joking at first. First she was mad that I 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much I could do. And I don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? I've never heard of someone setting up their SO and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

Where do I go from here. She has apologized (half-assed that is) but I kinda don't want to speak to her right now. We're together for 6 months.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmbdf,My fiance broke up with me because my parents have a non conventional marriage...,"We've been together for 6 years. We've known each other for another three years before that, so 9 years total. We're getting married in February. Or we were, I don't know any more. We're visiting my parents to meet some more of my extended family, so they get to know him before the wedding. My parents offered to host us, and we've been staying in my old room. I'm \[F29\], he's \[M32\].

We are staying with my parents. My fiance wanted to stay at a hotel, but I thought it will be fun to sleep in my old room. And to be here with my mom and dad one last time under their roof before I become a married woman.

My parents have been in a non conventional marriage for a long time. It was a shock for me to learn about it, and I learnt to cope with it. I am not necessarily comfortable with their life styles, but I can't do anything about it. They basically go on dates with other people, spend time with other people, sleep with other people. Had to learn it when I came home a few days earlier from a trip with a friend's family, and my father was sleeping next to another woman, when I was 16. I freaked out then, and my parents had to explain to me it was all fine.

So my fiance could not sleep last night, and went outside for some fresh air because he is not used to sleep away from our bed back home. And he found my mom kissing another guy in my parent's foyer.

So he freaked out, started yelling at her, came and woke me up, demanded I call my father and tell him he found my mom cheating on him.

So my mom had to explain to my fiance about my parent's non conventional marriage, but it didn't go well with him. And once it seemed like he is calming down and starts to accept what my mom was telling him, he figured out I knew about their marriage, and he started freaking out on me.

He told me that he can't trust me any more, that he was set up, that I insisted we stay with our parents so that I can ease him in the idea, so I can enforce my parents principles on our own marriage, and I simply can't get through to him.

My fiance has been cheated on before, his parents have divorced because his mom cheated on his dad, and he doesn't have a good relationship with her, he could barely stomach the idea of having her come to our wedding.

He went to a hotel for tonight, and said he will be leaving back home tomorrow. he's not really answering his phone or texting back.

he says he needs to reevaluate our engagement, that he doesn't think he can marry me knowing I approve my parents marriage style. That I wanted to manipulate him and introduce this life style in our relationship.

The truth is I am ashamed of my parents and their relationships, and I had no idea they will behave like this while my fiance is around, let alone sleeping in their house. he simply doesn't believe me because I haven't talked about it since I've met him. It's not something I find easy to talk about, and the less I think about it the better.

How can I talk with him? I have no interest in my parents style of relationship, I am fully dedicated to my fiance, and I have never been interested in another person since I've met him.

I don't want to lose him over this stupid thing, and I feel ashamed he had to find out about my parents like this. I'd have preferred he never knew.

Please, if anyone has any ideas, I am interested in any suggestions.

Thank you.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmm59,My [26M] girlfriend [26F] moaned the name of a male friend [26M] during the most intimate sex we've ever had.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. She told me that she loved me a few months ago. I am in love with her as well. We do almost everything together -- we are also coworkers (I am leaving the job in December, thank God). I've never once doubted her commitment to the relationship. I have never really felt jealous of other people hitting on her. Never had the urge to check her phone or any of that toxic shit. Cut to: 

This weekend, where my girlfriend was the Maid Of Honor at her best friend's wedding. We'll call the bride ""M"" and the groom ""A."" It was a wonderful weekend, beautiful ceremony, etc. After the reception, we went back to the hotel and had pretty intense sex. The kind where you're talking about a future together, etc. During this  incredibly intimate moment she moaned ""oh my god, A."" 

Me and ""A"" do not have the same name. There could be no mistaking it was his name. Immediately I got off and packed my things into my suitcase. I left and headed to the airport. 

She has been insanely apologetic and says she has no idea where this came from. I don't believe her and ""A"" have ever had sex. My girlfriend insists that they've never had sex and she's never even thought about him like that. Obviously there is now plenty of doubt in my mind. I do not trust my girlfriend anymore. I feel betrayed. Hurt. And I don't know how to get past this, or if I can get past this. 

So naturally I came to the internet for advice. Thanks.",relationship_advice
t3_dljm8e,Brother (28M) who sexually assaulted me (21F) as a child is trying to contact me,"Warning, this post contains sensitive, personal information. 

I had a rough childhood in the sense that things were unstable, my father abandoned us (I was 6) and my mother was an absent heroin addict. My father was very abusive and beat my brother and me for the dumbest things (not finishing dinner or not cleaning our room) but he left us for what I‚Äôm now sure was a prostitute. I grew up in the suburbs of a somewhat large city with just one older brother (I had a half sister I met a few times, also a drug addict like my mom, died from overdose). For most of my childhood my brother took care of me and made sure I was safe while our mom was out getting high. However, when I was 8 years old and he was 15 it was like he became a completely different person. My brother started to get into trouble at school; in one case he brutally beat a boy two years his senior almost to death. He got into a lot of trouble with the cops, but my mother was not there to guide him down the right path. He started down an ugly path of destruction (arson, robbery, and joined a gang). 


NSFW WARNING

I remember the first night he violated me and probably always will despite years of therapy. We shared a bedroom in a shitty apartment (mom was on welfare, we were poor) and he came in on a school night probably around 11-12 at night. I woke up when he was trying to sneak in, but he wasn‚Äôt very inconspicuous and I am a light sleeper. He stood probably a foot away from my bed and I could smell alcohol on him. It was weird because he spoke to me very softly and what seemed gentle and not hurtful when he said we were going to play a game and I had to wear his bandanna as a blindfold. I thought we were going to play hide and seek (I was 8, didn‚Äôt know any better) but he covered my mouth with his hand, lifted up my nightgown, tore off my underwear, and molested me for what felt like an eternity. I had no idea what was happening at first and didn‚Äôt even understand when it was all happening but I cried and whimpered and my body was so tense. He molested me with his hands and a metallic, cold object. I think I eventually passed out from the pain and not being able to breathe (he covered my mouth the whole time). When I got up for school the next morning he was already gone, my mother was gone too, and I was home alone supposed to get myself ready for school (not unusual for me). There was blood in my sheets and I was very confused. I went to school as normal but sometime in the afternoon there was blood in my pants. I went to the school nurse who assumed I was having my period, gave me pads, and sent me on my way. A couple months went by before he attacked me again, this time I didn‚Äôt smell alcohol, he just seemed so angry and was being very aggressive. He did not blindfold me or cover my mouth this time, instead he penetrated my anus as I cried loudly and begged him to stop but mom wasn‚Äôt home and nobody was going to save me. I tried to fight back by scratching at his face and trying so hard to get out from under him but he was already 6 feet tall at 15 years old and I wasn‚Äôt strong enough. The next and last time he attacked me he was 16 and I was 9. I think I got somewhat of amnesia during the time that passed because I didn‚Äôt remember what happened until he raped me for the last time and it all came back. My mother came home with some random druggie guys and they were probably all getting high in the living room when I was getting ready to go to bed. My brother was not home and who the hell knows what he was doing, I don‚Äôt even want to know. When he got home my mom was already passed out I guess, but her boyfriends were still there. This time was the worst and the scariest. He got ready for bed (he usually just came in and crashed or spent the whole night out) so it was weird to me he was taking a bath and brushing his teeth or whatever. He came into our room and I was just starting to fall asleep. He climbed into my bed and I laid as still as possible pretending to be asleep. He whispered in the dark to me in the most terrifying and dead voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. He grabbed my throat, mounted me, and penetrated my vagina. It was so sudden and so vicious and awfully painful. I screamed this time, for the first time I was able to find my voice, and one of my moms boyfriends came bursting in yelling and beat the shit out of my brother. My brother was arrested and I tried to forget everything for the next 12 years. He was put in juvey, had to attend therapy, and diagnosed with antisocial disorder. I was amazed how much my mother reacted and how she changed completely, she attended rehab (first time left, but second time stayed and got so much better). We moved into a new apartment and stayed there until I was 17. I graduated high school and moved to a new city to go to community college and work full time. My mom passed away from a long battle with HIV/AIDS when I just turned 18. My brother ended up in prison for a few years doing time for robbery. I struggled with my moms loss especially since we were closer now and she became the mom I really needed. My brother got out of prison a week ago and since has tried to make contact with me. I live on my own and was terrified when I got a missed call from him asking if he could borrow money. His ‚Äúapology‚Äù sounded very sincere on the phone but he was always a charming kind of person and I have no intention to see him or help him. I contacted the police but there‚Äôs nothing they can do for now and changed my number. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to forgive my brother and he‚Äôs probably just trying to use me. I‚Äôve been staying with my friend to be safe. I don‚Äôt know what to do. So much shit has happened in my life it‚Äôs really affecting me and I feel like I‚Äôm going to have a full blown break down.

t3_dlqmsl,I (25F) looked through my boyfriends (25M) texts and saw degrading and hurtful messages he sent to his friend about my body/other women,"I want to start by saying yes I know it was wrong to look through his phone and is a violation of privacy, I normally wouldn‚Äôt but I was sensing he wasn‚Äôt happy/ satisfied anymore. (Also he has looked through mine in the past - not that that makes it right for me to do it) 

So he was talking to his friend through text and said ‚Äúman fat asses make me melt. __‚Äôs ass got fatter over our relationship but it‚Äôs just not the same as those oversized throw pillows. Lmfao cut the titties off and n put it in the ass. I could have a a flat chested girl if she had all the ass in the world.‚Äù  (side note if you didn‚Äôt gather I have really big boobs and a plump but def not huge butt) 

Then the friend said he saw a Jessica lookalike at work (Jessica is a girl my bf briefly/ almost had a thing with before we dated). So my bf said ‚Äúman I miss Jessica‚Äôs booty. She‚Äôll hit me up once in a while but I have to keep it insignificant lmao‚Äù  then he talked about some girl at work he vibes with really well and misses when she‚Äôs not at work, sounds like he has a crush on her although he didn‚Äôt say that flat out. 

So I‚Äôm just really torn.  I love him to death we‚Äôve been dating four years, we moved across the country together and I don‚Äôt want to break up with him, but at the same time I don‚Äôt think I can feel sexy or confident in bed anymore. I know it‚Äôs normal as human beings to be attracted to other people, but I wish it didn‚Äôt have to be said in such a degrading way. Is this just normal guy talk for men in relationships?

t3_dllky8,My ex girlfriend is telling everyone I cheated on her.,"My ex girlfriend or two years has decided it'd be fun to drag my name through the mud, for some context; she broke up with me because she no longer saw a future with me due to me not being a Christian. After she broke up with me we tried to remain friends (unsuccessfully) she would tell me about random dudes she was trying to sleep with and even once called me crying because she got high and fucked a guy 5 years older than her. Anyway (sorry off topic)

 I offhandedly mentioned that at one point whilst we were dating I started daveloping feelings for one of my friends, because of these feelings I told my friend I needed to take a step back and they were understanding. Then my ex imploded in on herself like a dying star, she called me a cheater, told me to kill myself, told me she still loved me? It was weird.. but I thought ""eh she has a boyfriend I have a girlfriend what does it matter""
Boy was I wrong! She has now told everyone we've ever been friends with that I cheated on her and a lot of them have sent me lovely messages telling me what a horrible monster I am for cheating on her. I even got a text from her grandmother telling me how disappointed she in me.

t3_dlgx21,"My bf (24m) gets angry every time I (21f) say no to sex, and the other day I felt like I had no choice but to do it","Edit  (And update I guess). - I‚Äôve read each and every reply and want to thank people for being so helpful and telling me like it is. I am going to call my family and ask for help in getting out. I have a place to crash while I look for another place. I appreciate all of the advice &lt;3

Also wanted to explain a few things. Some people can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôd even bother posting on here, or that I must know it‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm ridiculous for even questioning it. It‚Äôs also ironic to me that I would have to question things like this, being a psychology student doing my postgrad. But the truth is, this was the first incident like this where I was actually scared of him. Everything has been subtle up until that point and I was in shock and not thinking clearly about it. It was confusing and scary and after the initial shock wore off I started to realize this wasn‚Äôt something I could excuse. 

I knew from the disgusted responses that this was definitely not okay so it confirmed what I thought and I knew the first thing I needed to do was to tell my family so that I would have their support. It‚Äôs also more difficult I find to see things clearly when it‚Äôs happening to you personally - it would be much more clear if a friend told me it happened to her. Sometimes you‚Äôve gotta be told the truth by other people when you‚Äôre doubting your own judgement. I deleted the post because I feel I got the answers I need from it, so thank you. 

The second thing is that weirdly I feel like the issue was not sexual incompatibility. We still had regular, almost daily sex up until now, and the only reason it‚Äôs not more than once a day anymore is because I had so many deadlines to meet in college all at once and didn‚Äôt have the time or energy. So I think maybe this wasn‚Äôt about the sex but he has issues of his own and he made it about the sex. Not that it matters either way I guess, because it still doesn‚Äôt make it right.",relationship_advice

I have 5 younger siblings all in their late teens to mid twenties. I live with all of them, its the culture I grew up in. You don't move out until you're married. I'm single, never married. I've never been in a serious relationship before. I'm definitely religious, but not a virgin.
This all began when I began working for the government with in a department I won't mention due to privacy. I was there for a year, worked 40 hours a week, kept my head down, etc. Then around Jan 2019 my boss was leaving to another department. I applied for the position but didn't get the job. Instead, they hired a new girl from the private sector.

We were around the same age. She's only 2 years older than me. But we couldn't be any different. She's white, tattooed, atheist. I'm Somali (black), Muslim, I introduced myself and she smiled at me. I tried to speak but I stuttered (I grew up with a stuttering problem but I outgrew it, however it comes back from time to time). I hurried back in my desk in embarrassment.
The first few months were normal.It was a huge learning curve for her. A lot of people questioned the hire but she quickly proved people wrong. She was smart, quick thinker, witty, no filter (once you get to know her).

That winter, I came out of the office one Friday afternoon and saw her car wasn't starting. It was super cold, and I gave her a boost. She was incredibly thankful and hugged me. I didn't think of it at all and went about my business.
Every month I have our monthly 1 on 1 meetings to discuss my performance. At first it was business as usual. But as the months wore on these meetings became more and more just as talking and catching up. She would ask me questions and we would chat about virtually anything. I also knew for a fact that she didn't do this for others. She was extremely professional with them. Again, my naive self didn't connect the dots. I know, stupid.

Meanwhile, at home, my mother is a commanding presence. I'm a 27 year old grown man and she lets me be usually, but still annoys me. If its after midnight she still calls asking where I am. Its super annoying but I love her to death. She's also been pushing me to get married. She keeps telling me that she knows many young girls back in Somalia that would be interested. I laugh it off but I knew she was serious.

Anyway, my boss at work would message me on the MSN chat that we have set up at work. It was just a casual conversation. One day when I was talking to her (I stutter and sometimes talk fast), I mentioned my brother, she misheard and thought I said my ""brother in law"". Her entire expression changed, as if it bothered her if I was married. When I clarified that she gave me a beamed smile. Hr smile was very attractive to me.
Then she added me on facebook. We chatted some more. Just friendly things. I considered telling a coworker who I trust, but I figured I couldn't do it. Too much gossip and just wasn't worth it.

Then came a celebration this past summer. A coworker invited all of us to Boston Pizza and many people from work came. I never drank a sip of alcohol in my life up until that point. I felt a little hazed but since I had half a cup I was still pefectly ok. I realized it was only me and her walking out together. There was a cab right in front of the place and I got in. I thought she was walking me to my cab but she went in the cab too. She gave the driver the address. I was shocked. Stunned. Mystified. When she touched my leg and started messaging my thigh I had a huge boner and couldn't control myself.
We went back to her apartment and had sex. Incredible sex. And yes, I used protection. She was so attractive it was mind boggling. She said she would get a tattoo with my name on it on her ass cheek. That turned me on more. She taught me different positions I didn't think of before.
I spent the night with her. The I panicked. I looked at my phone. It was 430am and I had 34 missed calls from my mother. I called her back telling her I was with my friend and would be staying at his for the night. I texted my friend and he covered for me. I know its pathetic at age 27 but what can you do.

The next morning I left and she kissed me goodbye. I left with regret because I went against my religion.

But it didn't end there.

The next working day she walked by my desk and handed me a small piece of paper. It had her number on it. I texted her and we swapped all of sorts of stuff to each other.
Long story short, I spent a lot of time at her apartment for the next 3-4 months. At first, the thrill and excitement was amazing. But then I began to really like her. But I was torn. I love my family too. But there was no way in a million years my mother would ever accept a her. Especially given that she's atheist.
Then the nightmare really began: I got a text from her saying she wanted to discuss something. I honestly thought it was because she wanted to end things. Which hurt me, but I thought it was for the best. When we did meet, she started with ""I didn't have my period this month"". It still didn't click for me. Then the following two words gave me a heart attack almost.

""I'm pregnant"".

My world shattered that instant. I thought to myself, ""how"". I've used protection every time I've been with her. But that didn't matter.
Then it hit me what I've been doing. I've been sleeping with my boss for 4 months now, putting both of our careers in jeopardy, and I've gotten her pregnant. To a girl my mother would NEVER EVER accept. Not only that, but this is not how I wanted to have a child.
But at the same time, I do like her. She's incredibly smart, attractive, fit, and really caring. However, with that being said, she can have some violent outbursts at times. She's not a morning person and can get extremely moody. But nobody is perfect.

She told me she is having the child whether I'm going to be involved or not. She told me she has feelings for me and is willing to try a relationship but not at this point in our careers at work. Abortion is out of the question anyway, its against my values and beliefs.

She told me I should tell my mother, but I don't have the stomach for it. I love my mother to death. I'd take a bullet for her anytime. But this would break her heart. She is incredibly religious and I know her. SHE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THIS. I don't want to burden her more, she has already been through a lot.

I like my girlfriend I guess you can call it, but I don't love her. I care about her future and her well being, but I'm conflicted if she's the person I want something long term with.

What should I do? I'm ready to be a father, but not like this? My family will disown me. They wouldn't want to meet her. My community will shun me.

I've never been depressed like this before. Any solid advice would be appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_dlgs6u,Me (25m) and my girlfriend (21f) had a huge fight regarding her upcoming birthday due to different expectations.,"Hello everybody!

Im posting this from my throwaway for obvious reasons.

I will try to keep this short. Yesterday, I confronted my girlfriend about her odd behaviour over the course of the last days. Initially she said that everything was fine and that she is just feeling a bit ill (flu season). After I kept asking (since I knew something was up) she told me that she is disappointed with me because I am not spending her birthday with her. 

Short disclaimer: her birthday is in 2 days and of course, since I know it means a lot to her, I did not make any plans for that day. However, I have 2 lectures at university where attendance is mandatory (note: in our country you can miss 2 appointments. However, if you miss more than 2, you will not pass the course). Knowing this since weeks I told her that im gonna prepare breakfast for us, then head to uni around 9.45 and come back around 2, to spend the afternoon with her. 

Back to yesterday! After she told me that, I was quite buffled since I made a point of making time for her on that day. After asking what she meant she replied the following: ""You obviously dont care enough, otherwise you would skip those classes and spend the day with me.""

After that I tried to talk with her about it, her expectations and how self centered these demands are (imo). She then left the bed and slept on the couch, since then we dont talk anymore.

Am I wrong for thinking that her behavior is really ungrateful and inappropriate?",relationship_advice
t3_dlhuug,He Pretended the Proposal was a Joke incase I was rejecting him.,"So 2 years ago my SO(27M) at the time Proposed to me(30F)
It was my Birthday, we were sitting on our bed just chatting and he pulls out a ring and asks.
I said Yes, followed by lots of excitment/shock and said something along the lines of ""omg really?"" In a happy way not a condescending way if that makes sense.

He then turns around and says the entire proposal was a joke.
He starts saying things like ""do you really think I'd propose to you with a crappy ring like that?"" And ""If this was a real proposal I would've put in more effort, not just done it at home"" etc etc etc.

Cue me getting absolutely furious and heartbroken all at once. The Proposal/Ring was my Birthday gift, he hadn't gotten me anything else or done anything that day.
He then bursts into tears and explains that His anxiety took over, he thought I was going to say no so he started saying all these things to protect himself. He does have a LONG history of anxiety, which I completely understand. He can get overwhelmed just going out in public as he feels people are judging him.

I just honestly don't know how to move past those memories of what he said.
I barely wear my ring as whenever I look at it all the memories come flooding back and I feel sick.
I feel like it's tarnished my Birthday too, its just such a horrible thing to remember each and every year.
Part of me understands the anxiety he had, the other part thinks WTH you put in zero effort then sabotaged it, is that all I'm really worth to you?? 

He wants to get Married, and he's quite excited and happy to plan things and look towards our Future.

t3_dlnnrc,I need help I can't breath,"I have no idea who to talk to about this. I don't even know if I can at all.

The father of my daughter and me had a rough patch, fighting nonstop, him calling me names and just generally having issues. We recently had a few conversations and we decided to make things better. I really thought we were and I was happier.


I feel sick writing this. I don't want to spell it out or think, I just found out two hours ago but I just don't know where to go. I can't think straight.

We live together with my parents, us upstairs them downstairs.

My now ex boyfriend worked on our car outside at night and my mother brought him some food out. Later she came back out and apparently he hugged her in a none decent way, kissing her neck and then putting his hands on her back underneath her clothes. He tried to kiss her. She was frozen before but when he tried to kiss her, I might puke holy shit, she pushed him away and left. For the last two and a half weeks she approached him repeatedly trying to talk how this was inappropriate and what the fuck he was thinking. Apparently this happened before some time where he hugged her and she felt it was too close? Not a friendly hug but more close and intimate and she just left immediately. Thinking he felt down or explaining it somehow in her head. After that last incident she couldn't anymore. She was crying. She was convinced that it was somehow her fault. She tried talking with him which he avoided. 


She talked to him today while taking a walk with our daughter while I was still working. My daughter is 1 year old so she doesn't understand. No worries about that. 

Anyway she kept asking for an explanation and he kept saying it wasn't her fault but not saying anything else than he just wants to forget it. 


She told me today. She said she doesn't understand why he didn't talk to me first because she told him that she will talk to me about it. He didn't. I was shocked. Speechless. My heart was beating and racing so fast I thought it would trip. 


I went upstairs and told him to leave
He seemed absolutely awful and sad but not surprised. I kept asking him for what happened and all he could say under tears was that he has no clue how it all lead to it, why one thing led to another while they were in the garage but it somehow did and he was sorry and he doesn't know what to do. 


He left. I feel like puking. I don't know what to do. There is no relationship anymore. I broke up with him obviously. He kept saying that it wasn't only him, he said she hugged him first and kissed his cheek and said that it wasn't in an only friend's way. 


What the actual fuck. 


I knew something was up but never would have guessed that.

I never would have thought he would cheat he loves his daughter to bits, we really did make an effort he kept repeating he loves me. He wish she never came outside. I just don't know what to do. Please help..

I don't doubt my mother. She is a Saint she helps so much and she would never lie about that. It's just hard to hear and I honestly wish she was lying.

I don't know what to do... My daughter is sleeping next to me and all I want is to run away.


In one way I wish he would be by my side now and hold me, how fucked up is that. I wish this is all a dream a shit dream that I wake up from. Please let this be a dream.",relationship_advice
t3_dld53s,"I (28f), a new home owner, am thinking about breaking up with my low-income boyfriend (26m)","Ever since I bought a new home, the relationship between my partner and I has taken a nosedive. I have a stable job and decent income, which my partner of 3 years has always called attention to. Whenever he wanted me to pay for something,  my partner would often say to me, ""you earn 4x more than I do, you can afford it."" I have paid over half of our rental fees in every rental we have lived in, even though he could afford it if he wanted to. This has been a touchy issue in our relationship, and looking back, I feel like I have been manipulated into paying more than my fair share. He also often brings up the point of being ""egalitarian"" with expenses, but I would like to save for myself.

In our last rental, my partner paid $600 while I paid $800 for rent PLUS utilities. For my new mortgage, I will be paying $2500 a month,  which would be affordable to me on my own, but it would almost match my budget - I'd barely have anything to save. My partner, who doesn't know what he wants to do career wise (he says he wants to be a climate change advocate for his dream job, and truly thinks it's okay to pursue a passion job instead of make a decent income) just took a job that pays $1000 a month through Americorps (this is a one year contracted position). It's a supervisor position, which he says will come in handy later in order to apply for  ""dream job,"" whatever that is. He also has a side gig that helps him earn $75 a month. My partner wants to only pay $600 rent, no utilities, while living in my 3 bedroom house.

So, I got a roommate, which my partner is still deeply opposed to. I needed to save money to pay for home repairs. All I asked my partner to do was to pay $700, a flat rent amount for my house, no utilities, and he freaked out and said I was sucking him dry. He said that his monthly budget would be $950 if I charged him $700 rent - $150 of this budget being misc. expenses. He has $3000-$5000 saved in his bank account. He also dog sits occasionally and receives money from that. I don't understand why he can't even pay me a decent roommate rental fee. 

Another thing is, because I now have an asset, I brought up the possibility of a prenup if we ever got married. My partner also freaked out to this, and said that only non-trusting couples get prenups. 

Am I a terrible human being for wanting my partner to pay $700 for rent? He says I'm greedy, but am I? I love some qualities about him, but not how he views our financial differences.

Update: Many of you have posted concerns about  my financial decision with the house, and I want to let everyone know that it's not like I would go into debt if I live in it on my own. I could afford this home, entirely on my own. I would like to fix up this house and make it personal, so I do want more saved up for that reason.

Second update: He agreed, before I bought this house, that if I bought a house, he would live with me and pay $700 rent. He knew I was going to buy a house. He still ended up taking a lower paying job anyway, and now he want to lower the rent. There was a verbal agreement, and I shared the process with him every step of the way.",relationship_advice

t3_dlr2b7,Is it bad/petty to refuse to date a coworker solely because they are a single mother?,"I originally posted this in the AITA sub but it got removed by the mods, so I‚Äôm reposting here hoping for a further discussion. The few people who were able to comment on my post in AITA said I was not TA but I want a bit more insight.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So there‚Äôs this coworker of mines that seems to be very interested in me. I say seems because she is overly cheery and playful/flirty with EVERYONE but recently she‚Äôs been overly flirty and suggestive with me‚Äîto the point where others around the office are jokingly calling us a couple already.

The thing is...she‚Äôs a single mother and that is something that‚Äôs a hard stopper for me relationship-wise. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing against her, her past, what she has/hasn‚Äôt done in life and it has nothing to do with her. It‚Äôs nothing like that. In fact, she‚Äôs someone whom I genuinely want to remain very good friends with and be part of my life. It‚Äôs purely a personal choice; it‚Äôs part of my criteria for what I‚Äôm looking for in a partner. Much like how some people won‚Äôt date others who are taller than them, or from a different religion, etc..

I personally just don‚Äôt find it fair that if I was to get in a relationship with her I‚Äôd essentially have to ‚Äúshare‚Äù her with her ex, her lawyers, and her child. (Her ex is a deadbeat who doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with her or the child but her parents are helping fund the legal battles so she is constantly in and out of court and speaking/seeing him.) I also don‚Äôt want the child to be accustomed to having a father-figure/male role model in their life only to be disappointed if the relation doesn‚Äôt work out. It really wouldn‚Äôt be fair for that child, and I would feel horrible if I had to disappoint them or something. Plus, at this point in my life I just really, really, don‚Äôt want any children, even biological ones.

It‚Äôs been a tiring past week and a half or so having to change the conversation if anything even remotely having to do with relationships, romance, or sex comes up (which is often because she always brings those things up in a flirtatious manner when speaking to me) or having to find a reason to leave the room if we end up alone together. And it really doesn‚Äôt help that other coworkers are constantly egging and teasing us to ‚Äúmake it official already‚Äù.

I‚Äôm essentially just ignoring the situation hoping it goes away but I know that‚Äôs not the best way to handle it but I also don‚Äôt have the heart to tell her the truth and possible hurt her feelings especially seeing how genuinely excited and happy she seems just talking to me.

So tell it to me straight Reddit: how best should I handle this and, IATA?",relationship_advice
t3_dlmofm,My (M23) gf (F21) is moving into a flat with at least 3 other guys without telling me anything,"This is a throw away for obvious reason I just forgot to add the tag on the account name, sorry for that. Anyways, this has been upsetting me for quite some time so I would love to her your thoughts.

So my gf and I have been together for a little bit over a year. We've had a long distance relationship and would see each other about once or twice every two months for a weekend and for the holidays. Now she is moving to a town about an hour away from where I live to study there. This is where the problem starts. 

She is going move into a university accommodation, which she will share with 4 other people who already live there. Yesterday she went to check out the flat (even though she already agreed to move in no matter what) and it turns out that she is going to move in with at least 3 other guys maybe even 4. While she was there I was texting her asking how it was and who her flatmates were. She took a long time to reply and then said that she had met 3 of them and they were all very nice but she didn't tell me anything about their sex. I expected the flats to be separated by gender so I didn't even worry about it. But then later when I asked her in person she told me, that she'd be living with at least 3 guys. I was really shocked by that because I honestly was not expecting it. I told her that I didn't really like the idea of her living with a bunch of dudes but she just ignored my concerns and told me she would take the flat because it's cheap. 

It's not like I don't trust my gf or anything but she has always been really good with guys and tends to quickly become friends with them. She's pretty decent looking, into video games, likes sports and is pretty much drama free which seems to be attractive to a lot of guys. When we started talking about her moving closer to me we agreed to see each other every weekend with mostly her coming to my place because it's cheaper (her uni pays for a part of the commute) but while we talked yesterday she also said that it's probably best for her to only come by every second weekend or so, so she can ""bond"" with her flatmates and get to know people at uni.

So I think what I'm trying to say is that I'm pretty sure she won't stay faithful to me, she's always had a lot of male friends and when she used to live further away there were times where she would go out with other male friends and not even bother telling me in advance or just say ""hey I'll be going out today"" and not even mention the sex!

So how can I tell her about my feelings and maybe persuade her to move into a different flat. Or should I just call it and break up with her before she cheats on me?",relationship_advice

t3_dl02bm,"My mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, I need advice","So I will try and keep this short.

I have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced I chose to live with her, I have always trusted her and so on.

Now we have never been rich, but we got by, I have always worked since I could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

Now because of this I quickly started saving my money, pretty much, I would usually save up at least half of what I made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when I moved out and such.

So I turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so I wanted to see how much I had saved.

Well you can see where this is going, I looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so I freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""Some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so I yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. She started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. I know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, I mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. My dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

Well this was 2 weeks ago, I have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

In the meantime I have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

Now here is what I said, untill I have every penny back I wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do I doubt I will ever forgive her. I need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",relationship_advice
t3_dlrgsn,How can I(18M) Assure My My Girlfriend(18F) She Can Come Over Any Time She Wants To My Place,"So I‚Äôll begin by giving some backstory. Me and my girlfriend both attend the same university and she lives on campus housing and I have my own place close by (not on campus). She spends the weekdays on campus housing but weekends at my place or back home at her parents places. 

I always make sure to make it clear to her than she can come by anytime. When she comes over she always tries to help around, just last weekend when I came home she had washed my bed and folded everything for me. I let her use my washing machine and dryer because why waste money every time on the campus one, but I didn‚Äôt except her to wash my things for me. She also uses my kitchen to cook something and she always asks me first if she can use it, even when I‚Äôve made it clear that she can. And every time she makes something in the kitchen she always tries to make something I like instead of choosing herself. A couple weeks ago she made some food and immediately told me to try it before she ate it herself. So I kind of had a feeling that she felt bad that I was letting her do all this. 

Just this past Sunday when my girlfriend was leaving to go back to campus. She asked me if I can come over during the week and stay with her overnight since it gets dark really early these days and campus is pretty dead at night. So I went over to her place and spent the night last night and don‚Äôt get me wrong, campus housing is not that bad, but it‚Äôs still really small. She was however really happy. So we were just laying in bed cuddling and I asked her if she wanted to spend tonight at my place instead. 

She said she didn‚Äôt want to and I asked her why. From there she explained she felt bad that I was doing so much for her and she wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me (not true at all, she does so much for me) and she didn‚Äôt want me to think she was taking me for granted. I felt so bad when I heard that because she does so much for me and she‚Äôs so caring of me. I told her and assured her that that was not the case and I love having her come over to my place. 

What can I do to assure her that she can come to my place anytime and especially with it being close to winter, I don‚Äôt mind her coming over. In fact, I want her to come over more. How do I make it clear she owes me nothing in return and her just being there is the best thing in the world.

t3_dlqyy7,The light of my life is gone.,"I‚Äôm 25 (m) she‚Äôs 21 (f)

We have been together almost 2 years. 

Sunday afternoon she said she needed time to think if she‚Äôs happy. She claims I have done nothing wrong. I asked when she will be back. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be a day, week or month. I asked if we were still together and we would remain loyal and no dating or anything of the sorts. She agreed. She left and I was in agony. I felt like the world was collapsing in. I got a text the next day while I was at work saying she was at the apartment. I rushed home and held her. We get to talking asking about if things have improved. She told me she went to a friends house, and then to a co workers house. (She has no close friends). She got drunk at the co workers house and slept with him. I find out and lose it. We eventually calm down and I say that I‚Äôm willing to forgive her and if she‚Äôs willing to go to couples therapy. She agreed instantly and we just held each other. 

Today as I woke up and finding some therapy locations she came out and said that she‚Äôs still not sure if she‚Äôs happy. She said we have (had) a perfect life with perfect pets, location etc. but she‚Äôs not happy where she is. I then told her what do we do? After lots of talking she is unsure if she still loves me and wants to take time to think about it. In 2 weeks she‚Äôs going to let me know if she still has feelings and if I do. 

Right now I have feelings and want to get back together. But my brain tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm scared alone and living with a friend at the moment. Any advice is welcome. 

I‚Äôve never wanted to hurt myself until today and I don‚Äôt know how to process it.",relationship_advice
t3_dlrcfd,My fianc√© [25M] has a blood type that is impossible based on his parents blood types. I [25F] am the only one who knows this.,"This happened within the last two weeks. Title says it all. I‚Äôm a geneticist, and my fianc√© was recently interested in what his blood type was. His parents are avid donors so I told him to ask what theirs was and I could give him an idea of what his would be. They both sent pictures of their donor cards with their blood types on it. I did a punnet square and give him 2 outcomes. Wanting to know for sure, he had the doctor type him at his most recent appointment. The blood type the doctor gave him is impossible based on his parents. To double check, I made a date day of giving and we went to give blood together and while we were they I asked them to type us and give us cards, same blood type as the doctor gave him.


Being a geneticist, I have always been an advocate of doing 23andMe for the health reports. Three years ago when we got together, I did mine For a class, and being that we‚Äôve talked about kids more recently, I told my fianc√© he should do one too. He is cool with it and excited to see the reports. His mom has always talked about how she isn‚Äôt sure of her ancestry so I mentioned we got him one and asked if she wanted to order as well and she was very against it because she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant the government to have her data‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm not sure if she is aware of something and doesn‚Äôt want anyone finding out, or if she truly feels that way. She didn‚Äôt seem to know that blood types are able to be figured out by genetics. The whole 23andMe thing happened slightly before the blood typing, and his sample has been submitted so we‚Äôre waiting on the results.


When my fianc√© asked why he didn‚Äôt have the types I told him he would have, I simply told him that I messed up and crossed them the wrong way (he doesn‚Äôt know how to do the squares so he shrugged it off and went about his day)


Now I‚Äôm in quite a pickle with what to do. I‚Äôve stumbled upon business that clearly isn‚Äôt mine to know. However, if I ever found out that my fianc√© knew something like this and didn‚Äôt tell me I would feel so betrayed. He submitted his 23andMe sample already and now I‚Äôm at a crossroad of what to do because while it‚Äôs unlikely, it‚Äôs possible that relatives may come back on his report and they won‚Äôt be people he knows.


At this point I feel I only have a couple options and none of them sound great.

-talk to his mom first since she would know most about it, and let her talk to him

-talk to him first and let him approach his parents about it

-don‚Äôt tell him at all and risk a relative of his that he doesn‚Äôt know showing up on 23andMe, and also letting him continue to falsely assume he knows his (genetic) family medical history as we venture down the path of children and growing old


Any insight would be appreciated. My last resort is not telling him. It‚Äôs making me sick to hide this from him, and I know if this were reversed and I were to find out, I would feel like everyone im closest to is suddenly hard to trust.


EDIT: wanted to add that I have known his family for 10 years and we are extremely close. My relationship with his family is as important to me as my relationship with him, and I am afraid if I harm my relationship with his family, it will affect us, and vise versa.


TLDR; fianc√©s blood type isn‚Äôt possible based on his parents blood types. I‚Äôm the only one who knows this based on genetics. 23andMe sample was submitted before this info was stumbled upon, and were waiting on results of 23andMe. At a crossroads of what to do with this info as relatives he may not know could show up and he will wonder why. I don‚Äôt want to hide this from him for the rest of our lives",relationship_advice

t3_dlqmmd,My (32F) daughter (14F) is unmotivated and doesn't seem to care about her grades,"I'm hoping to find some people that are currently going through this with their teens, or perhaps were like this themselves in high school.

My daughter just started her freshman year of high school. To provide some background, she's always struggled in math and science. However, she still made an effort to do her schoolwork. However, I started noticing in middle school, she started slacking on doing homework. It got to the point where she didn't do it at all, and would lie and say she did. Of course I then found out when her teachers and or counselor told me. It got so bad that she was going to be held back in 7th grade (but did not due to me changing her schools). I figured a lot of this contributed to the private school she was in (NOT a good school), the unhealthy relationship with her dad (emotionally abusive) and not enough support on her dad's side. I took her full time and her dad only saw her on weekends. 7th grade her grades went back up.

Right when she started 8th grade, I got a job opportunity in Oregon and my daughter was all about moving. We love it up here, and my daughter flourished in 8th grade. Now, she's in 9th, and she has an F in all classes except two easy ones. I don't know what to do at this point. A part of me wants to punish her and take her phone / laptop away, but I feel like this won't get to the root of the cause. I'm thinking of bringing her to a specialist to see if there is a learning disability at play. I've seen her do homework and she cannot stay focused. She never seems concerned that she has missing homework or assignments. That is her major problem...she doesn't get things done on time and as she gets older, I feel like she needs to be held accountable for her actions or lack thereof. She doesn't seem to understand failing her classes will lead to summer school, and then if she fails that, leading to being held back. She will come home and I'll ask if she's done her homework and she lies and says yes.

Also, to add insult to injury, my daughter has three, yes THREE academic support classes. One to help with math, one is study hall, and one  helps with all subjects. It baffles my mind how she is still doing so badly. Socially she is great, we haven't had any major issues up here. She just wants to be on Tumblr and Discord chatting with her friends and not doing work. I'm hoping I can get some honest genuine advice on here! I don't want to be a tyrant parent but I don't really know what to do anymore.

t3_dlshts,"I [m/29] just recently dealt with some indiscretions via snapchat with my girlfriend [f/28], and I just found out more information regarding the ordeal, having already decided to forgive her, and now i'm so lost and don't know what to do.","So a couple of months ago, I found out my girlfriend had sent a few nudes to  a guy on snapchat. I immediately broke it off, and in the ensuing days, she sent me a couple of like novel length emails regarding like, figuring out what it was about her that made her able to do something like that.  I won't get into details about that, but I'm a pretty objective person, and I showed the emails to my sister and a couple of friends of both genders, and they were on the same page with me that she genuinely wants to be a better person, and is disgusted with what she was able to do. Due to the emails, and knowing her past and how it came into play, I decided to try to move past it, because I thought the long run would be worth it. There as some family stuff, and past relationship stuff that I factored in as well, and I really thought (think?) that she is a different person now.

We're in a long distance relationship, and it was also a factor to me because we hadn't gotten to the discussion about moving, and i told her if this was gonna continue she needed to move in a few month, which wasn't gonna be an easy thing to do, but she agreed, so i really thought highly of that as well. Basically that was a long winded way of saying that I genuinely have very little doubt about her ability and willingness to change.

Now the problem has come up where I found out that it wasn't just nudes, it was like, sexual conversations, videos, etc etc. As much as I like to think I would be a bigger person and br forthcoming about the fact that there were more than just nudes if I was in her situation, I think that I would have kept it to myself as well. Not in the least of which because I kind of made it very clear that had there been more, this would have been over with no discussion about. I regret saying that now because I dunno if she would have told me, but that's done now. Based on the emails she sent when we broke up, she was pretty devastated when it all happened, and was willing to basically do anything to make us work, so I'm trying not to factor in the fact that she didn't tell there was more, because I essentially told it would be a poison pill if i found out more, so I guess it's not that surprising that she didn't tell me.

Now the problem is that I don't know what to do. My gut instinct was to end it, and I did. this was a few hours ago. But I saw myself with this girl for the rest of my life, and we're amazing together and have so much in common, and she appreciates things about me that nobody ever has.  I know this all sounds pathetic given what happened in the beginning of our relationship, but it just had to be said. I do think those things I just mentioned are true, while also at the same time her not being able to control her urges. Not justifying, but just explaining, I guess. I'm also not blind to the fact that she did not respect me, or our relationship. She has basically said everything i could ever need her to say to make me feel like she's apologetic, devastated. sincere, etc etc etc.

As you can imagine, I'm also fucking devastated. I was devastated before when it was only nudes. Now knowing it was more, I'm 10x more crushed. I can't even explain the pain I'm in. But if I was willing to look past the nudes, is it worth it to look past like, a bit more, for the sake of the rest of my life? If I genuinely think she is a different person, and I was willing to take a chance on her, how much more is too much? Obviously anything physical is too much, and I'm not still sure about that yet, but I'm just hoping for the best right now. I really am on the fence about it. part of me knows she doesn't deserve it, and the disrespect she showed for our relationship should be unforgivable. But part of me knows that aside from this, and especially now, we are amazing. It doesn't help that I'm 29 and have been single for 10 years and haven't met anyone I really wanted to be with, and as sad as it is for me to say, my future is also on the line as well. I know that's a pathetic reason to even consider, but it's there, and I'm also writing this because I'm a bit pathetic, so I get it. But say I'm still single in 8 years, will I look back and think like, you could look past the nudes but the sexting was too much, and now look where you are...still single. If I thought she wasn't sincerely a different person, and wanting to change, I wouldn't be writing this. But I do think that, based on the pages and pages she wrote about the conversations she had with her friends and family about this, and why she was this way, and how she let it happen, and what has to change to make sure she never does this again, etc. It was just a lot.

I'm looking for an objective opinion on like, what I was able to forgive, given the circumstances, vs it being a bit more come to find out. I know most of you will even say dump them over the initial snapchat thing, I understand that, but please try to look past that, because given everything I've told you, I was able to forgive that. If you're able to ignore your gut response of ""dump her"" and just consider that I'm trying to figure out where my moral line is while also considering my life, and her ability to change, and weighing that against the fact that what i was initially able to forgive, has turned out to be slightly more, and whether or not that's something I can forgive....while also not being a doormat. Because I really don't know. Part of me says don't be a doormat, and part of me says people have come back from worse, and I can make it work and have a happy life with her.

It hurts so much writing this, but I hope to get some perspective. Especially if you've forgiven someone over maybe even more severe indiscretions, and it worked out for you.

Thanks

So he's been with his girlfriend for the past 4 months, and recently moved in with her (about a month ago). 

They seemed pretty happy, everybody was a fan of her, and i never really heard any complaints from him about her.

So, fast forward to last saturday. 

Our hometown isn't the best for nightlife, so he decided to come visit me for his 21st birthday night out,

as i live in a big city. His girlfriend decided not to come with him, and stayed at home.

We had a good night out on the saturday, celebrated well, and he went home in the morning on sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

When he got home, he'd found out that she had gone out drinking in our home town that night. He also felt that something was off with her.

He later found a condom wrapper on the stairs in their house, and asked her about it. She said that her and her friends were just messing about

blowing them up. He didn't see it as out of the ordinary so he just ignored it.

So later on that evening, she came in in tears and confessed to him that she had brought back another guy to their house and slept with him.

He called me and explained everything that happened, and told me that he was going to stay with her ""because she isn't good at hiding her emotions,

so if she was upset about it, she was being genuine"" (talking about her crying). He told me he wasn't as upset as he thought he would be, as he already

didn't trust her.

He says he's going to try work things out with her, as she was more upset than he was about it.

&amp;#x200B;

How can i convince him that what she did was wrong, and that she will be capable of doing it again if he just forgives her.

Everything started out normal when we started dating. After about 3 months, I noticed that he would not initiate and we were having sex less and less.  I finally addressed this after about a year of dating and let him know that I was not ok with this. He told me that he was just stressed about work (he was laid off at the time) but he would focus on making things right. More time passed, and nothing changed. We would only have sex once a year. I know I am partly responsible because I allowed the behavior to continue, but I was always promised that he would make things right and I did fall in love. It was hard for me to leave. The relationship was great other than this issue. We decided to get married despite my worries about his intimacy issues. He promised to go to therapy which we did for a year, and promised that he was dedicated to me and our life together. I felt we got nowhere with therapy.  More time came and went and I just got complacent with the situation.  By now we have gone 6 years without any sexual contact. Threats of divorce gave way to another round of therapy with a Sex Therapist. Again, we got nowhere.  By this time he is working more than ever running his own business, and now the business is stressing him out. More time passed. After begging for attention, crying myself to sleep for several years, and now being 7 years since we had sex......I cheated.  It was an affair that only lasted for a couple months. Husband found out by going through my text messages that I thought I deleted. I never denied the affair and confessed to everything.

She told me it was Andrew and that she reached out to him because he‚Äôs going through some personal issues she heard about and wanted to offer support and apparently Andrew said he needed the support and that‚Äôs why she had been talking to him so much. I accepted this and let it go. The next day i was heading to lunch and I noticed my girlfriend and Andrew were alone eating lunch together. This made me uncomfortable so I told my girlfriend and asked that if that was to happen again could she please tell me so that I don‚Äôt just walk in on that because it really made me uncomfortable and she basically said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and that was the end of that. For the next few days I noticed they were still always texting and he would call but she‚Äôd never answer it around me (I‚Äôm not sure if she does when I‚Äôm not around) but I didn‚Äôt say anything. However tonight I was working the night shift and Andrew and my girlfriend both had the day off. I was walking out to my car because I left some work papers in their and I happened to see my girlfriend and Andrew both sitting in his car parked in the back of the lot. I had no idea she was even near work and she definitely didn‚Äôt tell me she was with Andrew. She saw me and gave a little wave and I walked over and just said ‚ÄúI had no idea you were here‚Äù and then told her we needed to talk. She came in and found me to talk (about 15 minutes later so obviously she finished talking to Andrew) and I told her that I was hurt she wouldn‚Äôt tell me and I don‚Äôt like them doing something like that. I didn‚Äôt get an apology but she said she was hurt that I wouldn‚Äôt trust her and I have nothing to worry about so I told her I‚Äôm not accusing you of cheating I‚Äôm just saying what you‚Äôre doing makes me uncomfortable and I‚Äôm pretty sure Andrew knows what he‚Äôs doing because that‚Äôs not normal behavior with someone who you know is in a relationship. She left and went home and I‚Äôm torn because I would never think she would ever cheat on me but you know the saying ‚Äúif it walks like a duck and talks like a duck....‚Äù I also have noticed that she never answers my FaceTime calls when she‚Äôs home now and this is pure speculation but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs already talking to Andrew. Just tonight I called her once at 10 and she declined it immediately and texted me saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with my brother‚Äù so I said can you call me when you‚Äôre done and she said ‚Äúyes‚Äù it‚Äôs now 45 minutes later and she immediately declines the call again and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still talking to my brother‚Äù. The jealous part of me thinks she‚Äôs already on FaceTime with Andrew but I have no way of knowing. Anyway my question is am I overreacting and how should I proceed from this point. I really do love her and I‚Äôd hate to throw this relationship away over this especially because I don‚Äôt know if anything is even going on. Any advice is much appreciated.",relationship_advice

t3_dlpg9r,[29/F] My Boyfriend (27/M) Mom is Dying and He's Pushing Me Away and Making Bad Choices,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, but really only together for 1 as his job requires him to travel and he will be back for about 2 months and gone for another 2. We have lived together about half the time but I did get my own apartment in the Seattle where I work as I5 is a nightmare. He owns a home in Tacoma about a 45 minute drive away. However this is very serious, long term committed relationship with each other, and we see other as much as possible when he is home and not away for work.

About a year ago his Mom got diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. I am very close to her, and his family, including spending time with each of them even when he's away for work. We have also done family vacations, and this has been hard on all of us including me. She is getting very close to the end now, and he has started up some behaviors that were problems in the relationship before but had stopped for about half a year now. The first time is he hid behaviors from me when was around when we first started dating a year and a half ago. I found out that he does like a bi-annual or more ""Fear and Loathing"" type drug escapade with a good friend of his from work where they get basically ""anything they can get their hands on"" as far as drugs, and go to random cities and just burn it down. 

I first found out about it from looking at his phone, he didn't tell me. This first time it was not snooping just was on his phone looking up a restaurant, as mine was dead and the texts came through while he was using the bathroom. I casually asked about when he came out, and didn't think much of it at first as he has a good job, owns a home, has his finances in order. He just told me he was embarrassed, and that's why he never brought it up to me.

But as things got more serious with us, he was planning another trip and this time just outright confessed it to me, saying he didn't want to engage in this any more. I told him I agreed, and it wasn't healthy or productive. He said he would stop and tell his friend he did this with that he was done, but that he would like to still be friends with that person. He said he wanted me and his friend to meet and for them to have a low key weekend together, and just go out to dinner/have beers/catch up. Normal stuff.

Well, we went out to dinner and I knew something was up. His friend was acting sketchy and making excuses about how he really needed to leave dinner and ""borrow"" my boyfriend's car at dinner. When I asked my boyfriend about this, he made excuses. So, again but this time purposely, I looked at his phone. The first tab that was open was ""How to delete text messages on Iphone."" Then some texts on deleted threads about them obviously communicating with a drug dealer. 

So he had lied to me about it, and was planning on doing it behind my back. We had a big fight about it and he just seemed to fail to realize it was less about the drugs themselves, just that he was lying and sneaking around to me. He promised he would stop and begged for another chance to try to be honest. I gave it to him. We made plans for dinner the next night and he no showed. I called him and he sounded ""out of it"" and that ""he didn't realize what time it was and was sorry."" So, assuming he was on drugs, I drove to his house like a crazy person and parked down the street. I came in the house and found pills/powder/beers all over the coffee table and him and friend passed out in the living room at 6 pm. I lost it, he promised he'd stop, begged me to give him one more chance. I agreed, because I loved him and he promised he'd get therapy or try to work on himself and why he feels the need to do this and lie about it. He says he's had problems lying his whole life and wanted to find out why he can't just be honest with those close to him. He got called back to work three weeks later and never started therapy.

Fast forward to a few months later and things are going well in general, other than his mother getting progressively worse. He powered off his phone and left it by the front door after a date night though last weekend, which I knew was odd because he always sleeps it with on the charger next to him when we go to bed. I was still up and watching a movie so I thought, I am just going to see what is going on. I powered up his phone and all these texts came through on deleted threads. He'd been actively planning another trip with said friend, where they were just going to go to Portland next weekend and find a drug dealer and piss themselves away on ""whatever they can get their hands on.""  (There was also a text message from his ex-girlfriend where he had  asked her out for a beer the night before, and she responded at 12:30 am.) 

Obviously I lost it and threw him out. He didn't even try to defend it this time. His Mom is literally days away from dying and he's acting like this. Jeopardizing not only a loving and long term relationship with me, but his own health and safety. The next day I went to his place to pick up a few of my things and we talked again and because I was chalking this up to him grieving and acting out, and was still open to giving him a chance to work on this and not engage in this behavior.

He however was not, saying he needs to decide what he wants, a relationship or if he just wants to be alone. He says he's not sure if he wants kids, and doesn't want to lead me on but he knows he will be lonely without me. I told him fear of being lonely is not a good enough reason to stay in a relationship. He then said that he wants to travel the world (so do I?) This statement is all so wild because yes, I do want kids, but have NEVER pressured him about this, and will not have kids out of wed-lock. I see that as a conversation to be had if we get engaged, which I am also in no hurry for, and maybe 2-3 years down the road. (I am in no place nor desire children right now, actively focused on my career.)

I think he's just going besides himself with grief and making a lot of bad decisions and making up weird excuses in this ""grief fog"" but also, he's done this behavior before, and don't want to make excuses for him. Also for context, I've been very supportive influence in his life, pushing him to better himself and put himself out there in his career and he has. I encouraged networking events and he's been promoted and is so much more confident then when we first met. I'm close to his family and also have their support in this and they don't condone his behavior and are planning on ""talking with him"" and told me ""to take care of me"". I'm attractive, driven, and have a great career so will not have trouble moving on, and all my friends say I should and don't understand why I even gave him another chance previously. They says I can do so much better, but I genuinely love and care for him and who he is. I am not sure what do here. 

Do I move on, or should I give him patience and support and understand he is just acting out and not behaving rationally at this time? I cannot be okay with him going on this drug binge and wonder if him just breaking things off is his way of doing this. Any thoughts, insights, advice is appreciated on how to handle this.

TL;DR: Serious long-term boyfriend's Mom is days away from dying of cancer. Now he wants to do a bunch of drugs, and is reaching out ex-girlfriends and pushing me away. Help.",relationship_advice

t3_dlgsva,"A guy (M19) that I‚Äôm with told me (F19) that I look like lil tecca - an ugly rapper, and I don‚Äôt know how to react.","

Okay so for context I‚Äôm a 19 year old black girl. For the better part of my younger teenage years, I would spend a lot of time on reddit/4chan and other edgy internet places; it goes without saying that these places are not kind to black women(or women in general). And though i know a lot of it just jokes i was pretty impacted by the significant amount of men that just weren‚Äôt attracted to black women because of what they had experienced. They would stereotype and berate their looks and appearances a lot; this depressed me. Couple that with the fact that during this time, a lot of guys that I was friends with (and even ones I didn‚Äôt know and wasn‚Äôt interested in) would feel the need to tell me that they didn‚Äôt like black women; swell. I hated my skin at this point and wanted to be white so badly. 
Fast forward to 2018 and 2019 when now it‚Äôs  essentially cool to be black. Of course, guys are now a little mature and for the first time in my life I‚Äôm starting to question how ugly I really am, as attractive men are starting to be interested in me. (Of course on reddit I‚Äôm still a 5/10 tho). I‚Äôm starting to feel more confident but still have issues with self image and hold myself back from pursuing the men I want because I‚Äôm scared they won‚Äôt like black women or find black skin ugly. 
But as of like two months ago I met a guy. He‚Äôs white hispanic but exclusively like ethnic (mostly black) women. We click; but not just because we find each other attractive but our personalities are compatible. He tells me I‚Äôm cute and praises my looks and shushes any attempts at me to deny his praise. I gas him up just as much because I get that men need that type of stuff because unfortunately they don‚Äôt get it enough. 
Yesterday we were talking, and he told me I look like lil tecca, a 16 year old rapper. The reason why this kid is a meme is unfortunately because he‚Äôs [‚Äúugly‚Äù](https://imgur.com/a/xBorBKd)
This guy that I‚Äôve been talking to just went on and on about how I look like him and he found it VERY funny. Like he just kept on laughing and laughing and saying that it was uncanny. I was wondering if it was a joke the whole time, because he‚Äôs a very very sensitive anxious conscious guy and this seemed left field for him; but he wasn‚Äôt kidding and he meant it. Honest to god that shit hurt to hear; especially coming from this guy that I‚Äôm REALLY into. Like I know he finds me attractive and everything, but hearing this really made me question that and feel really insecure. I didn‚Äôt tell him this, but I‚Äôm sure he got the sense that I wasn‚Äôt really into his ‚Äújoke‚Äù because he started to back track and say ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt look THAT much like him‚Äù 

I told my best friend (who is his best friend too) about this and he lost it too, so I‚Äôm starting to fucking thing, do I look like him? I‚Äôm so confused right now and kinda sad and hurt. I don‚Äôt want to be that emotional bitch, but really I feel bad about this. I know that both of these guys find me attractive so there‚Äôs a lot of cognitive dissonance going on right now. 

Should I brush it off and pretend that it‚Äôs a funny joke and not let him  know I was hurt by it? Or should I confront him?
Should I grow a thicker skin? 


For the record; as I am  very sensitive  I am also conscious and empathetic. I would NEVER tell someone that they looked like an ugly celebrity to their face even if we were close. Mostly because I wouldn‚Äôt want someone to do that to me. I know the detrimental effects little comments have on self esteem and worth. 

Also because I KNOW everyone wants to see me, here: 

https://imgur.com/a/3pvzqjj


TLDR: a guy that I‚Äôm pretty much dating told me I look like little tecca and wouldn‚Äôt stop denying it/laughing about it. I‚Äôm sad, because little tecca is ugly as shit, and I‚Äôm insecure about being black and in attractive. Should I express my feelings to the guy about how his joke made me feel bad, even though I KNOW for a fact he finds me beautiful?

t3_dlqn8r,My (20F) boyfriend (21M) crossed a sex boundary of mine and he doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm so upset,"I feel insecure about my body, I think I have some sort of dysphoria. I know I‚Äôm stick skinny but for some reason, I don‚Äôt feel like it. I have a different idea of how my body looks and then if I see a picture of myself, I‚Äôm surprised that that‚Äôs how I really look. It‚Äôs weird. So I know that‚Äôs why I have this issue but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get over it. 

I like having sex in dim light or the dark. No lights on, one candle by the bed is ideal. And I like being under the covers. That‚Äôs pretty much my only ‚Äúquirk‚Äù my boyfriend was fine with it and respected it and never complained. And we can see enough with the candle light, it‚Äôs perfect in my opinion. It‚Äôs sexy and romantic and kind of shadowy which is good since honestly genitals aren‚Äôt very aesthetically pleasing so the low light helps blur things and it‚Äôs easier to look at lol. I also say that I don‚Äôt want him to look at me while I give him a blow job. I will sometimes look up at him to make sure but I want him to be looking up or somewhere else. Honestly I just feel awkward and ugly and gross and I try to do a good job and I don‚Äôt wanna be worried about how I look, I just wanna focus on my task so I‚Äôd rather he doesn‚Äôt look at me while I don‚Äôt look pretty. I think it‚Äôs a reasonable request like I don‚Äôt want him to see me choking on him and having drool all over and my face looking dumb. 

Last night I was ‚Äúservicing‚Äù him and I looked up and he was looking at me. So I stopped and told him that I told him not to look at me when I‚Äôm doing that. He was annoyed and said I was being dramatic and that I look fine. He just wasn‚Äôt understanding. It got me frustrated so we kind of argued. 

I don‚Äôt like fighting with my boyfriend but that‚Äôs what happened. He‚Äôs still mad at me today. I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs gonna break up with me and I don‚Äôt want him to. So can someone just tell me if I‚Äôm insane and making crazy demands? I don‚Äôt think so, I think he should have respected my wishes while I was doing that for him.

t3_dlp8uo,My boss (28M) said something that makes it clear he respects our brand new (21M) employee over me (29F),"I've been working at this company for about 8 months. I was hired into a position that was directly relevant to my experience and education, and I've been doing a good job, my boss tells me that often. 


We just hired a new guy to help out on our team. I think he's smart and a pretty good worker, I have no issues with him at all. He was given the same job title as me despite never working before/an unrelated education but whatever, again, I didn't really care.

We have another girl on our team who does administrative functions and to be honest, she is very bad at it. My boss gave up completely on managing her because she is tough to work with, and passed it on to me as a clear test to see if I'm deserving of a promotion, which he told me he will help me work towards.


Anyway, today, it became clear that she still sucks at her job despite my best attempts at managing her. He understands that it's just how difficult she is to work with and said it doesn't reflect on my efforts, and he was saying she may just need to go. He said we might not need her anymore because the new guy can take on the work that I'm doing, and I could take on all of her administrative work, and only keep a tiny bit of what I'm doing.

I said I like what I'm doing, and that the administrative stuff didn't particularly interest me, and he said ""oh yeah we can figure something out."" I messaged him later, proposing a way of splitting up some of her tasks between me and the new guy, and he responded **""I think we need to use new guys brain more, not sure I see the value in him doing that or that its the best for him.""**


So I guess he sees the value in me doing all the admin stuff then? Like I don't want to act like I am above it but I've worked 8 years to get to where I am in my career and it was absolutely not in my job description to do any of that. I'm always happy to help out short term, but it seems like he is now only seeing me as a glorified admin.


Meanwhile, new guy is doing pretty good for someone brand new on the job but my boss doesn't see how much I am working directly with new guy to walk him through things, answer questions, provide guidance, etc. 


To be honest, it feels sexist that he would say that. I know that I am great at my job, everyone tells me, including my boss, so why else would he say a brand new guys brain is better suited for the more challenging work that I'm doing, that my boss knows that I like, and that I'm excelling at.


I'm so upset about this that I don't know how to address it. If he only wants me to do admin stuff then I will quit, I took a leave of absense from my old job and have no problem going back there, I loved this job except for my bosses anger issues (the whole team gets it) and now this.

t3_dl66x5,I (29f) never thought I'd be right where I am today. I need some kind words,"Throwaway because I know my ex-husband and his wife are both on reddit. not sure about this sub but wanted to be safe.

A little backstory: My husband and I divorced 3+ years ago. He left me for another woman, whom he married very shortly after our divorce was finalized.

I'm the first to admit that our marriage was over long before she came around but I can't help but hate her. We were married young. I was 18 and he was 19. He was in the military. Once he got out, I think we were both different people who had grown apart. Suffice it to say, I got pregnant with our first child in 2013 and our second in 2015. We fought constantly, I demanded that he sleep in the guest room. He was always working supporting our family and looking back, I took him foregranted. He did his best to support us and I didn't treat him like the husband he deserved to be. We were essentially roommates raising two kids and the environment we were raising them in was pretty volatile. Even if we did try counseling, I'm not it would have helped.

Since he abruptly left, he has been an active part of their lives. He never missed a child support payment and sees them per the terms of our custody agreement, which is every other weekend and alternating holidays. He also gets them for several weeks each summer.

The kids love their time at their dads and love their step mom as well. They talk about their time there very positively and I'm happy for that. I'm happy that they have a warm environment, a ton of toys, cute clothes, opportunities to see the world, all with 2 people who seem to genuinely prioritize their marriage and love one another.

What I struggle with is I feel like I've been robbed. I look at their life and compare it to my own. I see a woman who my husband left me for. She's tall, beautiful, has the best clothes, has a successful career and loves my kids. It seems like the two of them have the happy, positive relationship I yearned for with my husband at the time. I'm jealous and I'm angry. For christ sake, even their 2 dogs are adorable and perfect

More so than that, I've struggled since he left to provide financially and I can't take them on fancy vacations and all of the things my ex and his new wife are able to do.  I only have 1 income and it's modest. Both of their careers have taken off in the past few years and seem to be doing well for themselves.

Every time I pull up to drop off the kids, I see their massive, beautiful home (I've been inside and it's immaculate). They both drive new bmws. They go on 3 or 4 vacations a year that are anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks (sometimes the kids come, sometimes they don't). Every time, it's inevitable for me to see pictures of them and the kids in Europe, South America, the Caribbean, and wherever else. It hurts because I feel like the woman in those pictures should be me. I hate this woman with every fiber of my being for taking my husband away from me but at the same time, respect her for welcoming 2 my babies into her life and treating them as her own. I still want to stab her though.

Very recently, after picking up my kids from a weekend at dads, they were so excited to tell me that their step mom is pregnant with twins and they were going to have not one, but two new brothers or sisters. I felt like I was just punched in the stomach. All of the feelings I experienced when my ex-husband left the first time came back. The flood gates opened and once I got home, I bawled my eyes out.

It's been 3 years since we split up. I should be over this. I shouldn't have these feelings but just don't know how to stop feeling the way I do. I wish therapy was an option but I just can't afford, even with insurance. My family listens but I know I'm probably a broken record at this point. Also, I have no one to blame but myself for letting my marriage spin out of control like it did. How do you rectify that? Any kind words or advice would be appreciated.

 **FOLLOW UP:** Wow. I wasn't expecting such a huge response to this post. Thank you everyone for your comments--good, back and ugly. The internet can serve as a reality check sometimes. Having complete strangers say some things that I needed to hear is cathartic. It's different when it comes from unbiased strangers. So, thank you, kind and not-so kind people.

Everyone is right. The choices I made with my ex husband are in the past. What I need to move past and find for myself what he has. I hate how the two of them got together. Just to clarify, he DID have an affair with her. It lasted about a month before she gave him an ultimatum. Me or her. He chose her. Take it for what it's worth, he isn't a one night stand kind of guy. They were colleagues who worked in different firms, struck up a friendship that ultimately led them where they are today. I believe him that it wasn't something that went on for months. In fact, I met her once months before their affair. It was at an industry function that I attended with my husband at the time. He introduced me to her and I remember thinking she was radiant, funny and personable. The two of them interacted very little that night. She was with her date who I'm not sure if she was dating but nonetheless, she was someone I even thought I could be friends with. Boy, how wrong was I? That was nearly 5 years ago. In my state, you have to be legally separated for 1 year before a divorce can be finalized. The whole thing did a number on my self esteem, identity and position in life. What compounded all of this is I see them constantly. Especially her. My ex commutes about an hour to and from work and she works right around the corner from her house. So, it's always her there on Friday afternoon when I drop off the kids. Every Friday it's the same. She opens the door and has perfect hair, a cute outfit and high heels that probably cost me a months rent. If I'm being honest, though, they're perfect for each other. The way my kids talk about how daddy treats \[step mom\] and \[step mom\] treats daddy make me happy that they see such a strong marriage and good example of how two people should love and respect each other within a marriage.

Some of my friends are friends with some of their friends and I've been put in my place when venting about them. One of my best friends who often says the things I don't want to hear told me, ""you know, you aren't her. you didn't meet your husband when you were 28 and had things figured out and knew who you were and what you wanted. you learned and are at where you are now because of trial and unfortunately, error.""

I believe I do a good job at shielding my kids from these emotions. They don't hear me speak ill of either my ex-husband or their step mom. From what I understand, the two of them reciprocate that respect. We have a simple life and despite pretty much always being in 2 households (my oldest wasn't even 2 when my ex left), they are pretty well adjusted.

All in all, today serves as my first day in truly trying to compartmentalize and move on from the mistakes of my past. I'm taking some of your advice and am going to seek out affordable therapists who perhaps operate on a sliding scale. It'll be hard and not without it's fair share of recurring feelings, but I feel empowered after reading all the things you all wrote. It's to get back on the proverbial horse and build the life I want rather than rue in the life I lost. Thank you from the bottom of my heart--even the guy (AGalaxyOfMyOwn) who compared me to his ex-wife.",relationship_advice
t3_dlr0px,I (27 M) have been seeing this woman (23) for about a month now and she seems to have a weird connection with her friend...,"Obviously it's tough to give appropriate advice if one cannot see things from a truly objective view. Right now I just want to know if I am reading too much into this. 

So about a week after we first started seeing each other, she confessed that she was still in contact with this guy that she used to have a pretty big thing for. At this point I should mentioned that I never asked, she volunteered this information. Anyway, I was a little uneasy at first until I heard that he lives on the other side of the country. During this discussion she also explained that they had never actually dated, she was just into him. They remained friends and her crush on him fizzled out. 

Fast forward to today, her and I had just woken up from a nap and we were just chatting and lazing out in bed, she was going through her snapchat memories. All of the sudden a picture of her and him pops up...and then another, and another. Maybe 8 in total. In all of them they were getting pretty close with each other, as in not typically the kind of close you get with someone who is ""just a friend"". Obviously they were old pictures, but I went ahead and asked her about it anyway. ""I thought you and X never dated?"" to which she replied ""yeah we never OFFICIALLY dated"", She got pretty nervous at me asking too... At this point a little red flag went up. To me they obviously were more than just friends, and the fact that she was seemingly trying to downplay the nature of their relationship while maintaining contact with him raises an eyebrow for sure.

Does this seem weird? Am I reading into it too much? We are still pretty young in our relationship and we don't know each other that well so its hard to make a judgement call.",relationship_advice

When I want to go somewhere he gets pissed and tell me I‚Äôm wasting our money, but manage to guilt trip me in buying him unnecessary things like 4K TV, thousand dollar computer, video games, car stuff....etc, that cost me over 5grand in the past half a year. I don‚Äôt know what to do and just work and come home to our room and hang out in my corner.

Edit: My boyfriend had a decent job that pays $25/hr when I met him but was laid off, not even half a year into the relationship because the factory closed. He worked there since he was 18 for 8 almost 9years, and start a little above minimum wage. However, when he goes out to find work, no job will give him over $15/hr because he only have a GED. So he gone through a string of jobs that pays between $12/hr to $15/hr, without any benefits and quit every single one in about a month....",relationship_advice

t3_dlokql,I (30M) am lost in a loveless relationship with my (31F) wife and don‚Äôt know what to do.,"My wife follows this sub, I‚Äôll be as specific as I can without getting into too much identifying detail.

I (30 M) have been with my wife (31 F) for five years now. I knew that when I got with my wife, she had a very traumatic childhood and bad family relationships. I have also had a traumatic childhood and do not have relationships with my immediate family members. We definitely bonded over this shared pain when we first got together.

I have some concerns about our relationship which has been tumultuous to say the least that have come to a head. 

She has been sick our whole relationship. I don‚Äôt know at this point if it is real or not. I want to believe her, but there are certain things that make me doubt her. At first she was sick with a chronic auto-immune disease. Then that morphed into other auto-immune diseases. She did see a doctor for these, but when the doctor would not prescribe her pain killers she usually got so upset felt that she wasn‚Äôt being believed and never went back. I do know that patients with ‚Äúinvisible illnesses‚Äù are often treated like they are drug seeking by doctors and are disregarded.  Lately she has refused to see the doctor for anything, citing her past treatment as the reason. Her family also has a history of these illnesses, so I don‚Äôt really know what to do or believe. 

Because of her illness, she hasn‚Äôt had a job for the majority of our relationship. I have been the sole provider, working 2-3 jobs to support us. She refuses to apply for disability support, as she was denied on the basis of her physical illness. She also has a long documented history of mental illness, which she would qualify for, but she still refuses to apply. I‚Äôve suggested she find a way to work from home, even part time, even for minimum wage as it would help tremendously. She has made no effort in this regard either. Usually when I bring it up, she gets very upset and ends the conversation.

She does the majority of the housework and requires constant recognition and praise for what she does. I‚Äôm sure that not working affects her self esteem and I do my best to constantly thank and praise her. I appreciate this about her, but I am not so observant after working 60-90 hours a week and often fail to thank her. This tends to start fights, and I feel resentful of having to constantly thank her when I work myself to the bone and never expect a thank you back.

When we first got together, she didn‚Äôt have any interests in my friend group. I tried to introduce her to them. She either criticized them, got jealous, or pushed me to abandon my friendships. She avoids spending any time with my family that I do have. She is often suddenly not feeling well enough to see them when they do visit, leaving me to either cancel or awkwardly cover for her. As a result of my complicity, I don‚Äôt have many friends left. The few I do have, I speak to in secret as she is often very jealous of them and gets upset when I spend any time with them. 

She and I get into fights often. My tone seems to upset her a lot and is usually a reason for the argument to begin with. I often don‚Äôt mean anything by my tone. I‚Äôm just generally burnt out and tired so I can sound short without meaning it. When we get into fights she often tells me I‚Äôm abusive and threatens to leave me. I know I have a unsecured attachment style from my childhood abuse and it triggers me to hear things like this. I have been in therapy for over three years to address this, but I feel the tumultuous nature of our relationship gets in the way of progress I‚Äôm trying to make.  

I have been someone I don‚Äôt often like in our relationship. I have had bad relationships before her, and I‚Äôve never fought this much with anyone. I often just take all the blame for any fights we have and apologize for things that aren‚Äôt my fault just to keep the peace. This has caused me to become resentful and bitter. I know this is my own doing, but I feel lost on how to deal with it in any other way. She is able to stay mad at me for weeks, unless I take full ownership of any problem and apologize over and over. If I bring up something that she has done that hurts me, she is either annoyed that my feelings are hurt or disregards them completely because of something I have done that negates my feelings entirely. I almost never feel heard or validated. 

I have tried different styles of dealing with her, but that usually requires me to always be calm, clear with my boundaries, and non-reactive to whatever she throws at me. I can‚Äôt always do this, even when I try my best. 

Our love life has been non-existent for a while. She often rejects any affection I try and show her, so I have stopped trying.

I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I don‚Äôt have a support network, other than my therapist. I feel too guilty leaving her, because I am the one with a job and a way to make money. She doesn‚Äôt have family to lean on and often says she would go to a shelter if we broke up. The idea of that makes me feel awful. I don‚Äôt want to abandon my sick wife who I do love, despite all of this. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is a bit scattered. I haven‚Äôt really opened up about all of this before and I‚Äôm trying to articulate what is wrong the best I can. I just feel like I‚Äôm constantly swimming against the current and drowning and I don‚Äôt know what I should do.  Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqofw,My (28m) gf (27f) wanted a break. What should I do?,"I've been with my gf the last 3 years. We've talked about marriage, and starting a family in a couple of years.  

Today she told me that she has changed in the last 3 years, and that she didn't know what she really wants right now. She says she loves me but she is not sure if as a couple or only as a friend.  

We agreed to take a two weeks break and to meet  then to talk about the future, and to discuss what being a couple really means to each one of us. Both of us can send only one message to the other in that time, and that message will not be replied.  

I really love her, and I want to be with her. My plan is radio silence this 2 weeks, and use this time to ponder how I've changed the last 3 years, and how can we continue to change (as is natural to everyone) in the future, but together.  

Any advice? Anything else I should do or think in this time?

t3_dlsplb,"Am I right to be annoyed that my girlfriend (of well over two years) didn't invite me ,as a plus one, to her friend's wedding?","So me and my girlfreind have been dating for over 2 years and 6 months. We've lived together for over a year.

For further context, she is not from of my country (where we live), so quite a bit of money has been spent in order to obtain a visa for her to stay here.

To the question at hand; her friend recently had a 'destination' wedding - which is actually closer to my country than to the happy couple's. My girlfriend went alone to the wedding, not even asking if I would like to come. Maybe I'm just being entitled, but it's not like we've been dating for two months or something. We've been dating quite a long time, living together, and I've paid quite a bit of money in order for her to stay here.

I mean, fair enough if this was just a small wedding with few close friends and family, but from pictures I saw, there were babies, toddlers, and all sorts.

I feel like to a certain extent she's embarrassed by me, and my inability to speak her, and her friends, native language.

Am I in the wrong? Just being overly dramatic?",relationship_advice
t3_dlsohq,"My (30f) long-simmering anger towards my close friend‚Äôs (28f) husband (31m) boiled over before I had time to address it in a calmer manner. It, uh... didn‚Äôt go well. What do I do? What do I even want?","Warning: long-ass post. 

I‚Äôve written a version of this a million times. I have known for a few years it wasn‚Äôt going to end well, but I didn‚Äôt imagine it would go this way. I‚Äôve tried to shorten this as much as I could, but a long story is a long story. Throwaway because everyone involved reddits so let‚Äôs throw the dice.

I met Carrie (28f) in college and we became part of a close friend group. She met her now-husband David (31m) two years later, and we all became easy friends. Years and states and lots of road trips have gone by for all of us.

There‚Äôs a lot of backstory I could give but I‚Äôll try to simplify it as much as possible. David has changed over the past ten years. He always had some mental health issues (as many of our group do), but now he uses them like a weapon. Temper tantrums and sniping, overwhelming negativity and ranting and spiraling over the slightest disappointment. Rudeness and total obliviousness to others‚Äô feelings or circumstances. 

It‚Äôs not like I have no sympathy as I suffer from mental health issues too, but he has had so many opportunities to get help, so much support, and he refuses to utilize any of it, and instead projects his unhappiness until everyone else is miserable too. I have felt uneasy for awhile about Carrie and David‚Äôs relationship because sometimes they treat each other with such casual cruelty, but other than being there for her when she is hurt I‚Äôve tried to let their marriage be their business.

I‚Äôve been becoming more and more fed up with his behavior lately, especially since I recently introduced Carrie and David to my oldest and dearest friends, Diane (31f) and Matt (32m). They love Carrie, but don‚Äôt appreciate David‚Äôs attitude towards themselves or his own wife. He‚Äôs become so intolerably childish and rude and selfish that I get stomach aches at the thought of having to be around him from secondhand embarrassment. I‚Äôve been trying to think of how to approach it without losing Carrie.

There‚Äôs some additional backstory here. Two months ago, my best friend of 20 years‚Äô mother, Diane‚Äôs mom, a second mother to me, committed suicide in a particularly horrific way. The suicide is awful enough, but the way she did it and what she said is what tears me apart. I‚Äôve definitely been more emotional and quicker to anger since it happened, though I‚Äôm okay most of the time. 

Since then, I find I can no longer tolerate him. Partially due to his behavior after I told him about it. But fair or not, I cannot stand the sight of him or endure the emotional burden of his behavior and the responsibility of making Carrie feel better. I‚Äôve realized that I actually view his behavior as emotionally abusive, and that I didn‚Äôt view it as such before because he is not the typical aggressive abuser. He is manipulative through his sadness and his tantrums and passive aggressiveness. 

Carrie is responsible for maintaining his friendships (her friendships, really) and mending fences when he‚Äôs crossed a line. She‚Äôs not allowed to see her friends (me and others) by herself unless he‚Äôs out of town, because he‚Äôll make sure she knows that she is responsible for him feeling terrible and left out, because he won‚Äôt put any effort into creating and maintaining friendships himself. He won‚Äôt put any effort at all into even pretending to interact with her parents, even though they‚Äôve been nothing but welcoming and Carrie has told him over and over how important it is that he at least pretends to enjoy interacting with them occasionally (I‚Äôve witnessed this, so it‚Äôs not just Carrie bitching).

She‚Äôll make emotional bids and try to involve him in things that make her happy or that she is excited about, and he‚Äôll just keep staring at his phone and say something noncommittal or even outright negative, and she deflates. I know that he uses the silent treatment to punish her. I know that he flies into a whiny rage when she doesn‚Äôt read his mind.

On top of that, I don‚Äôt know the details but something is fishy financially. She talks about her independence being the reason they don‚Äôt have a joint account, but she asks him for permission to spend money and I know that a savings account exists that they both contribute to, and if it‚Äôs not in both their names...

But I am not entirely altruistic. I hate the way he treats her, but I also hate being around him. So I resolved to write Carrie a letter trying to explain things in a more levelheaded way than I actually felt, and perhaps give room for a tiny friendship again one day, even if I could no longer be around her husband.

I wrote a few drafts of the letter. They were all pretty angry and I was trying to tone it down because Diane is not responsible for his behavior and shouldn‚Äôt have to bear the burden of the shame he doesn‚Äôt seem to feel. She isn‚Äôt his mother. I had reached a pretty good draft two weeks ago, but before I could refine it and send it out... 

I can‚Äôt help but selfishly plead my case that on top of Diane‚Äôs mother‚Äôs suicide, I have also been dealing with some really stressful and scary health issues and financial issues over the last two months, as well as a non-stop two weeks of disasters at work. 

Carrie knew all of this when, two weeks ago, we‚Äôd been talking on the phone for about twenty minutes while I talked about how awful things had been, especially that day, and she said, verbatim, ‚Äúnot to make your shitty night even shittier...‚Äù and said David thought I‚Äôd been avoiding him lately and they wanted to know what was going on. I was annoyed she had to do his dirty work again. I didn‚Äôt want to lie to her ‚Äúface.‚Äù I was angry and stressed and already ranting, and I did exactly what I was afraid I would do and the very reason I started writing that letter... I ranted at her about everything awful about him. I don‚Äôt even remember all of it, but I know Carrie was in tears by the end of it and that we haven‚Äôt talked since. I‚Äôve split apart our gaming group and I‚Äôve probably lost three friends in a single night.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt deserve it. I didn‚Äôt blame Carrie for David‚Äôs behavior, and that, at least, I can say for certainty I said more than once during my rant. But it was angrier and crueler than it needed to be. I‚Äôm sad. But mostly I feel relieved.

I know I should reach out, it‚Äôs ten years of friendship... but I find myself not wanting to? I‚Äôm tired right now. I‚Äôm so, so tired. I don‚Äôt want to take care of her feelings and I don‚Äôt even want to take care of my own. I don‚Äôt feel sorry for what I said, only the way I said it. I don‚Äôt want to bend over backwards to ‚Äúmake things right.‚Äù But I know I‚Äôll regret this in the future. I feel like maybe this is my last and only chance to tell her that I think he‚Äôs emotionally abusive. I have so many feelings and none of them are sorted out, other than the relief. 

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before? What do I do here?

Maybe this is more ranting than anything but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Some people have said to meet her in person but I know she‚Äôll cry and I‚Äôll want to cave and make things better but I desperately don‚Äôt want to. My life is better without him and I would‚Äôve done it years ago if not for Carrie. Maybe I just have to say goodbye but I don‚Äôt want that either. 

Is losing friendships just part of getting older?

Sorry for the long text in advance. I think details were needed to try and give all side of the story.

So my entire life I never really had a relationship it was more of hooking up with girls and just letting my lust take over and frankly I was completely fine with that. In the middle of the year I transfer to go to a different college and I went on tinder to do my thing and I met a chick who I found really amusing and she came over that night( I was just expecting the regular Netflix and chill) but she stop me and said she wanted to get to know me more because she was fond of me and didn't wanna mess that up. I thought about it and I agreed and we just watch a movie,made jokes and cuddle and for the first time ever in my life something felt like it was pouring out like there was an emotion that I had been neglecting this entire time. However, I always think logical and I knew it was the endorphins and dopamine flowing through me essentially ""love"" but I liked it so for the first time in my life I gave this girl a chance. 3 to 4 weeks go by and she's practically over at my house every other day we have dates and we're making it work and that 4th week she ask me if we can be together and that she's crazy about me and has never felt like this about anyone before and I go ahead and agreed and we start going on but the logical side of my mind had been catching patterns that she was aware of that I was observing for example her phone was on do not disturb all the time, she was constantly looking at her apple watch and depending what she looked at her phone would affect her mood.

Being the curious human being that I am I have her come over on the same week we started dating I wait for her to fall asleep and I go through her phone and I find out that she's still talking to guys she met on tinder or had a thing with some conversations where plain but others more complex like the next day she left my house after we became a thing she texted a guy and wanted to know where she stand with him because she made her really happy and she was getting mixed signals but my friends the story doesn't end there I keep quiet and I keep monitoring the conversation for about 2 weeks building enough evidence to break up with her. The cherry on top is that I fell asleep early one night and she texted a guy who she had a thing asking what was he up to because she went over to ""friends"" house and he fell asleep early so now she's bored and then I found another one and she was talking to a guy and how the guy was saying that he enjoys hanging out with her and having her over and that it sucks that she's always ""busy"". So at this point I build my report she leaves my house the next day and then I called her that night telling to explain the story and I get put on voicemail right away and I thought it was odd so I called again and she picks up with a dry tone ""hey I'm doing hw I'll call you when I'm done beep.."" I couldn't even get an ok out through my end because she hung up fast so I go on snapchat and check her location and she's not home so at this point I'm pretty piss off, I get a call from her 2 hours later saying ""hey baby what's up sorry I was busy but now I can talk to you"" then i proceed to tell her everything i know and tell her it's over and she explodes she starts screaming and crying says that she doesn't know what I'm talking about then she start threatening to kill herself so i decided to have her come over. I was truly a gentleman never made malicious comments and kept it civil so she could talk and I could hear her out.

She tells me that some of the guys are truly friends and the other ones she did have something on the pass with them but nothing has ever happened when we started talking or going out but regardless I let her know how she greeted me with a dry tone and how this wasn't her behavior and she try to explain to me that she was talking a friend out of committing suicide and that's why she was upset but I found a loop on her story and made her explain to me the situation one more time it the loop was that she was upset when she was talking to him but the order that she explained it was I called her first and then her friend called her explaining his situation so I stated the mistake in her story and how she was lying and she started crying again and we talked some more so I gave her an ultimatum on 3 conditions 1. If I find out she was lying to me about this or I found out anything from here on out we would be done 2. Things wouldn't be the same right away and that my trust was broken so it was gonna take time to heal 3. I needed some space to clear my mind(5 days was the total) she agreed and we cuddle and went to sleep and I thought that I made the right choice but deep down I knew that this wasn't over because the tea was just simmering.

 

So now that we're half way caught up after the whole scenario we have a week without seeing each other just to give some space and relax but ofcourse we talk on the phone and message each other and she tells me how much she loves me and that she wishes that she could see me soon. Next week comes by and I reflected and thought about and it and I really wanted to settled down and try to make it work so I did just that I tried my best without worrying about anything else and its was amazing we would laugh together,cuddle go out and I try my best to Express my affection to her but it's quite difficult when you're always seem as cold hearted and you're trying to Express emotion that's never been there before but she understood and work with it and she seems happy so 3 weeks go by and everything is going well and I honestly think this is gonna work out and...... PAUSE I need to rewind the clock back to the first week i first met her and we ask each other why we were using tinder and she told me she had broken up with her boyfriend let's call him ""Johnny"" about a month ago and that they went out for a couple months and she was just trying to find someone who would treat her right.....CONTINUE on the present we talked about the plans for the weekend and how we should go out and then possibly go out to a club after our date so the week before she comes over as usual.

However, I notice her notification are on do not disturb again so I start pondering but just give it a rest because it's just gonna drive me up the wall so she comes over Friday night we watch a movie but someone keeps calling her nonstop that night and she explains is her friend that has depression the one that was gonna kill himself and I just give her and ok and tell her she can talk to him if she wants and that I don't mind but she replies with I only care about being with you atm. Saturday morning I wake up with a bad case of strept and it bloom out of nowhere so I spend Saturday completely bed written and I told her I was probably gonna go to the ER and have it checked out and that it was better that she went back home so she doesn't get sick. She shrugs my comment off and says that shes gonna be there for me on every step of the way and that theres other place that she rather be and she truly showed me that she cared the entire day she was always giving me a cold water keeping track on my next dose of medicine and she was trying to keep my fever under control and I felt pretty lucky.

Furthermore, my condition only got worse and we end it up going to the ER and we were there all night and the doctors where taking there time but I was going in and out Basically out of it and I would glance at her from my hospital bed and my right hand side and I can see in my peripheral that she was texting and then about 2 hours in the ER her phone started buzzing but she would hang up right away and she was thinking I didn't notice. So I get treated and they have me stay over until I get better so in the morning I tell her to get some breakfast in the cafeteria and call her mom because she wants to talk to her so she leaves to do that and I get up and grab her watch and go through her messages and my intuition was right Johny her ex had out of thin air come back on her messages and some messages she said where ""I'm going laundry rn but we can talk"" or ""after this class is over we can hang out"" and he's replies where "" oh you shouldn't go out of your way for me"" &amp; ("" yes hanging out with you is always the best"") and the night before she came over that weekend she send him a message around 12am to come over and ""hang out"" and he agreed and the convo she had with him with the time I was sick and she was taking care of me was "" I was gonna spend the weekend a friends house but now he got strept and I'm stuck taking care of him and I got all cute to go and out and have fun and now I'm stuck and bored"" and he replied "" oh well that sucks but hey that's what friends are for and he's pretty lucky to have you as a friend"" and then they talked about their day and then at midnight she send him a text saying"" guess where we are now?"" And that's where it ended and he didn't reply the only other thing I found was the suicidal kid let's call him max and he was Basically blowing her up on how he couldn't live without her and that he enjoys spending time with her and she makes him feels special but he wants to know why she hasn't given him an answer if they should give them a chance and she replies with I'm gonna be over at a friends house this weekend so I'll text you when I'm back. At this moment in time my blood is steaming and im ready to blow but I calm myself and wait it out, she comes back and I act like nothing happened I tell her she should go home and finish hw because tomorrow is Monday and she agrees and leaves to meet up with a classmate to go over the notes and tells me they're gonna study next to the library by the dorms.

Me not believing her bs lie I weight and check her snapchat location and she nowhere near the campus and then 2 hours goes by then she leaves and goes to a location near campus and stays there for about an hour then she comes back home and she calls me saying the study session went great and that she came back little more than 2 hours ago I tell her that I'll probably discharge tomorrow(Monday) and that I should be making a full recovery I tell her goodnight and the conversation ends and then I'm on ig just scrolling and watching videos when I get a snap from her so I reply saying ""yea time to get some sleep"" and she replies saying she's getting ready for bed and that I should go to sleep as well but I wait then I check her location again and she's driving to the same place where her ex lives and about an hour go by and I guess she sees that I'm on ig so she sends me a message that I should get some rest then I start poking the bear and telling her she should too and then she tells me shes making music and I really start getting aggravated and really pint point her on her bs and she tells me she's at her friends house and that they're just vibing and making music I stop replying to her and and she just keeps texting its nothing else but at this point I ignore her. The next day I get discharged from the hospital and I check her snap and find out that she turn off her location and then I get a call from her later on that day but I don't answer and ignore her text and then I let her know that I got released from the hospital and that the drugs and lack of sleep caught to me and I'll I done is nap all day and that I'll talk to her tomorrow.

Here we are loosing a night of sleep over this bs just trying to get myself back together on how I'm gonna confront her on this but honestly I think I made up my mind she may have showed the sweetest actions towards me but they didn't mean anything and I don't think it's worth keeping this going. I really need clarity on how to approach this because I was just thinking in ghosting her and not talking to her at all because right now I am furious and at disbelief but hey at least I finally understand why all my friends go back to their exes after I tell them they're gonna get hurt again. If you have any questions feel free to ask I'll try to answer as soon as possible. Tbh I honestly thought it was gonna work out I showed her that I would do anything for her but that's clearly was not enough and don't worry I'm not the type to go back for a third try, I think I disintegrated any feelings that I had toward her over the weekend.

t3_dlr3cs,Getting over being cheated on,"My ex (20F) and I (20M) were dating for 2 years, and it's been about 8 months since we've broken up. We broke up because she cheated on me, lied about it, and I had to drag the truth out of her (she was ""trickle truthing""). We go to the same college and had a lot of friends in common. I've pretty much removed myself from her friend group and have no desire to see her, but she still wishes that we could be friends and wants to give it a chance. I've reduced it to pretty much 0 communication between me and her, but it still hurts to think about everything that happened. One of my best friends (we'll call him Sam, I've known him from before college and he goes here too) has still been friends with her, and it's just weird knowing that they still have a connection. I told him that he could do whatever he wanted regarding their friendship, but I guess I still expected he'd cut it off as that's what I would do. I recently found out they still hang out, and he invited the both of us to a small party recently and I didn't go just because I knew she would be there. I want to be able to live my life at college without being afraid of seeing this girl around and not thinking that my friends aren't loyal to me.

Everything still hurts and it sucks because finding out they are still tight was just a setback for me in terms of recovering. I feel like I deserve more loyalty from Sam, but is it fair to ask that they don't be friends? Is there anything I can do to speed up getting over that relationship or is time/patience the only way?

t3_dls8xv,My (22m) best friend (f23) is obsessed with being in a relationship,"So I met my best friend from school and found out that she had gotten out of a 1year relationship. They ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù earlier this year. I say ‚ÄúBroke up‚Äù because they kept having toxic conversations for several months after accompanied by her begging for him back. After she finally accepted to move on she has been nonstop trying to find someone else which consists of her depending on dating apps. She goes head of heels for guys that she is into and is very open and seemingly comfortable from the start, doing things that people do in relationships that have been established for a long time. It is to the point where her life is revolving around finding a guy. She explained to me that she‚Äôs only happy when she is with someone and that she cannot not be in a relationship. The guys that she has had things with have not lasted for more than a month. She has also gone back on some of the things she said for the sake of meeting someone. For example, ‚ÄúI do not want to meet someone from X place.‚Äù And then she starts to consider meeting somewhere from X place. I know its okay to take it back, but I think she is only doing it because she wants to be in a relationship badly. I also know that if she wanted to be in a relationship badly she would choose any guy that is down. She is a bit picky but as stated before when she finds someone who is interested in her as much as she is interested in them, she goes head over heels and that is all she talks about. I have tried to give her advice and outlooks on things and she has listened but she feels that she is so ready to jump into love again that she sometimes tends to ignore some red flags or deem them as ‚Äúnot that bad‚Äù if she is really into the guy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she has gotten a lot better and I know that in the end, the only person that can help her is herself.  But I still think she might need some more help and different perspectives.",relationship_advice
t3_dls8aa,Boyfriend‚Äôs friends are rude and inconsiderate.,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 7 years, around 2 years into our relationship he met 2 of his now closest friends. Every week we would all meet up and go to a Trivia event. We‚Äôve always all hung out and it‚Äôs been a good time and never issues or awkwardness. This past year, one of his friends got a new girlfriend. We all decided to take a vacation together. I learned really quick how the new girlfriend was. Before we went on the trip she would make snide comments about how we were younger than them and little things like that. Long story short, the time we were on our trip was a nightmare. Every time we suggested something she wouldn‚Äôt want to do it and it was her way or the high way. I realized my boyfriends friend who is dating hers demeanor did a 180. He barley spoke to me and when he did it was after she said something to me. She is quite a bit older than me so I don‚Äôt know if it is an insecurity issue or what. After we went on our trip they barely contacted him anymore. Keep in mind, on our trip we weren‚Äôt afraid to tell her when he weren‚Äôt interested in something. I think she was bothered that we don‚Äôt let her control everything. Long story short my boyfriend is too sweet and quiet to express how he is feeling about it all. Well tonight we all met for dinner and we‚Äôre going to do a Halloween thing as couples and after dinner we all agreed on getting froyo. We drove all the way to the froyo to only have them text us that they were gonna get some alcohol and just meet us there. Keep in mind that we drive almost an hour to hangout with them and they NEVER offer to drive to us. After they texted that, my boyfriend got so upset like I‚Äôve never seen him. He said that‚Äôs it we‚Äôre leaving I‚Äôm done with them doing things like this. I need help on whether or not I should say something to them. I know my boyfriend will sugarcoat it if they ask, and I want them to know. I truly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his friends, I think it‚Äôs the new girlfriend. Do I say something or do I let him?!

We sleep together but aren‚Äôt intimate. I‚Äôve tried to talk to him but he literally ignores me. He says it‚Äôs him not me that he‚Äôs not interested in sex but I know it‚Äôs a lie as he admitted he masturbates. So I lost a massive amount of weight, changed my look and I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm nice to look at. But nothing matters. If I talk to him in bed he goes to sleep. When he comes home from work he generally goes straight to his computer and I sit in our bedroom. The house is disgusting. I do my best but I‚Äôve not got help and I have a chronic illness that makes things hard. I go out every day for my mental health but he refuses to do anything unless he wants to. He won‚Äôt sit and talk to me or go out anywhere with me. He won‚Äôt decorate (he‚Äôs amazing at it) if he does the job is never completed. The garden looks like a jungle. If he mows the lawn he leaves the tools lying. He‚Äôs had relationships with other women - not physical he says but he says he needs to talk. He won‚Äôt say why he won‚Äôt talk to me. I e done everything. I said to him I wanted to meet someone else for sex and he said he wasn‚Äôt happy with that either. When he comes to bed he goes straight to sleep. He‚Äôs been to the doctor and all is well but he refuses counselling etc so basically I have no relationship. I swear I‚Äôve done everything. BUT he‚Äôs an amazing dad and we have a grandchild now. My children are adults and worship their dad as does everyone. So if I left him, my children would never forgive me. I am out of work at the moment so I have no money. No deposit for accommodation. I have a small dog who makes my life worth living but if I went to homeless accommodation I can‚Äôt take him and I don‚Äôt trust my husband to look after him. I‚Äôm close to suicide.

t3_dls1w0,I‚Äôm worried me f(16) and my boyfriend m(16) are too shy and awkward,"So we have going out for a solid month now, and we‚Äôve reached the general landmarks. We‚Äôve held hands, kissed, talk/ hangout all the time. There‚Äôs times when talking to him (particularly over the phone or in text) are great. Convo flows and feels natural. But in person, we really don‚Äôt sync up that well and there are a lot of pauses and breaks in between communication. He‚Äôs said that he gets shy around me, and too be fair, he can be pretty social around friends. But i would say that in general he is pretty shy and doesn‚Äôt really talk to my friends or people he doesn‚Äôt know. 

This makes me wonder if i should continue to build up a relationship and wait for him to open up more, (and for me to become a little less awkward too) or if we really just don‚Äôt sync that well. That‚Äôs my worry- that though we do have interest in each other that in the end we might not just work because he is so shy. (i tend to be more extroverted.) or that as people, we just don‚Äôt connected much deeper than attraction.

Any advice?

t3_dloy4f,"I (32M) called my GF (28F) selfish in a fight recently, and she‚Äôs saying she won‚Äôt be able to forgive me for this and it seems like we‚Äôre about to break up because of it.","Backstory: We‚Äôve been dating for almost 5 years, lived with each other for 4. We both recently graduated college and she‚Äôs trying to get her career started. Her job is the definition of a toxic workplace and has been in this role for about a year now. Not enough support, outrageous demands, ridiculous schedule (she‚Äôs been working about 70+ hours a week recently). Well she comes home stressed pretty regularly and likes to vent for a long time each day, which is fine and normal. I get it.

One thing i‚Äôve personally been upset about is our lack of intimacy. We haven‚Äôt had sex in over two months. She never seems to show interest or affection towards me either. She never even initiates anything (hug, kiss, sex, hand hold etc). She rarely even seems to ask me about how my day goes. I thought she was just caught up in this new job and was too stressed to really do any of that. I‚Äôm not entirely devastated by that, I get that her job is important to her and she‚Äôs doing her best and comes home completely wiped.

Well about a month ago she got a promotion that she was very excited about. I offered to take her out to lunch since we both had the day off surprisingly. Like most days, she talked my ear off for hours and hours all about herself, her job, what her boss said, what this other person said, etc. I was genuinely happy for her, but i‚Äôm starting to resent this job a bit and I feel like the stress is affecting our relationship.

We ended up going home, and some how got into an argument. I mentioned that my feelings were hurt because I felt like the conversation of the entire day(not just today tbh) was very one sided. I mentioned that she didn‚Äôt even ask me how my day went and showed literally no interest in me or anything I had to say about myself. She basically blew up when I said this and jumped down my throat saying how she‚Äôs worked so hard for this, how dare I try to take this away from her, why can I not be happy for her. I told her that wasn‚Äôt the case I just feel a little neglected in this convo and a simple ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù would have kept me at bay.

\*THE MISTAKE\* Things got so heated I dropped the line ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre being really selfish‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure what I said after that, but something along the lines of how i‚Äôm upset that she‚Äôs only talked about herself all day and showed zero interest in me. Well that was about a month ago, and it turns out this has been brewing in her mind and she just can‚Äôt believe I would ever say that. Tbh I don‚Äôt feel like I was too far off. I get it was a bit rude, but she‚Äôs treating this like I cheated on her and this is just something she‚Äôll never be able to forgive me for and our relationship will never be the same again.

How severe was what I said? I get that I made a mistake and could have communicated better, but she‚Äôs treating this like some catastrophic event she‚Äôll never be able to let go of.",relationship_advice

However, now we never call except for wake up calls before school. He is always in the mood for calling, but me on the other hand never seem to want to call anymore. Nothings changed in our relationship in fact it‚Äôs gotten much better since those rough first months. I just don‚Äôt have the will to FaceTime anymore and I feel like it‚Äôs making him even sadder than he usually is because of health problems and family issues. I just don‚Äôt want to tell him I don‚Äôt want to call because it will hurt his feelings so I make up excuses that have kept this going for a while, plus the fact that I really don‚Äôt have a reason why I don‚Äôt want to call other than just not having the energy to. so if he were to follow up my explanation with a question like that then I would be left speechless

t3_dlorcw,"My (18M) girlfriend (17F) turns 18 in two weeks. Her parents still won't let her date, leave the house by herself or do anything independently. We feel trapped.","Me and my girlfriend have been dating (in secret) for just under a year now. Her parents moved to the UK with her when she was 7 and somehow they still haven't adapted from where they came from (a pretty shady part of South Africa). They only let her attend specific clubs at specific times each week -- I met her at the ice rink I worked at as this is one of their 'trusted' locations (but only during very specific hours of the day...). Fortunately they don't check her phone so we've been able to keep a 'long distance' relationship despite her only living a \~30 min drive away.

They're showing absolutely no signs of stopping this behaviour. To add more madness to it all, they're divorced but still living together and constantly arguing. My girlfriend is desperate to escape but they pay considerable money for her clubs which she couldn't afford otherwise. They've also bought her a car to start learning to drive and of course they put a roof over her head. My parents said if she needs to she can live with us for a couple months or so but they don't want her permanently living here which is understandable as they've only met her briefly a handful of times, when picking me up etc... She has a job but it doesn't pay well enough for even the cheapest flats within our county, and I'm much too poor to share a flat with her right now. I'm still living with my parents while I finish my last year at college.

It's like torture for us both. I can't leave her, I love her too much. I assume most of my irl friends probably think I'm bullshitting or seriously over-exaggerating, but everything I've said here is completely true. They totally seem like the kinds of parents to do these things when I've seen them talking to her.

I was very up front and clear about my hatred of marriage and how I didn't want to have children. She said she understood that and that she loves me and wants to be with me. We do love each other very much and we're perfectly compatible with each other save for those two ""huge"" issues. Well the longer we're together the more I feel it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue. I believe that she'd probably stay with me even if I never popped the question and decided to not have children, but that makes me feel like I'm taking something important from her that I can never make up. I don't want to do that to her, but every time I bring up this subject she starts to break down because she says how much she loves me. On the flip side of things I also fear that if I cave and do those things I'll be miserable for the rest of my life and I've only got the one life to live so I honestly don't know what we should do. This is all made worse by her parents trying to push me into ""popping the question"" and treat me like a prop to be used to get their daughter married. I feel like there's a no win situation in this.

Edit:

After making this post, I was able to have a long heart to heart with my SO which I feel opened her eyes to exactly strongly I feel about these things. I also learned that she's on the fence about children herself, she said she's not sure if she said she wants kids because it is expected of her or if she really wants them, so there will need to be some soul searching on that front, the marriage part is a bit more problematic but she understands that it's not just because I don't want to do the paperwork. Some of you recommended that we see a couples therapist so I brought that up again and she agreed so we're going to see a councilor to make sure we can find a happy middle ground that the two of us can be happy with, and if we can't we'll go our separate ways amicably.",relationship_advice

t3_dlt354,Just need advice on whether or not what I‚Äôm feeling is okay or ridiculous.,"Me (23F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for 3 years. We‚Äôre about to embark on a long distance relationship for under a year due to my job. He is military and will be following to where I will be located. We currently live in an apartment together and I will be leaving pretty soon. He is going to a school after I leave; and right before he gets to our new location. He had asked me to take some of his things to what would be our new place. I said yes, and I honestly was really happy he came up with that idea. It gave me a sense of security because I‚Äôve always been iffy about long distance relationships. I‚Äôm also the type of person who needs to know that things are going to happen for sure and needs something physical to happen to ease my mind about the situation. For example, I‚Äôm planning a party. I talk and talk about planning it all the time but when I finally start making the arrangements to starts the party is when my mind is at ease and I know it‚Äôs for sure happening. It‚Äôs just how I am with any situation. So having some of his stuff already there put me at ease. Well, weeks later he says he changed his mind and doesn‚Äôt want me taking anything. He said this because if he has all his things, his command has no choice but to give him an apartment and not a barracks room (like a dorm room). I said okay, but I was visibly upset so he asked why. I told him why and he said it was ridiculous for me to need that sense of security. He then asked if I could put my feelings aside so that we could have a happy relationship instead of ruining it with my feelings. He kinda just continued to go off on me and basically invalidated my feelings (literally said my feelings aren‚Äôt valid) and so I brushed it off. Moving day for me came, and I asked him again if he wanted me to take anything. And he then flipped out saying ‚Äúcontinuously asking someone to do something steers them away, you know that right?‚Äù and I was taken aback because this dude will continuously ask for blow jobs when I‚Äôm not in the mood, but I‚Äôm still in the wrong then lol. So anyway, I started crying and told him that he was being insensitive. He continued to invalidate my feelings. Idk if I‚Äôm justified or if I‚Äôm being emotional and ruining what little time we have left together. Thoughts?

I have been dealing with this for a while now and I really want to get this out in the open because bottling up my feelings has been overwhelming and unhealthy. I do not have many friends to talk to about this so I hope I can get some help here. English is not my first language.

I have been dating my girlfriend for the past 6 years. I fell in love with her and I was able to be with her after a couple of years of knowing each other. It makes me happy thinking about our beginnings. We have been through a lot together and we have always stuck it out. Communication has been very important and even when we have our issues, we talked and made sure the relationship stayed strong.

About 2 years ago, my girlfriend has been developing anxiety and depression with suicidal thoughts. It took a while to get used to this, but I have tried to be a rock to her. It was difficult in the beginning but I learned on how to deal with this.I made sure I did things for her and let her know I am there for her. It hurts because I know I can't do anything else, but I have been doing my best.

Recently we moved to her father's house to save up money for a place to rent depending on how we do, but she has not been working. The mental issues have really gotten to her and she has been missing work. She has been getting prescribed medicine to help deal with this, but it has been inconsistent. She still has reoccurring episodes and it is interfering with her life. She will not move from bed and will not take care of herself. She is not cleaning up after herself and has started smoking to help deal with her issues. Since this is not my place, I do not feel comfortable anywhere else in the house except in our little space.

It does not help that I am paying for our expenses. I am decently well off and blessed with a good job, but I feel like I am carrying this relationship and it is becoming too much for me to handle. I am no longer happy with the girl i first met and it is painful to say this. I love her with all of my heart, but she is no longer the partner I fell in love with.Mentally, I feel like I am stuck and unhappy. I no longer find joy in anything. My passion is stunted and my smile is fake. I have tried to separate from her but she said without me, there is no point in living and will kill herself.

I do not know what to do. I am stuck because of this and that I am living at her father's house. I can move out, but I am afraid of the repercussions. I do not want to lose my love, my partner, my best friend, but I am not happy. What can I do?",relationship_advice

I was even planning to get a job near him after I graduated college this summer. However, we are having some major communication issues. We have been together for about three years, and he lives across the country so facetiming is a major part of our relationship. 

For the past year, he has been just different. I know he is stressed and depressed, but he definitely put me on the side burner. I tried to be less needy, and I have just piled on more extracurriculars and schoolwork to give us some space (for me to get my mind off him). He sometimes guilts me for hanging out with other people and he is rarely sympathetic to the fact that usually I am also stressed and depressed, but I pull myself together.  He refuses to talk to me more than a couple of sentences a day. We rarely have meaningful conversations and when I let him know that I am getting frustrated an lonely, he bombards me with statements about this depression, and how dumb he thinks he is. I always reassure him that he is not dumb, and that is he lovely, but he never believes me or changes. He refuses to even try and change his communication tendencies. 

All I want is to facetime him without having to stare at the wall or watch him play videogames in silence. I know a good chunk of his behavior is do to (untreated) depression. I just want to know if I am being crazy or not. I honestly love him more than anything, but I am so lonely right now and our relationship is starting to seem very unhealthy.  Should I leave him?

t3_dlsti4,My boyfriend [25M] recently started lashing out at me [25F] and I don't know what to do,"Throwaway account since my bf uses reddit; some details changed but still the same gist¬†

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 years started blowing up at me over small things in the past 3 months. Won't communicate what's going on and doesn't want to break up.¬†

Backstory: I first met my boyfriend when we were in high school, but we weren't friends at the time. We didn't start dating until college started as we ended up going to the same school out of state. Relationship started towards the end of freshman year. Senior year rolls around and I apply for jobs for after graduation. He decided to do an accelerated master's program- so he graduated a year later. Even with starting to go on seperate tracks, it didn't change with us wanting a long term relationship. We both started working in the same city after he graduated, and moved in together. We had stayed over at each other's places in college very consistently, so moving in felt like nothing new. There were some rough patches starting out but we worked through them by talking it out.¬†

At this point we've been together for over 6 years. And what felt like out of nowhere in the past 3 months, he started becoming a huge dick. He would blow up about a plethora of things: I forgot to turn off the light in the bathroom, I used one too many dishes this week (even if I end up doing the dishes), or I left my clothes in the washer. Anytime I made a mistake, it usually didn't happen again. These weren't habitual slip-ups, or things that haven't happened randomly over the course of staying at each other's places in college or in the first two years we were living together. I never raised my voice like he did when I messed up. After the times he yelled, he would apologize. Otherwise it would just be really pissed off remarks. If he had done any of the mistakes I made, he would just say ""So?""or ""It's not a big deal."" It wasn't until last week that I finally brought it up. I asked him why he had to be so hostile all the time. Also why did he never recognize that some mistakes he made were the same ones he yelled at me for. I told him I felt scared not knowing what he was going to yell about. This hit him like a brick. He almost started breaking down and saying he didn't realize he was such an asshole. He said he was stressed from work and didn't realize how much of it he was bringing home. I forgave him and just asked him to be more aware of what he's saying. Even if I'm stressed from work, I never took it out on him. After that conversation, I thought that would be the end of it. Until today. He screamed at me for leaving a bowl next to the sink from the previous day, and threatened to break it. I brought up the same conversation from last week and asked him why he's doing this again. He had the same response- almost crying, calling himself an asshole, saying it's stress from work. This time I asked him if he wanted to break up and he said ""No, how could you say that? I promise I'll be better.""¬†

And it's not like he's a complete a neat-freak. He leaves his clothes lying around, he'll forget to take out the trash. But if I'm making any mistakes, it's not okay. I feel like I'm with a completely different person now. He's been more distant in general, less affectionate than before. I talked to some of our close mutual friends to see if he mentioned something going on with him. None of them said anything. I tried talking to him about his stress from work, or he wants to consider switching companies. He quickly ended the conversation and said he just didn't want to talk about it. Everything has been more tense and I just hate coming home everyday.¬†

I don't know if I should just end it now or wait it out even longer. We've been together for so long, and I do love him. We went from always been open and communicated to each other, until now. He has a pretty good relationship with family so I don't think it's stemming from that either. I've ruled out couple's counseling since I know he's not a huge fan of therapy- I had counseling when I was in college. He supported during that but said he wouldn't want it for himself.¬†",relationship_advice

t3_dlmhek,I [21M] found a note in gf‚Äôs [21F] phone that contained ways she could kill herself,"I‚Äôve been dating my gf for almost a year and a half. She‚Äôs had serious depression since 8th grade, and I don‚Äôt know what to do to help. 

Yesterday I went on her notes tab to leave her a cute message and there was a note labeled ‚ÄúWays to leave planet Earth.‚Äù I opened it and in there it had a list of different ways she could kill herself such as overdosing, hanging herself, and even getting hit by a car. At the end of the note it said, ‚ÄúBut I could never leave (me) on this earth alone. I would never do that to him‚Äù or something along those lines. 

Earlier in our relationship her sister had a private conversation with me basically telling me that she has been very depressed for a very long time, yet ever since she met me things have changed. Once I saw the note on her phone I went through other notes which contained similar things just explaining how sad she is and how she wishes this ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù will go away and that I am her only hope of light in all this darkness. 

I want to address her about all of this but I don‚Äôt want to push her away or make anything worse. Has anyone been in this situation, and if so what did you do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlpt4g,My boyfriend has raunchy photos of cosplayers and ex‚Äôs,"I discovered raunchy photos of female cosplayers on my boyfriends phone. I asked him why he had them in the first place. His excuse was basically relying upon the fact that he needs it for when he goes ‚Äúunderway on the ship‚Äù (he‚Äôs in the navy) because he gets no service. And he gets tired of being surrounded by dudes and when alone so why not use them for his ‚ÄúTime.‚Äù 

He then told me he discovered on his cloud drive that he had nudes of his previous flings or ex‚Äôs whatever. He apparently did not know they automatically saved. Oh please. So he basically has nudes of other girls he has interacted with. But he will delete them. This meant he didn‚Äôt bother deleting them when he ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù them.

Also, he said he wouldn‚Äôt have those raunchy photos of the cosplayers if he had other photos (hinting that if he had nudes of me). First off, I‚Äôm not going to have him save my nudes especially after knowing he saved other girls. I feel bad for these girls cause what if his phone gets stolen or gets in the wrong hands. I also have to think of my career. I don‚Äôt know what the hell is wrong is with him. I get that he has ‚Äúneeds‚Äù but really?",relationship_advice

Tonight I spent time with him again, and this time he asked me to take my shirt off three different times as well as trying to grab my boobs. At one point he was screaming at me to take my shirt off. His dad said absolutely nothing and got irritated with me when I started slightly pushing this kid away. When I gave him a look he said ""what can I say he likes boobs"" like what?! This kid is two fucking years old. Am I overreacting? How do I even begin to navigate this situation? I left so uncomfortable and haven't heard anything from him.

t3_dlqzwx,I‚Äôm (19F) intimidated by my bf‚Äôs (22M) sexual history,"Title is basically the TLDR.

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a year now and we are so happy together. We fit really well and genuinely love and care for each other. We‚Äôve been on and off because of our own issues with communication, but that‚Äôs all been smoothed out. 

We met in the same first year university program. He is my first everything. But he has more...experience. We‚Äôve had issues in the past because when we weren‚Äôt together he would hook up with people but did not tell me about it. 

We have had a few conversations where we delved into his past a bit. After he got out of his last relationship (which was 3 hours) he had a bit of a ‚Äúhoe phase‚Äù. When I first learned this I didn‚Äôt mind, but as we‚Äôve explored ourselves sexually with one another I have begun to feel really intimidated. 

We recently played a ‚Äútruth or drink‚Äù card game that was sex themed. I almost couldn‚Äôt answer 89% of the questions because I was so inexperienced. He could answer all of them, which I voiced I didn‚Äôt want to hear about and he respected.

I‚Äôve brought up my feelings to him and he is very understanding, but he has communicated that it makes him fear that because I feel there is an imbalance in our experience and I feel this way I will end the relationship to explore myself sexually. Essentially he thinks I‚Äôll eventually dump him just to fuck other people. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose him. I love him so much and can‚Äôt imagine myself with anyone else. But this intimidation I feel makes me wish we were on the same level with our sexual history. 

How do I get over this or cope with this? Has anyone else felt this way? Are these feelings going to get in the way in the future?

t3_dlsobx,Gut feeling ruining relationship,"I (18F) have been talking this guy (19M) for about 8 months now. At first it was super exciting and fun, but I knew I started to talk to him out of loneliness and a need for attention. I never was ‚Äúas head over heels‚Äù for someone as the other person was for me. I don‚Äôt believe in love as much as others. Maybe that‚Äôs wrong, but just how I feel.  Anyways, he wasn‚Äôt like my previous relationships. He valued me but wasn‚Äôt obsessed with me, we were best friends, had similar interests. He made me believe that relationships might not be so bad after all. It was the best 4 months I‚Äôve shared with someone. However, I criticize myself harshly and remember always being super insecure around him. I had no reason to be, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled with since childhood. I felt like I needed to be perfect for him even if there was no pressure from him. We go to the same uni &amp; before summer break I began to have this gut feeling that this ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù (we never made anything official) was wrong and I needed to get out. I‚Äôve gotten this gut feeling before with previous guys, but I thought he would be different. I told him I get anxious when things get serious, and I needed to work on myself before I invest in myself. This is true.  We stopped talking for 3 months, but he was constantly on my mind. I tried forgetting him by hooking up with another guy, but he wasn‚Äôt him. It didn‚Äôt feel right. We get back to school, and it‚Äôs just been on and off. We think things are back to normal but then my old feelings come crawling back again. Right now, we aren‚Äôt talking at all but we are on good terms.

t3_dlqurb,"My mother (58f) has a bf (59m) for the first time in 25 years, and she‚Äôs driving me (33f) insane","My mother and I have a pretty good relationship overall, even though we live on opposite sides of the US. We text pretty much every day, and we talk on the phone once a week or so. 

A few months ago, she reconnected with a man she dated as a teenager, they realized there was still something there, and they started dating again. I even got to meet him on a recent trip back home to visit, and he seems like a great guy. 

Some backstory on my mom before I go any further: My parents divorced when I was young because my dad was cheating. My mom was blindsided and got through it all by vowing not to let anyone ever tell her what to do again. She bought a house, worked three jobs while putting herself through college, and got her masters all while raising three kids. She never even entertained the idea of dating anyone for the last 25 years. 

Now here‚Äôs the issue. I feel uncomfortable with the things my mom shares with me about her relationship. She doesn‚Äôt share sexual details, thank goodness, but she complains to me anytime he makes a remark she sees as being critical towards her. 

For example, her bf was present for a recent conversation she had with my brother (30m) and his wife about when they were planning on having a second child. Afterward, my mom‚Äôs bf told her he thought she was rude for asking them, as it isn‚Äôt any of her business. My mom responded by telling him she can talk to her children about anything she wants to because they‚Äôre her children, not his. 

She then turned around and bombarded me with a flurry of texts about the situation, basically saying, ‚Äúcan you believe the nerve of this guy?!‚Äù But like, yeah, I can. He‚Äôs not wrong. She was out of line. 

On the flip side, she also texts me mushy crap about him all the time. For example, she recently texted me, verbatim, ‚ÄúOMG, my hunny is the sweetest man, he‚Äôs just worked his way right into my heart!‚Äù With like fifteen heart emojis. 

The up and down of it is just too much, and I feel like my mom‚Äôs a teenager again. I‚Äôm happy that she has found someone, but Lordy, I just want her to shut up about it, at least to me. How should I approach this situation without coming across like I don‚Äôt support her or her relationship??",relationship_advice
t3_dlsjuk,I (29F) have dreamt about my ex (31M) for 7 years,"TLDR and question at bottom, also on mobile so apologies for formatting. I hope this is the right place to ask.

As title states, I literally haven't stopped thinking about my ex for 7 years. He's not dead or anything. I dream about him atleast once a month, every month vividly and I don't know why. I will call him ""Jim"" for this story.

Some backstory.  Jim and I broke up a little over 7 years ago after dating for 2 years.  It was completely mutual. It was a slow downward spiral. We were both tired and unhappy.  I knew him for a year before we dated and absolutely lusted after him. 

2 weeks after we broke up, (and I know I fucked up here.) But I started dating someone else. it was such a short interval between the two relationships, that my ex, unbelievably upset and accusatory, blocked me on everything: Facebook, phone number, other sites, friends, and eventually email. He said for me to never talk to him again . I sent some emails before he blocked me there, profusely apologizing and saying he didn't understand. (I honestly can't remember what all was said back and forth it was so long ago). He responded plainly and then blocked me. 

Since then, I havent heard a word from him or seen him. Through some friends and happen chance over the years, he started dating a girl I semi knew only a month after we broke up (wowee). She first blocked me on FB but then unblocked some years later (idkwhy bc we aren't even friends).  They got married this year. 

The thing about them, is that she is everything Jim said he hated about me. (Gonna give a real short version of this). He would  Photoshop pictures of me to look fatter so I'd lose weight and tell me to get a boob job. His new wife is bigger now than I was back then. He said piercings and tattoos were disgusting. She has them. Jim abhored alcohol. She drinks it. He wouldn't let us get any more pets. They got 4 extra minimum. He said he would never marry me and it was stupid. They got married.  I only know all this through random photos that popped up on some social media sites And some friends. 

I currently am happily married and have a child as well. I have literally zero desire to be with my Ex. We were a poor match ultimately. My ex was, in hindsight, mean. 

 But I still can't stop thinking of him. When I found out he had a girlfriend, I dreamt of being in their house. I dreamt of him being with me. Every month I dream about him. When I'm awake I don't think about him at all. There is no longing, no desire, nothing. But when I'm asleep I just dream about him. In my sleep, I dream about seeing him at random places and talking. About having lunch , about being in his room. About the past.  When I found out they got married it occurred even more.  I dream we bump into each other and makeout. About him and me dating presently. Some I remember so vividly. I can remember a dream I had about him 4 years ago. 

I just want it to stop. I don't want to talk to Jim, there's zero productivity from that and only drama if so. 


TLDR: mutual breakup. Dated again too soon, ex blocks me on everything. Marries girl that has everything he hated. I can't stop thinking about him when I sleep. Don't care about him awake.

What's wrong with me? Why can't I stop thinking about him? How do I stop? I truly am happier now and just want to live my life",relationship_advice

t3_dlsir8,My (23F) boyfriend (26M) rejected a gift that I got him. Caused a huge fight. What went wrong here?,"Title pretty much says it all. I bought him a calendar from World Market.

t3_dlsicg,How can I(25M) get distanced from her(27F) without hurting her?,"Initially, I tried to date her, but she rejected me for religious reasons. I don't think she will change her view on this.

We haven't been friends for that long, but we keep in contact daily, and we have been meeting at least once per week. We have a lot of things in common so that helps.

I hinted her that our relationship won't be the same forever as we are just friends , and because life will get in the way at some point ,  but she replied things like ""I want to have you in my life forever"" or ""your support is truly important for me and missing you will make me very sad""

At the same time, I feel that she is just lonely and happened to meet someone who cares about her for the first time. She said that this is the first time that anyone ""cared so much about her"" and that is ""great to be taken care of"". She is very supportive and appreciative, so I don't think that she is taking advantage of me.

I don't know if it will be selfish to say something like ""I appreciate you having in my life, and taking care of you, but I am developing very strong feelings for you and it just hurts to have you around"". Should I write her a letter? Many times I felt very strong needs to hold and kiss her, and obviously friends don't do that. Perhaps she should know about this.

I feel that she is lonely, and that my support is truly helping her. At the same time some feelings are just hard to cope for me, and it is not that easy to be kind and take all that in. It is also taking a lot of time and energy to support her, and  I am also starting to have problems to look at other women so that does not help either.

I tried to reduce contact with her, but that did not work. She does not have any problem starting and keeping the conversation. I don't feel that she deserves to be ignored, blocked or ghosted.

t3_dlqswh,My [30M] sex life is non-existent and I'm beginning to lose touch with my marriage's sexuality,"Short bio: 30M married to 32F for 6 years, been together for 11 years. I've had a non-existent sex life for a few years now (Yes, I've heard of /r/deadbedrooms  \- I want some real advice, not bitter ideas. I have enough of those on my own)

Years after, she's making an effort, but I cannot respond to her. I don't feel it anymore, not that my libido is dead, she just can't trigger it now. Perhaps I'm too bitter, or perhaps I used my imagination to explore sexuality for so long that now it's disconnected from her.

I was thinking on trying to go to a sex club or something to perhaps get us in the mood or something. Perhaps if we became aroused around each other we'd reconnect that aspect of our lives. As it happens some of our closest friends (couple) went to one, and when I asked my wife to do it she immediately rejected the idea. Probably jealousy?

I don't know how to approach this or try to explore while keeping her happy, but I do know I loathe how things are. I love her very much though and I cannot imagine life without her.

Apparently we both are very conflict avoidant, which doesn't help us at all.

t3_dlsg2n,My (24 f) boyfriend (25 m) shut me out for two hours because he argued with his dad,"My boyfriend and I (together for 2 years) were supposed to meet up in my house at 9 pm. As close as 30 mins before that he messaged saying he‚Äôd be over at 9, was just taking a shower. Everything was good. I got ready, waited, 9 pm came and he never showed. At 9:15 I sent him a message asking if he was on the way. Still nothing. At 9:30 I figured he might have fallen asleep, however he would have been annoyed if he hadn‚Äôt woken up so I called him and nothing. Normally he would hear his phone even if he was asleep.

At about 9:45 I was a little worried so I drove the 10 mins over to his house just to make sure he was ok/had fallen asleep on the couch and he wasn‚Äôt there. The car was gone. At this point it was getting close to 10pm I was worried, had no idea where he could be. I drove back to mine and messaged his friend just in case he‚Äôd heard from him. And no. At 10:30 I decided to drive around a bit, I was genuinely worried something could have happened to him. And on the way past a bar I spotted his car outside and a few minutes later him come out of the bar and into his car. 

That was around 11pm, two hours after we were supposed to meet up in mine. I drove home and got a message as I got home saying ‚Äúon the way over now‚Äù. When he got in I questioned him and asked why he didn‚Äôt reply/disappeared for 2 hours and his excuse was he had to give his dad a lift somewhere and then had a big argument with him. I asked why he didn‚Äôt just send me a quick message to let me know. He said he was too stressed/just couldn‚Äôt. I then asked him if we went to a bar after and he lied and said no.

Am I being overly picky/needy or is this problematic and he‚Äôs being selfish and immature? I admitted to him that I saw him leave the bar and he told me he didn‚Äôt want to tell me in case I‚Äôd argue. 

The problem isn‚Äôt really going to the bar, it‚Äôs that he left me in the dark for 2 hours not knowing where he was. All I needed was one quick message just to say he didn‚Äôt space for an hour or two and it would have been fine.

t3_dlod1a,I don't know if I should tell my mom about my childhood sexual abuse,"Whats up! Welcome to my post.

As the title goes, I don't know if I should tell my about when I was abused as a child. It happened for a couples years when I was around 3 years old (by a family member), and quite honestly I was able to keep that burden locked down for a very long time. 

Recently, I just came to terms with the abuse. I finally, within the past couple weeks, have been able to actually call it sexual abuse. I know realized that it has caused me great emotional and mental health, as well as distorted my view in relationships, sex, and companionship. I am okay and healing from all this. Still working on finding my peace in all this, and forgiving myself for everything. It has, however, really fucked up my mood.

I think that she has noticed a considerable shift in my mood (I'm more irritable, stand off-ish, melancholy) because of me grieving, and it has caused us to really get into some arguments. I havent been working out/studying/or preparing to ship as much as she thinks I need to be. I have been spending my weekends with friends (and yes we drink and go to bars, I'm young), but shes blaming them as the distraction and the reason for me slacking off. When in reality its my suffering mental health. Even saying that I'm ""throwing everything away."" My mother is an amazing woman with the emotional and mental resiliency that I strive to have in life. She has overcome so much, which is why I don't know if I should tell her. I don't want to burden her with something I know I can work through on my own, when she has already dealt with so much pain in her life. 

So, thoughts?

tldr: I was sexually abused as a child and it has caused me to act differently. My concerned mother is worried, but it's causing arguments. Do I tell her?",relationship_advice

t3_dlqn5m,I don't trust my best friend,"Some backstory is required here.

I(m19) met my first online friend(f23), honestly my only close friend ever, back in 2017 when I was 17. We met playing a common game together. Over the next 2 years we've gotten very close. We both have serious mental health issues, and it was nice to have someone to rely on. But then the issues started. There was always something wrong. An injury, an illness, a dead family member. She lost an uncle and a grandma, has a brain tumor, has constant small injuries, or is sick. She has a young daughter too, and was apparently raped by her ex husband. We have voice chatted and video chatted, so Im pretty sure it isnt phishing, and shes never asked for anything. We've tried to meet up several times, but shes always canceled at the last minute for one reason or another. Im a very empathetic person, so everything she tells me really affects me. Today she told me she was being abused for the past year, and nobody believes her, including the police, as well as mentioning she is going blind. I cant help being suspicious, and it hurts being suspicious of my best friend. But there is just so much. And then today, I looked up her uncle, the one who died recently. The only person of that name who died in her area died 3 years ago in 2016. I dont know what to do. My first instinct is to call her out, but she is suicidal, and I dont want to trigger it. If I take any action, and Im wrong, Im likely consigning someone I care about to abuse and death. I don't know what to do. Every day is hard, hearing about whatever new problem there is. Im getting more and more depressed, and I don't know how long I can last.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqn31,Was I date raped? Story of night included,"So there was this nice looking guy I talked to on tinder months ago now.  I didn't use it for a long time,  but I was lulled into this sense of safety with him.  He acted like he understood me so well,  and said how he never felt this way about anyone before.  It made me feel special so I went along with it.  After a few weeks we met up and decided to go for some drinks. I really warmed to him at first,  he was acting nervous with his leg shaking and he made a joke of it.  I felt very comfortable with him.  

I remember finishing after the second beer my guard was way down,  and I was now opening up to the atmosphere.  We were in a beer garden and some people approached we start talking to them,  laughing etc... He slips out to get more beers,  I didn't think twice about it when he came back,  I was drinking the alcohol like a fish,  next thing I know I was dancing all around the bar,  and making a complete fool of myself,  all my inhibitions were gone.  The strange thing is I don't even dance,  I never dance in public ever.  I didn't care what I looked like,  it felt like I was having the time of my life.  What is really strange about this is that alcohol has never had that affect on me ever.  I don't think I was drugged either, I didn't pass out or anything, I was able to dance etc... Looking back it seems I was on something a lot more than alcohol. 

So moving on from this,  I remember I got really bad blisters on my feet from all the dancing like a maniac around the place,  which is the opposite of me.  I remember he gave me his socks to wear and I put on flats.  That is the last vivid memory I have of that night. He then casually said to leave, I would never go to someone's place I never met,  I was acting like a child and lost all normal thinking and feeling of my independence.  I have no memory of the taxi at all.  I don't remember the taxi driver,  I don't remember riding in the taxi,  I have no even vague pictures of it.  Its as if it never happened. The next thing I have a memory of is walking into his apartment and seeing a ton of shoes in the hallway,  and commenting on it,  and him saying something back.  I didn't feel scared,  but it was like I was having an out of body experience.  I have no memory of going to the bedroom,  or taking off any clothes or anything,  I have one or two vague snapshots in my head of him penetrating me without a condom,  and having no will to do anything about it.  It was as if I passed out after I took those two snapshots with my eyes,  cause I've no other memory.  The shoes in the hallway,  and the vague snapshot of him penetrating me,   is all I have after putting the socks on in the bar. 

I woke up the next day,  feeling very out of it,  spaced,  disorientated,  and a complete mess.  I remember  he looked so awake and healthy, I immediately feeling humiliated and embarrassed and was blaming myself for the state I was in.  I was only planning on having a drink or two with this guy and next thing I am in a terrible condition in his bed.  I didn't have any memory at this point. I remember him confiding in me that He had sex with men,  at this point I am freaking out internally,  about what this guy could have passed to me. He went to make toast,  I ended up having some,  he says I can use the shower if I want. I felt invaded,  and needed to leave. When I go to get the bus home I realize I am in this really dodgy part of the city,  and am feeling so empty and gross about myself,  I felt so low and depressed.  I have now done a HIV test after worrying for weeks about it  and am anxiously awaiting the results.  I feel like throwing up when I think of that night.  I wasn't even in a state to ask to use a condom, he took advantage of that.  In hindsight he took advantage of me by not putting me in a taxi to go home, do you think it is all my fault? I am full of self blame now and have been since thinking how stupid can you be,  you created this mess,  and now you could be Ill for life. Very down and out about this,  I don't know how to handle this,  I allowed this to happen. It's all my fault.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsbxk,How to make move on ex girlfriend (19) whose coming my (19) flat?,"
The relationship after the break up has been up and down, we could talk for weeks and then go NC for months. We recently got in touch again and something is different this time. I've invited her to come to my new flat and she says she would be down, she is also up for doing hanging out with me other times too, as friends or because she wants more? But she doesn't make this very clear, shes very concealed with her feelings. There is definitely a spark between us, there always was and that never faded even after the break up. Im so awful at confessing to a girl my feelings and what not or trying to make a move on them that doesnt come off awkward, so my question is

How should i go about her coming to my flat? What should i do to make her feel like i do fancy her? I want to make a move on her but how can i do this in a way thats not awkward or will leave her disappointed? When i say make a move i dont mean sex, maybe just a simple kiss, but something which shows her that i dont want a friendship i want a relationship again

t3_dlo7mu,My (23M) girlfriend (22F) of 3 years cheated on me.,"Sorry for the long post I need this.
We've been together for 3 years, the first two years were heaven on earth, yeah we had our arguments but nothing that couldn't be solved.
We went through everything together, she met my family I met hers, we we're sure we will eventually get engaged and married and so on.
Everyone used to tell me that I was the best boyfriend she could ever have and that she was the best girlfriend I could ever have, we were perfect for each other and we were both treated in an amazing way.
Then the third year happened, she started to avoid me sometimes, not allow me to hold or touch her (both intimate and normal ways), she wouldn't kiss me, we had many many fights concerning the subject of her not treating me well anymore, it felt like she's drawing herself away, we even broke up for a few days because she thought it was a good thing for both of us, and she came crawling back because it was a bad decision, she tried to be better (but still wouldn't kiss me and would barely allow me to hold her hand). Then I found out the truth, she was cheating on me with a ""close"" friend of mine, they became friends a couple of months back and apparently she was kissing him and sending him ""pictures"" and doing NSFW shit with him (but no s*x). For a week she did all of this then she felt guilty and decided to end everything because she loves me. Once I found out 5 months later I started crying in front of her and started to yell and scream and shout, she was crying because she ""loves"" me and she ruined everything, she couldn't stop crying she explained that she was disgusted by her acts and that she wanted to fix things. After an hour of talking I drove her to her university, she has pharmacy exams and she's failing all her courses and getting shit grades because of how depressed she is, she told me once she finishes her exams we will talk about what to do with our lives. 

I never hated someone more, because I believed in her I trusted her I put all my faith in her, and yet I want to be with her, I need to be with her I crave her both physically and mentally and emotionally, and I hate myself for this. I don't know what to do I just came here and wrote everything.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsalx,My (19F) boyfriend (21M) hurt me today but he never did anything like that before,"He came over to my apartment after his class and he did bad on an exam so he was upset and in a bad mood. I wasn‚Äôt feeling good either, I had bad period cramps so I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to be comforting him. He was just acting like a baby, he wanted me to get food for him and cuddle him. I know he was upset but I get intense period cramps and I wasn‚Äôt feeling like spoiling him. He was annoyed that I wasn‚Äôt giving him attention and then I was on my phone and he was upset that I wasn‚Äôt talking to him. I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk. He complained that I was on my phone and he asked me who I was talking to and I said no one because I was just scrolling thru Instagram. He didn‚Äôt believe me and he tried to grab my phone from me which he‚Äôs never done before and I wouldn‚Äôt let him so I snatched it back and told him to leave me alone because I have cramps and he was being annoying. I wasn‚Äôt even talking to anyone but it just bothered me that he was trying to grab it from me like I‚Äôm a child. Then he seriously randomly slapped me across my face really hard and started choking me like squeezing my neck so hard with both of his hands, it hurt so bad, it felt like my whole face was purple. He never hit me before, it was so unexpected and weird and random like it was someone else. My boyfriend is not like that, he‚Äôs usually the most sensitive sweet guy ever, definitely not the type to ever HIT SOMEONE. He made me think he was the type to never hurt a fly. I was so confused and scared about what was going on. It seriously felt like a real assault or attack. It wasn‚Äôt just a small slap or something, I have all these red blood vessels on my cheek now. I can‚Äôt believe my own boyfriend did that to me. I think that he assumed no one else was home since I was in the living room but my roommate was in her room and she came out and screamed at him to stop. Then he just ran out. Since then, he‚Äôs texted me a few things like how he‚Äôs so sorry and he feels so bad. I didn‚Äôt reply to any of it because I don‚Äôt know what to say. Apparently doesn‚Äôt know what got into him and he asked me if my cramps got better. I didn‚Äôt know this but he told me that his dad used to hit his mom and that it ruined his childhood and he has a lot of trauma and problems and he wants to start therapy and he wants me to go with him so we can talk about what happened and figure it out. 

Honestly I‚Äôm just really confused. It was like he did a complete 180. He was fine this morning and we‚Äôve been dating for a year, he never acted like that before. Then he got his bad test grade and I wasn‚Äôt feeling in the mood to comfort him and he just slapped me and started choking me which he never ever did before. It was like another person. This is the guy who doesn‚Äôt even like rough sex because he feels too scared of hurting me. I just feel so. Confused. That‚Äôs the only word I can use to describe this feeling. I saw a stranger today. Like something possessed him. Please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

t3_dls9og,My [31/m] friend [28/m] has became an Incel,"As the title says, my **[31/m]** friend **[28/m]** has became an Incel.

Let me elaborate this and sorry for the grammar since english is not my first language. Warning, this is going to be a long post.

So an old friend of mine has slowly became an incel during the last year and a half. He was a normal guy in terms of women, he had a girlfriend, he was training and studying a government exam to became a policeman and working as a cook at the same time. He was joyful and a good guy.

18 months ago he passed the physical tests and the exam to became policeman, but in the last selection baremo, an interview driven in this case by 2 girls (this is important) he was sacked. This 2 girls are kinda known in that world for being biased in favour of woman, not a lot of men get the green light from them and male applicants are afraid of having to do the interview with them. Truth is that a lot of people pass all the test but the government has to thin out the final candidates and a lot of good people (and I guess also bad) get kicked out. Also it's true that a way bigger percentage of women pass this last test than men. Even if the percentage of men passing all the previous tests is bigger, but nowdays the government wants to be more inclusive and get more women to be policeman. Not 100% fair but that's what it is, what are you gonna do. He trained &amp; studied hard for 2 years for that chance.

No long after that his girlfriend left him. You know, the typical, it's not you, bla,bla, bla. A while after he was told that she was fucking others guys and even if I used to like the girl (she was funny and nice to be around), she was a total piece of shit and made him suffer.

So slowly but sureley he started to get in a depression, he is always sadder and sadder. He got another job as cook (tbh is a shitty job and he hates it, but what you gonna do).

I tried to encourage him to train for the policeman tests again but he has always refused so I don't even try anymore. Always that I know of some kind of official examns for government jobs I let him know and encourage him to study them so he can get out of the restaurant life. But he never does.

He has became more and more depressed over time and what is worse, he really despise women. Slowly but sureley he has became a true incel in the last year and a half. His comments about women are becoming worse and worse. Calling all of them who*#es, bitch#*s, ""what do you expect from a woman?"" comments, etc.

I laugh those comments off trying to not entering in conflic with him. But they are becoming more and more prominent as time passes. And his usual group of friends are not helping with it cause they are kinda like that too. He is also becoming more extremist with his political ideas (far right).

I'm trying to help him, some time ago he asked me to go bouldering with him and I did, and I really loved it. Now it's my n¬∫1 hobby but he doesn't practice it anymore. I still play videogames with him and I try to get him to do stuff on his free days (climbing, go to the cinema, go have some beers, etc). But he is kinda refusing every time more and more this offers. 

He is deeply depressed (doesn't want to hang out, told me he doesn't clean his apartament, etc) and I'm trying to get him out of it. He also refuses to go out and try to met a girl, join Tinder, anyhting. He totally refuses, cursing about women and how shitty they are, insulting them every time anything related to them comes into a conversation. I think the interview thing and his exgirlfriend have been a huge toll in his mental health.

I like this guy and he is a good person, but this behaviour is going worse and worse with time, and at this point im kinda embarassed of him (I would never introduce my girlfriend to this guy cause I would be afraid she could think that I share any of his ideas). He is deeply depressed and a total incel and I don't know how to get him out of this toxic loop. I think getting him to know a girl would help him greatly, but I don't know if it's a bit too late since his behaviour towards women is kinda shitty and he is not the cutest guy around either. I don't think I can talk straight to him about this cause he will brush it off or tell me to go to hell and cut his relationship with me. So I'm lost, but I also want him to change before he gets to the point I have to just cut him off of my life.

TLDR: Because of some events related with women and a shitty job, my friend has became an Incel and got into depression in the last year and a half and I don't know how to deal with this.",relationship_advice

His Mom on the other hand has recently chosen that I am the anti christ and shall rain hell upon her child.....

A bit more background:

So My step mom has a nasty habit of being full of shit and so me and my boyfriend split up for a bit (two months) it was something we both needed but not something I would ask for... so we broke up because his mom told mine I apparently slept with 7 people well with him..... I didn‚Äôt sleep with anyone but I had a bad addiction problem and fooled around with my drug dealers but I am clean and we worked past it ( we got in a fight and talked it took a bit but we got through it) it has been a bit but I have always made sure to insure him I understand why he gets nervous or mad about guys ect. ( I just don‚Äôt talk to anyone but him now NOT because I‚Äôll cheat but because I don‚Äôt like being watched even though I understand why) so fast forward to this summer we split for the 2 months and I get in a situation where I‚Äôm homeless and living in a tent with a dog so I start sleeping in his car, we get back together, and I‚Äôm still in the car, at this point his mom didn‚Äôt hate me yet. 

So I‚Äôm sleeping in this car every night and it‚Äôs getting cold as shit so one day she comes back from work hella early and tells me to get off the property and I‚Äôm not welcome... I am shocked and don‚Äôt understand but I comply and pack my stuff (slow) she asks my boyfriend to go inside and I take probably 20 minutes to pack a small backpack. My boyfriend came out crying so me now pissed asks what she said... apparently well I was homeless I contacted my parents (kicked me out) to tell my mom how he is abusive!!! Like this woman knows my mother lies they work together it‚Äôs a small town but she picked to believe her after my mom lying about something she[ boyfriends mom] said and we had to clear it up 5 months prior { being that she said I slept with 7 people whe I didn‚Äôt my mom said she said it and she (boyfriends mom said she didn‚Äôt we talked and I picked to believe she didn‚Äôt}

t3_dlqe2u,No affection in an otherwise good marriage,"My wife(38F) and I(36M) have been together for 11 years. We have had very few issues in our marriage and, when the rare issue arises, we always discuss it calmly and are both pretty quick to admit wrongdoings and apologize. I'm lucky and I know it.

The one issue I have is that she almost never shows any type of physical affection. She often reciprocates if I initiate but at other times it feels like she is just tolerating me and I will disengage. I could chalk this up to me simply misreading her moods but I don't think that is likely as everything else, all the little things in a long term relationship that you learn to gauge, will be completely normal when this happens.

When being intimate I always have to be very aware because if I try to ""get her in the mood"" she won't show any sign that she is interested like, at all. But then if I shy away and decide maybe it isn't a good time/she isn't into it she will be like ""why did you stop?""

She appreciates when I give her compliments and show her attention. She tells me that she loves me (and I know she does) but she never shows any kind of affection. I have purposely stopped initiating physical contact before and we went for two weeks without even a hug before I finally caved. She never even noticed. During that time we kept interacting as normal. We did the same things, made the same jokes and if you had asked her, things would've been great. She didn't know it was killing me. 

We've discussed this before and I have tried to make my feelings known but it doesn't change. I get that some people just aren't affectionate and I have tried to make peace with that but it is difficult for me because I am a very affectionate type.

The other morning when I woke up she was awake and lying with her back to me on her phone. I got up to pee and brush my teeth then got back in bed. When I kissed her cheek she smiled but never looked away from her phone. I laid there and and rubbed her back a bit and, tbh was hoping to get her in the mood but after a few minutes of her ignoring me and just scrolling fb I gave up. I wasn't mad but I was hurt. I tried not to let on or to make a big deal of it. 

This has happened many times and it is wearing me down. I don't mind being turned down for sex and a simple ""some other time"" would be fine but being ignored is crushing. It makes me feel invisible. 

This last time has really hit me hard and now I don't even want to be affectionate with her. I have been distant these last few days and she's noticed because I can't hide it very well right now. I'm heartbroken. She brought it up today before I went to work and I told her it wasn't a good time but we could talk later. Thing is, even if we discuss it again I still don't want to make myself vulnerable with her anymore because I dont think this will ever change. 

Side note: I in no way want this to be over and am not even considering that as an option. I just don't know where to go from here.",relationship_advice

t3_dllml6,I think [30M] I messed up in an argument and now she [26F] wants space to think,"TL;DR: Girlfriend and I got into an argument via text about my feelings on her not being upfront about us being in a relationship online. The argument got out of hand and now she wants a few days to speak about it.

I want to preface this by saying we both stream on Twitch, which is the crux of where the argument comes into play. We met on Twitch, it‚Äôs a long distance relationship, but we‚Äôve met multiple times in the few months we‚Äôve been dating.

I‚Äôm looking for a few things here: First a gut check ‚Äì¬†am I being controlling here? Second, what‚Äôs a better way I could have approached this topic? And last, if she gives me a chance to talk through things, how do I proceed?

The argument started Saturday when we were in a mutual friend‚Äôs stream. We have a reputation for being very playful together in chat ‚Äì nothing lovey dovey, it‚Äôs more like teasing and rib poking. One of the viewers, who is also a viewer in our respective channels, asked us if we were a couple. It‚Äôs not something we‚Äôve disclosed openly but we‚Äôve had a conversation about it off stream and decided that we wouldn‚Äôt hide our relationship if it was ever brought up. I wasn‚Äôt present in chat when the question was initially asked but when I came back I saw that she ignored it.

I messaged her privately saying that I saw she dodged the question and she said it caught her off guard and she didn‚Äôt want to blast her business in someone else‚Äôs chat. I said ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôll just tell everyone I‚Äôm single. NBD.‚Äù Which, in hindsight, wasn‚Äôt something I should have said. I apologized but told her that her hiding our relationship on Twitch like that really bothered me because we said we would be open about it. I also brought up that she hadn‚Äôt told her family about us yet even though she said she was going to in multiple instances.

I‚Äôd like to recreate the conversation as much as possible because I want it to sound objective but it‚Äôs too long. The general idea is that I told her I‚Äôd like her to at least acknowledge that we are in a relationship if it every comes up in conversation. She told me that it was something that she was willing to do but that she wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing it and that she would need time to do it.

I think I got pushy in my argument because I pulled out examples in the past where weird things happened in chat that could be avoided if people knew she was in a relationship. And I kept asking her why it was so important that she hide that she‚Äôs in a relationship when she discusses other details of her personal life on stream. She told me that her privacy was important to her and that even if she dated someone who lived in the same city as her, she wouldn‚Äôt disclose that information online either. It‚Äôs important to note that she doesn‚Äôt disclose relationship info on any social media platform ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think this is a big deal because I don‚Äôt either, I‚Äôm just sharing it to show that she is consistent in her stance.

My intention with the questions was to simply try and understand her side of the argument better so I could try and see things from her perspective, but I didn‚Äôt feel like she ever really explained it to me. I feel like I came off aggressive through the text even though I was just hurt by it. Everything ended Sunday morning (it was a 2-day fight) by her saying she‚Äôd be open with things online ‚Äì essentially giving into my resolution, which I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with because I wanted to work toward a resolution together. Regardless, the conversation was over and we didn‚Äôt speak again until Sunday when I hopped into her stream.

She acted normally in the stream. We joked back and forth and she made a few comments alluding to our relationship ‚Äì she was making an effort to do what I asked. This made me feel like shit because I know that‚Äôs not what she wanted and I feel like I pushed her into that without making more of an effort to understand where she was coming from. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to explain that.

After the stream on Sunday evening, I didn‚Äôt hear from her until I texted her late that night asking if she was gone for the night. She said she wasn‚Äôt and that she was at a friend‚Äôs house because her friend‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. We talked about that for a bit and I asked her if she would like to call when she got back home. She said yes and we hopped on a call when she got home.

The conversation was kind of awkward and I asked if we were okay. She kind of hesitated and said things were okay but she felt sore about the argument. Totally understandable, I did, too. I asked if she wanted to get off and she said yeah, she needed time to think about things. I said okay and she asked if we could hang out Monday night.

Fast forward to Monday, I respected her space and waited for her to message me. She finally did after 5 p.m. and said that she wasn‚Äôt ready to talk, she wanted to talk later in the week. I was admittedly pretty confused and asked if she was thinking about breaking up with me. She didn‚Äôt say yes or no, just that she needed time to think about how things went down over the weekend.

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship where we‚Äôve waited to talk about something like this and it‚Äôs honestly killing me a little bit. But I messaged her back saying that I felt like I treated her unfair and that‚Äôs not how I wanted conflicts between us to be resolved. I also said that I wanted to respect her space and that I would be here to talk when she was ready.

I‚Äôm currently dying on the inside because I‚Äôm confused about what‚Äôs happening, I feel guilty for hurting her and I feel like I royally screwed things up.",relationship_advice

We ended in good terms so I thought, ‚Äúeh, I‚Äôll run into him when we‚Äôre both in good shape‚Äù, but I noticed something weird. He would text me on certain occasions asking me about how I was doing and asking me about my workout stuff which I found a bit strange. Like now you wanna worry about my life?

t3_dloyfe,My (19F) roommate (19F) is being particularly disrespectful and rude towards me. I'm having mixed feelings about reporting her to the dorm administrator.,"Long post, TL;DR at bottom. 

A month ago I started university in a city far from home, so I live in a student dormitory with 3 other girls. We were placed in this room at random, so we did not know each other previously. One month later, I'm having trouble living everyday life because of one of them. For this post's sake, I'll call her Em. The other two are Laura and Deli. 

First of all, she's loud. Loud talking, even louder laughing, and absolutely zero respect for people sleeping in the room. There have been multiple occasions where she and the other roommates would come in the room late at night (2-4 AM) and Em is the one who talks the loudest, followed closely by Deli. Mind you, I go to sleep very early compared to them (11Pm or midnight, compared to 3-4 in the morning), but I really need those hours of sleep in order to function. I'm also a light sleeper, so I often wake up to the sound of the door opening, but what bothers me is Em's complete disregard for the fact that 1. It's late at night and 2. I'm sleeping. I'd totally accept being woken up by the door or their footsteps, but I believe that loud talking and laughing is an asshole move. I've told her to keep it quiet, but she has not changed it so far. 

Speaking of loud. She often plays whatever music she likes in the room. Out loud, maximum volume, no headphones. It doesn't matter if somebody is studying or reading in the room, she will blast the music whenever she likes. I've told her that I don't like her music and I wish she would at least turn it lower so I don't have to hear it through my headphones, but she did nothing about it. When I'm not studying I usually don't comment about it, but I really would like to learn in peace. Same thing when she's watching TV series. She also laughs so much, and so loud, you can hear her from the hallway. Em's laugh often causes Deli to laugh, which is equally loud, if not louder. Again, I wouldn't be bothered if they laughed during the day. But they do it at night when I'm trying to get some shut eye. 

Another thing that bothers me about Em is how bossy and autoritary she is. We made a cleaning schedule that we all agreed to, and last week was my turn to clean. I did clean the room, sweep the floor and everything, but only when nobody was in the room. I don't like cleaning with people around, that's just me. So I cleaned when I was alone. At the end of the week, Friday-Sunday, I was very busy. I spent the day over at my boyfriend's place on Friday, then went to a comic con Saturday and Sunday. I came to my room exhausted and went straight to bed. Sunday evening when I was getting ready to sleep, Em started bitching at me how I didn't do my chores, didn't clean and left a mess on my desk. Granted, my desk was a bit unordered, simply because I couldn't find something that morning and I frantically searched for it. However, she kept insisting that I should have swept the floor that weekend, no matter how tired I was, and that the room was filthy and she had to clean in my place because she couldn't bear it. We got into an argument about cleanliness in the room and she said that the room stank because of me, that the empty, closed jar on my desk was the reason it smelled of food in the room. I pointed out that Deli's late with an uneaten steak since last night was out on the table, but she ignored me saying that Deli's food wasn't her business. 

She constantly says that I'm the reason the room smells, that I'm being the messiest of us all. I will concede that I'm messy, but my desk is full of pens and papers and notebooks. I'm an artist and all my stuff gets scattered around easily. But she claims that it's food and rotten stuff there, which cause the smell. 

She also moved her desk in a way that is very uncomfortable for me. Normally they're placed one next to the other, facing the same way. The room is small, this is important. Last week she turned it 90¬∞, so now I have to move to the left of my desk if she wants to pull out her chair. I told her it's not okay for me and she should move it back, because I don't want to have to move to make her space when the room wasn't designed like this. She said that this is how she wants to stay. 

A huge, huge problem is the number of alarms Em sets every morning. At least 6, ringing every 5 minutes for what seems like an eternity, until either it automatically snoozes or she decides to turn it off. Often when I have classes later in the day and want to sleep longer, her alarm will wake me up at 6 30, and I can't fall back asleep because of the constant stream of alarms. So far I've given up on trying to sleep and woke up, silently cursing her for ruining my sleep day after day. 

I don't get along extremely well with my roommates. They share some vices that I don't: they smoke, they go out clubbing, go out with boys every other night and drink. I don't condemn them, let them do what they want, it's only normal for me to be excluded if I don't share these activities with them. I'm just not that type of person. I've made my peace with it. However it seems to me that Em respects her friends/roommates, Laura and Deli, and keeps quiet when they're asleep or trying to study. She only acts like a jerk around me. 

The drop that filled my glass was last night. Em and Deli came in the room at 4 AM with a bunch of boys who seemed drunk as hell, laughing and talking very very very loudly. Me and Laura were asleep. Laura didn't say anything, but I was grumpy, tired and I told them to keep it down, that it's late and people are sleeping at this hour. Instead of quieting down, they started laughing louder and mocking me. After the boys left I confronted Em about it, telling her that it's not OK to bring people in at this hour, that it's impolite and rude to be this loud when roommates are sleeping and that I don't like what they're doing. Em got defensive and replied that I've also brought my boyfriend in the room and woke her up. Here's the difference: my boyfriend visited me at lunch/afternoon, and always made sure to keep quiet if someone was sleeping at that hour. That accusation and the laugh she had with Deli afterwards just killed it for me. 

I'm done having my sleep ruined by rude, disrespectful Em who doesn't give a shit if I'm sleeping/studying in the room. I want to have my rest, and the respect I deserve and that I treat her with. I'm careful when they're asleep, I'm mindful when they're studying. I'm considering going to the dorm administrator and placing a complaint against her, as well as a request to be moved from this room.

At the same time, I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable and I should adapt to this new lifestyle and tolerate her. Reddit, a word of advice here?

Edit: TL;DR: Roommate has asshole behaviors that disturb my sleep and my study time, as well as generally being rude. This includes loud talking at 3 AM and 20 alarms every morning. I've reached the end of my patience.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqac3,How to help my(31M) girlfriend(25F) after she...cheated on me? (SERIOUS),"Ok this may sounds very ridiculous to some of you, but please guys/girls I am not here for criticism. 
I consider myself as a conscious man, I know the risks, I know that she betrayed my feelings and so on. Of course I will not forgive her again. Never. Period.

But the fact is that I love her and I strongly believe that things can work nice for as again.

Btw, after the affair and her confession (she was painfully honest) she is feeling extremely guilty, shame and sadness. She treats me very well, but she cannot express her feelings like before because of these bad feelings. Even when we laugh I can see the guilty in her eyes. These feelings make the process of healing even more hard.

Also, i try not be the guy who always blames her about this. I took the hard decision to be with her and I want to support her(sounds crazy but it is not)

So redditors what can I do for her in order to make her feel more comfortable for what she did? any thoughts?

t3_dlq1zw,Girlfriend of one year sent nudes to close friend,"My girlfriend( F16) of over a year just told me(F16) that a month before her and I got together, she sent nudes to a close friend of ours (M17). 

It was about two months after she ended her long term 3 year long relationship and she was feeling desperate and lonely, so she texted him (my girlfriend is a lesbian). 

She sent him nudes, and they planned on having sex, but it never happened. 

This friend of ours is really really close to us. He was my ""fake date"" to homecoming just last weekend (unsupportive parents). He hangs out with us constantly. It hurts that I'm just now finding out that he's seen my girlfriends body.

My girlfriend and I were close friends for years beforehand and she told me that she's liked me for as long as she can remember, so part of me feels weird because she didn't turn to me...

I feel like I'm over reacting. It was over a year ago, my girlfriend doesn't even like men, and her and I weren't even together. But it still just makes me feel really weird and uncomfortable and hurt. Am I overreacting?? How do I stop feeling like this?

And if someone were to ask me to talk to her about it... what would I even say?? Because she doesn't seem to think it's a big deal at all, she brought it up very casually.

t3_dlrmaa,I'm sort of a secret girlfriend.. (Sorry for the super long post),"So, my boyfriend [20M] and I [19F] have been dating for almost 6 months now. When we first began dating I was kept a secret from everyone because his close friends hate me (yes, hate is a strong word, but that's the case here), they know me from when we all went to high school together. Less than a month in we told our mutual friends and he told his parents and brother about me (I had already told my mum about the relationship). We are not coming up on 6 months together and he still hasn't told his close friends about us, or even mentioned that he has a girlfriend. At first I didn't think it was a big deal, because it didn't start off all that serious, but things got serious and intense very quickly. There have been multiple times where it has come up in conversation, and he has simply said he would tell them when they're ready (myself and several mutual friends both believe his close friends will never be ""ready"") He and I both know that if he tells his friends, they will make him choose between them and us. I tried to break up with him because of it once, because I knew that if they made him choose, and he chose me he would grow to resent me for it. We've had several fights/disagreements about it. Our most recent fight I told him how I felt (that this wasn't a serious relationship to him which is why he still hasn't told his friends, that I'm not good enough for him in relation to his friends, that he hasn't told them because he plans on leaving before he ever has to tell them, etc.) I suggested telling everyone that we broke up, and then continue to date in secret, because there is a very large possibility that someone we hang out with may let our relationship slip to the wrong person and it would get back to his close friends, and they would be even more angry that he lied to them and tried to hide it. He told me not to be ridiculous, and said he would tell his friends. I made him promise not to, because I already know what will happen if he does. And he asked if I was okay with it, and I said yes (I lied, but he has no idea despite the fact that we have had several fights over it now). He said okay and told me to tell him if it ever did start to bother me (which I can't exactly do, because every time I do bring it up, he gets upset, and says he'll tell his friends when they're ready) 

I'm not sure how to move forward from here..

t3_dlrld1,Partner (29M) got one of his extended family to shave his head. Surprise to me when him &amp; I (27F) had discussed us doing together as was a big thing. Am I overreacting?,"Throwaway as detail is a bit of a giveaway.

So long term partner (5yrs) has had thinning hair and been receding for a while and talked about shaving his head at some point but ummed and ahhed. Quite a symbolic big move for him, having had long hair for years prior. He has quite a distinct shaped head/facial profile so it also would look VERY different.

His mum (who he lives with) and grandmother were very much against this whenever he deliberated the idea.

He bought the razor and when shaving off came up in conversation with Mum I declined taking sides but said I was used to his hair. In retrospect BF says I should have 'supported him rather than sided with his mum'. my view is  and I said to him was it's your head, do what you want. Not my place to argue over it with MIL?

He's been talking about taking the plunge for years and how I'd help him shave it initially, we were about to on Sunday but I suggested it might be a good idea to 'prep' his mum and we could do it together later in the week.

So I come back from work today, he messages me that he needs 'help evening out his hair after brother in law cut it'. There's nothing to thin out, it's all shaved off.

I felt weirdly  hurt as it was a big symbolic thing we were going to do together and he's gone and asked extended family to do it with NO warning. No meetings at work or functions to prep for, just did it whilst I was at work. 

When I was a bit down about it he got annoyed and said I wasn't being supportive and was a negative influence. That he gave me the chance at the weekend but 'unlike his sister and BIL I didn't have the balls to stand up to his mums view'. I dont know why the sister needs to endorse it really.

t3_dlrix6,I don't know whether I should pursue a girl...,"Obligatory Throwaway account because all my mates follow my main reddit account. English is not my native language, so excuse the awkward phrasing.

Anyway, me and this girl both go to the same university. We live in the same flat and see each other on a daily basis. We study the same subjects and have many overlapping lectures throughout the week. We get along well.

When I first met her around a month and a half ago, I really did not think much of it. I had just gotten out of a 2-year relationship with my ex, who had proven to be extremely selfish. Truth be told, the prospect of even doing anything with a girl was not even in my mind at that point, since starting Uni was an equally exciting and daunting event in my life. Since then I have grown quite fond of her. I normally wouldn't worry about this because I think I should let things take their course. 

However, she is desperate about getting a boyfriend. By her own admission, she feels lonely, so she probably feels a boyfriend would help fill that void. It is literally the main motivation she has to go outside partying with our group. Me and some of her other friends have had to take her away from clubs multiple times because she attracts the wrong type of attention from guys that are way too creepy (We've literally been followed back home by a 30-year+ old guy, who attempted to break into the common area of our flat with a crowbar). I can get a bit wild when I've had a bit too much to drink, but she gets drunk with the express purpose of getting with a random guy for the night, and taking it from there. (By get, I mean make out. As far as I can tell, she hasn't had sex with anyone just yet).

I don't know whether I should pursue her in the long run. I feel like she is a great girl and that getting together would be great. If it isn't meant to be, then that's also perfectly fine. A lot of my flatmates jokingly suggest that we should be a couple behind her back, and I always disregard their comments as teasing, but its gotten to the point where I've started thinking. I feel like she might deserve better, and that at the moment she is just confused. I've had many oppurtunities to make a move when we were both drunk, but every time I stop myself because I think I would be taking advantage of her. I don't want to start any relationship, even if it is just a casual fling, by taking advantage of someone's moment of weakness. I think that is wrong.

t3_dlrhrr,My (24F) BFF's (24F) new boyfriend (35M) is showing major red flags. How do I show her without ruining our friendship?,"My best friend (A) hasn't had the best of luck with relationships. She jumped from abusive ex to abusive ex and finally, a few years ago, became single and started to learn how to love herself and be independent. She's been with other partners since her relationships, but never in more than a casual dating type of way. These guys weren't necessarily the best, but I believe everyone has their flaws and she was super great at cutting them off when she didn't like the direction the relationship was going or they did a big oopsie (she's grown a lot in that aspect and I'm so proud of her). 

We live really far away from each other now so I don't get to see her much in person or meet these men, I just get the stories. Today we FaceTime and she started telling me about this new guy (J) who she called her boyfriend. I thought that was weird because we'd just spoken not even 2 weeks ago and I'd never heard of the guy. She said they just met online. When I questioned why things were moving so fast, she just said it was because J was older and that's just where he was at this point in his life. She starts talking about how he's really goal oriented and everything she has been looking for in a man and then starts getting upset with me when I ask her for examples of these traits (ex: what about him makes you say he's goal orientated? And she seems unable to come up with an answer).  As she goes on she tells me a story about how they got in a small argument (my friend was upset over something not related to J and just not in a good mood but he took it as a sign she was angry with him) and when they got to the bar they were having dinner at, J pounded 6 beers and started talking about how sad A looked and how everyone in the bar was looking at her and thinking that she was upset with him (ok fucking weirdo). He remained upset about this until they went back to A's apartment where they had sex. Immediately afterwards, J is trying to get dressed talking about how A clearly doesn't want him there after how she treated him earlier in the day. 

This story immediately screams ""red flag"" to me  and after a few more questions A starts opening up more about J. The first time they met, they hung out for a bit during the day, then they left the date and A went to have dinner with her sister, J texted her during dinner and asked if he could see her again later that night (he had seen her literally 3 hours ago. Also J lives a 45 min drive away).Apparently he's already been asking her about moving in with him (again, they've known each other less than 2 weeks). He's been making her feel guilty for having male friends (including her roommate and a close friend she's had for at least half a decade that has strictly been platonic). Then to top it off, dude has been saying it's strange for her to want to spend time apart from him. 

At this point I'm thinking this guy is full on nuts, I make a joke about how J sounds like the type of guy to chain someone in his basement. A laughs but I can tell she's not really feeling me making fun of this guy. She goes on by saying that he's just much older than her and is at a different point in his life which is why he's acting this way (which is strange because he's acting like a 14 year old kid in my eyes). I believe she's making excuses for him because she is a little insecure in not having her life together yet while he does and a slight power dynamic that causes her to think she doesn't deserve a significant other like that. I give up on trying to call out red flags and telling her this guy is one big ""hell fucking no"" and try to offer some real advice. I tell her she need to focus on positive reinforcement, since he goes into a full blown pity party anytime she acknowledges his bad behavior. I said that she should tell him ""hey I really enjoy spending time with you, but I can't miss you when I'm with you all the time. Sometimes I just need a second to focus on myself and get excited for when I see you next. I really appreciate when you understand that I need my alone time to get prepared for the week and make sure all my stuff is taken care of."" Make him focus on how he should be acting towards her if he really wants to make her happy. So we end the FaceTime with her promising she's going to keep me updated with how he responds. The following are the texts:

J: ""I already know what this means when your girl tells you she needs space and it's nothing good it's basically the beginning of the end.""

A: ""In order for fires to burn they need oxygen or you'll suffocate it and the flames will go out.""

J: ""All these metaphors are nice but I get the message. I'm giving you your space, taking a giant step back. We will see if it's beneficial.""

J: ""I don't need space. I need a woman to love me 24/7.""

To me it seems like he needs a woman he can guilt trip 24/7 because he's a fucking loser. I'm just at a loss for how to respond, A and I have grown distant before because I didn't think she was dating a very good guy (who ended up being physically abusive) and I'm worried she would let our friendship drift again if I push too hard on this dude being crazy. I'm not sure what to do to help her see the light. No matter what way I look at it, guy seems like bad news.

TL;DR: best friend in a brand new relationship with a guy who is guilt tripping her into: never getting upset, not having male friends, moving in with him (after 2 weeks), and not being able to have alone time.",relationship_advice

t3_dlrf5s,Considering breaking my co-worker rule,"This is a bit of a novel, so sorry in advanceüò¨ TL;DR at the end.

I started working at a new company almost 5 months ago and I felt like it took me awhile to feel comfortable there. I'm pretty introverted and I work in a department with a lot of extroverts. The guy in question works in the same department that I do, but I don't really work with him directly but we do share an open office space so I see him a lot throughout the day. I've always had a hard rule against dating co-workers and it's never been an issue until now.  The first couple of months, I didn't really pay him much attention.  He's outgoing and attractive but I just kept to myself and thought nothing of it. I had never even talked to him until nearly 4 months into working there.  

About two months into the job, I actually had a dream with him in it (lol which was super weird considering we had never had a conversation before). In the dream we were interested in each other but neither one of us wanted to take the step to actually confess our feelings. The dream ended when I got a message from him saying that it was clear we liked each other so why not just go for it. My dream self was like ""hell yeah, get it girl"" and we started dating.  But when I woke up, I was *very* confused. For a couple of weeks after the dream I felt kinda weird around him, but still hadn't spoken to him. Fast forward about a month later, and things are back to normal, I didn't think much of it and had mostly forgotten about the dream.

Then last month, I noticed a shift in things.  He complimented my outfit one day and the week following that, I noticed he went out of his way more to come by my desk or it seemed he'd go out of his way to talk to me and joke around with me.  During a span of a week and a half, I started noticing him more: what his interests were, how he was well liked in the department.  We had a lot more similarities than I thought and he was fun to talk to despite my growing nerves around him.  Before I knew it, I had caught feelings. 

I went on a trip for nearly two weeks after all these interactions and during that time we followed each other  on social media.  It's been three weeks since getting back from my trip and I'm kind of at a lost on what to do. 

I know I get really nervous around him sometimes (or all the time haha) and being in a work environment when our other coworkers are constantly around is hard.  I don't feel like I can fully flirt and be myself; almost like I'm under a microscope and I don't want my other co-workers being suspicious. We have good moments of flirting (as much as you can get away with in a corporate office) and we talk occasionally outside of work on Instagram. But I noticed he's not great at carrying on a conversation on there, though he often initiates them.  There are signs that he's interested: if our other co-workers aren't around at the end of the day, he'll wait around for me and we'll walk out of the office together, I catch him watching me often, he'll compliment me but seems a bit nervous around me at the same time, he says flirty things that I have never heard him say to other female co-workers.  

He's pretty extroverted, but I wonder if he has the same hesitations that I do.  Because of my hesitations, I feel as though I come off as uninterested at times when I'm just trying to be nonchalant.  To be honest, I feel as though I'm living out my dream in real time now and I'm too unsure to move forward.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR- two months into a new job, I had a dream my coworker and I were interested in each other and started dating despite never talking to each other. About three months later, we started talking and I've noticed signs of interest on his end and I'm now interested, just unsure how to move forward with things given my previous rule against dating co-workers.",relationship_advice
t3_dlkyii,I (M27) have just been told she (F24) wants to stop dating. I‚Äôm genuinely crushed about it.,"We‚Äôve been dating for a good few months and it‚Äôs been going perfect, we‚Äôve even mentioned the future about plans etc and that we would make a great couple. 

To make this short as possible, rewind to last Sunday we went on a date, best date by far. Was amazing, she said it was the best she‚Äôs ever been on. 
I seen her again Monday evening and this is where it went downhill. Her texts were getting less frequent, it just seemed off to me and my gut was telling me something was wrong. I ignored my gut and thought this would pass. 
Throughout the week it was still there and i began to worry. 
We arranged to see each other Saturday night just gone, we enjoyed ourselves but she didn‚Äôt seem herself from the get go. Was quieter than usual, less touchy with me and overall less chatty. I thought it was because she was shattered, she had a really long day in work so I put it down to that. 
We end the night back at hers, still acting the same, I leave and let her get some sleep. We keep kissing and have a fairly lengthy hug and she asks when am I seeing her next, I said I‚Äôll sort it out. I drive home. 

On my drive home I‚Äôm constantly feeling this gut feeling that it‚Äôs wrong she‚Äôs behaving weird with me so I text her Sunday evening. 
Worst news came back, she said my feelings were right. She just started seeing differences in our personalities etc and said although they was good it was different levels. No idea what she means by that but fair enough I take it. She said her mind was mashed over this and thought it was her being stupid, she said she wanted to see me on the date we had Saturday to see if her feelings would change. She said they didn‚Äôt. Something has changed in her head and she doesn‚Äôt understand it, she said she‚Äôs not 100% and I understand you shouldn‚Äôt follow a relationship if your not 100%. Her exact words were ‚Äúrelationships should be 100% or nothing. Seeing you Saturday didn‚Äôt change that and it hurts to say that‚Äù. I accepted it but I‚Äôm crushed. 

We‚Äôve had our take care texts I don‚Äôt think she will reply back to my last one I presume it‚Äôs done.
I‚Äôm so upset over this, I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend because I was developing really strong feelings towards her, she was the most exciting girl I‚Äôve ever been around. 
I tried to focus my attention on things I enjoy such as the gym and that even feels a chore now. I had such a crap workout I couldn‚Äôt focus, all that has been on my mind is her, whys? And what ifs?

Did I fall in love!? It‚Äôs such a short time for it to happen I imagine but I feel sick. I can‚Äôt really eat and I actually cried twice over this. 
I just want to drive to her house and fix it but i won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs done I won‚Äôt contact her again. The thought of moving on to meet another girl actually scares me. I wanted her and her only. 

I told her how I feel and she already knew I was having strong feelings for her we spoke about it a few weeks ago and she agreed she was having the same feelings, she said she was expecting a relationship to come of this but why after a few months can your mind change!? 

I treated her amazing in her words ‚Äúyou‚Äôve treated me better than I ever could have imagined, I feel lucky to have even ever dated you. Your the nicest lad I actually know‚Äù. 

I just don‚Äôt understand, my mind is going a million miles per hour and I can‚Äôt stop looking at her social media. I‚Äôm just waiting for this imaginary text to say she wants to try and make this work now her head has cleared. 

This is embarrassing because it‚Äôs only been a few months but I can‚Äôt help how I feel, has this happened to anyone else? 
Thank you guys, I know I blabbed on way too much.",relationship_advice
t3_dlpo96,I (F16) has a mother (F35) who constantly tears me down,"I‚Äôm just going to get right into this

I‚Äôm going to start off by saying my mother , other than the fact that she‚Äôs an asshole at times , is an amazing person. She would go to great lengths for my siblings and I and I appreciate all she has done for me. 

But to be quite frank, I‚Äôm done with her bullshit. What she said to me today was the last straw. 

My mam always makes comments about me that aren‚Äôt nice whatsoever. She likes to take the piss all the time and constantly picks on me. She always looks for something to give out about. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt look the way she wished I did. I‚Äôm not exactly the skinniest, I have stretch marks on my arms and a few on my hips, a few scars from a wild but amazing childhood that are visible and I don‚Äôt have a big bum , which to her seems like a massive issue. I‚Äôm trying to love myself but she always tears me down. 

She makes jokes about me to her friends and then LAUGHS with her friends about it , she says things that cause me to not feel comfortable enough to wear a SHIRT at home , she constantly compares my body to hers when she was a teenager because apparently she used to be perfect and of course compares me to my friends. she pretty much tells me I‚Äôm ugly all day every day. I cannot do anything without being judged. My dad is no better either.

Because of the way my mam treats me , my siblings think it‚Äôs okay to say those things to me too and they‚Äôre all younger than me. It‚Äôs one thing to hear it from mam and dad but when the whole family is bad mouthing you , it‚Äôs so difficult to ignore it. 

Today , I walked into the kitchen to make a cup of tea because I had a sore throat and needed something hot and she just decides to say ‚Äúwith those stretch marks on your arms and stomach *shakes head* when you get married , your husband is going to see them and say what the fuck did I marry ?‚Äù and then she laughed. 

My mental heath was already in a bad place so it was.
So I turned off the kettle , took a Strepsil from the cupboard and went upstairs. I went into my room and just thought ‚Äú what the actual hell‚Äù to myself. my mam has said lots of things to me , but this was an all time low. Why would she say that out of nowhere? She‚Äôs going to drive me to suicide. I‚Äôve been trying to better myself for a while now and she just made me feel like it wasn‚Äôt worth it at all. I realised the reason I never got with any lads was because of the things she said. She made me paranoid and scared of being judged the way she judged me. Home is such a toxic environment. I hate it here. I can‚Äôt be myself , I can‚Äôt love myself and I can‚Äôt do things for myself. I‚Äôm always the bad guy. I know I‚Äôm just rumbling on but I‚Äôm just a mess. 

I need to get out of here. Where should I go? I‚Äôm not contacting socials. I just need to leave. I know it might sound dramatic but I‚Äôve been dealing with this since 8yrs old. It‚Äôs damaged me too much mentally. People have it worse , I know. But my situation should be taken just as serious. 

Any advice on what to do ? Speaking to my parents about how they‚Äôre treating me won‚Äôt do anything for me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlervx,"My bf(30m) suggested threesome, now I(25f) want to explore my sexuality.","First of all, I want to say I'm truly thankful for all the people who gave me advice on my last post - I read through all the comments and they're all very helpful. (Btw here's the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dff1v5/nsfw_my_bf_wants_to_watch_me_sleep_with_other_men/) )

Long story short, I gave it bit research and found out that IT IS a common kink/sexual fantasy - so no need to freak out, I just need to make sure there's no porn addiction issue with my bf. 

Last week I sat down and talked to him. It was a very calm and non-judgemental conversation, where my bf apologized for freaking me out and then told me that he never wanted to cheat, that he's not gay or bi, it's just that he found the idea of seeing me have sex with someone else(could be either a guy or a girl) WHILE he's there very, very hot. He also reassured me that he doesn't have a porn addiction. From my previous observation for the past 6 months, I don't think he's obsessed with porn either. So after all, it's a harmless sexual fantasy of his, is all. Then my bf went on saying that it's ok for me to find the idea disgusting and not willing to participate. I told him that it's totally fine to have fantasies like this and I respect that - we can explore things together as long as it's consensual; that I'm not down for a threesome YET but I'm not 100% opposed to the idea and given time it might grow on me.

My bf was really happy about it and said that I can take my time to think this through, and if I ever want to willingly do this we can have another talk - also I can get to choose if the third party is male or female, a total stranger or someone we know. 

Now it's been a few days since our last conversation. Although my bf didn't bring up the topic again, I myself can't stop thinking about it. I watched a few porns about threesomes, 2guys1girl, as well 2girls1guy. Much to my surprise I was WAY more aroused by the latter one, especially when I saw the actions between the two girls. I then moved on to watch a few lesbian porns.. Well what can I say -I liked them too. 

I grew up in a conservative Asian family and I have never seen myself as anything other than a straight woman for the past 25 years of my life. I've dated only male and I do believe I'm attracted to men. Now I am not so sure.

A little part of me wants to use the threesome as an opportunity to explore my sexuality. I can make out with a girl to see if I actually enjoy it. Would it be unfair for my bf? Should I talk to him about this uncertain sexuality thing first? What if it turns out that I AM bisexual? 

This is a great relationship that I don't want to risk, but the idea is now stuck in my mind...

I meet people I like but I don't really recall how to make friends or how I used to make friends back in grade school. I don't know how to grow a new group of friends or how to find people with my interests.

t3_dlr8d2,My (F21) boyfriend (M30) gave me a birthday present,"My boyfriend is the kindest human being. We‚Äôve been together for about two years now, we live together, have talked about marriage and kids, this is my person and I want to spend my life with him and only him. 

Let me start this off this story by how sentimental I am. I love everything that has meaning and I do stupid things just out of the kindness of my heart. I‚Äôm the biggest gift giver. I‚Äôll buy him anything and everything and the same isn‚Äôt really reciprocated but I‚Äôm okay with that because my love is just so grand for this man where I don‚Äôt think twice about my purchases. 

My birthday is in two weeks and I have been curious as to what we are doing that day and I can‚Äôt wait for it. We got an amazon prime package this morning and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúthis is it, this is your birthday gift‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúooooh, this is the gift, eh? I can‚Äôt wait‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really bad at keeping surprises, I want to give it to you now!‚Äù 

My only response was well if I open it now the day of my birthday I will not look forward to open anything. Let‚Äôs save the surprise for my birthday!‚Äù He then disregarded that comment and opened it and showed me and to my surprise it‚Äôs a case for my phone. It‚Äôs a pink case. I of course exclaimed how cute it is and how much I loved it. I had thanked him and hugged him. 

Deep down I really feel like there‚Äôs no thought in this birthday gift. And if there was thought, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but thought means wrapping it up in something cute like a gift bag maybe some tissue paper to show effort no matter what the gift is. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is effort and I‚Äôm not finding it. 

I told my best friend about this and she said that I‚Äôm shallow and how a gift is meaningful no matter what it is and you know maybe that‚Äôs right.

This is completely inappropriate, I feel like. He‚Äôs still a new supervisor, I‚Äôve been working at my job for nearly 3 years and he‚Äôs only been there less than a year and started right off as a supervisor. Sometimes I feel like he‚Äôs flirting with me when we talk, but that could just be in my head. There are other couples at my job and there was one that was similar(same position as me and him) as me and this supervisor but they were married before they started working so not really the same. Should I even attempt to actually make an effort into flirting to see if something is there or no because of how inappropriate it is? I don‚Äôt think either of us would lose our job, but with my job it could put our primary(and secondary) customers at risk. He is in charge of how the product is made and I make sure the product is good enough for our customers, if it isn‚Äôt, then we essentially lose money as a whole. I don‚Äôt know exactly what all happens when a supervisors product is consistently not up to standards but I probably put the product ‚Äúout of grade‚Äù the most in my department. We run 4-5 different types of product at the same time and we have different supervisors for each respective product.

t3_dlpct3,My friend got a new boyfriend and has gone MIA,"I am (20f) and my friend is (19f). We have been friends since middle school. We were both apart of the same big group of friends all through out middle to high school and during her sophomore year she got a boyfriend who she dated for 3 years. At first she still came around and hung out with everyone and her boyfriend would hang out too but then slowly as time went on she started to become more and more distant. She also had a falling out with one of the girls in our friend group and never came around much after that and only sat with us at lunch and would associate with us at school but rarely ever outside of school. Anytime I would ask her to hang out or anyone would include her in plans she never answered or had an excuse or said that her boyfriend didn‚Äôt want to go so she didn‚Äôt want to. So the last two years of me being in high school with her I wasn‚Äôt very close to her and didn‚Äôt have much of a relationship with her outside of school.  

Fast forward to last year her boyfriend and her broke up once she went off to college, she then started to come out of her shell more and actually was wanting to do things and was putting herself out there to reconnect with some of her friends including me. Her and I were able to get really close again and had a much better relationship. She even vented to me that she was happy that she ended the relationship because she was actually able to be free and do her thing and not miss out on spending time with friends, she even acknowledged the fact that she would just sit at her boyfriends house all day and not do anything and that she followed everything he did. I was so proud of her for realizing that and actually wanting to break from those habits and find herself, she was doing so well and was really thriving. Everytime we hung out she always was so much fun and we always had the best time, she also was a really good friend to me and always let me know that she was there for me and that she loved me. 

Fast forward to this past summer she met a guy one night when her and I went out and things between them moved pretty fast two weeks into them knowing each other he was already staying the night at her house and they started hanging out with each other everyday. 3 weeks into them getting to know each other they made it official. I wasn‚Äôt ever able to go to her house or spend time with her without him having to be there too. Her mood also changed as well she went from being super optimistic and wanting to go and do everything to not wanting to do anything and always being in a bad mood. She also went from texting me everyday and always wanting to hang out to barley even speaking to me. It started to really annoy me and I tried my best to be happy for her cause he‚Äôs a good guy but I just felt like things were moving so fast paced and that I was kind of being put on the back burner. They both also go to colleges that are within like a hour from each other so they‚Äôre constantly going back and forth to each other‚Äôs schools and they both come home and visit every weekend and only hang with each other, she doesn‚Äôt ever have the decency to tell me that she‚Äôs in town I always have to find out later on when I‚Äôm on Snapchat. 

I just feel like she‚Äôs back to square 1 with exactly how she was with her first boyfriend and it‚Äôs like when she‚Äôs dating someone she makes that person her only priority and doesn‚Äôt have time for friends anymore. It‚Äôs like pulling teeth to get her to even go to lunch with you and she always has some sort of excuse. I just don‚Äôt understand what it is and I‚Äôve just stopped trying because I‚Äôm honestly hurt.",relationship_advice
t3_dlr4jt,Sometimes I (26M) don't have anything new to say to my long distance GF (25F). How can I stay in touch better?,"So some background: we started dating a few years ago when we lived in the same city, but a few months into that she got a job that took her across the country. So, since we had only been together for a few months anyway we decided to call it quits with no hard feelings and stayed in touch. Eventually though I ended up developing some real feelings for her; and when I told her how I felt she told me that she felt the same way. So I started visiting her every other month or so and we decided to make it a long distance thing until I finish school and can move. Conservatively speaking I probably won't be able to move until June so we still have a few months to go; and to make up for it we try to spend a lot of time on the phone, but to be honest I just run out of things to say sometimes. It was fine for awhile but after I really buckled down my life is basically 50% school and 50% work so there's not much new things going on. I'm happy to hear about how her life is going but I feel bad anytime I have to just say ""same old, same old"" whenever she asks me the same.

t3_dl3q0c,My husband (m25) cheated on me (f24) a year ago. I decided to stay. He‚Äôs done a 180 and is everything I ever needed before. But does this pain ever end?,"I apologize in advance if my grammar isn‚Äôt on point. 
My husband cheated on me with his ex wife about a year ago. I was pregnant at the time. His ex wife reached out to me and told me everything in detail.

He finally admitted everything to me when I would over analyze and break it down to him how his story wouldn‚Äôt make sense. I decided to try to forgive him and stay because I was very deeply in love with him and he was showing remorse. I also have a daughter with him and I wanted her to not have a broken household. My husband has done a complete 180. He‚Äôs being the best husband he can be and the best father. He‚Äôs the most affectionate he‚Äôs ever been, he‚Äôs been working on building that trust with me, and he is so so good  with our daughter. He‚Äôs doing everything he can to save our marriage and family but it‚Äôs just me. I still haven‚Äôt forgiven him. I think about what he did daily. It‚Äôs very hard to believe in him and trust him when he lied to me for so long. My self esteem is on the floor. When he tries to make love to me, I imagine him and his ex wife.

t3_dlr3xp,"I(22f) am stuck in a casual relationship, which I want to make exclusive (but afraid to do that)","Recently got out of a long term relationship with a person I thought I‚Äôd marry. Met someone very shortly after that, we hit it off; both sort of decided that we will be simultaneously seeing other people. 

Once month in, I discover that he is actually actively going on dates. We talk about it, he handles it very well and calls me down. I see other people. Two months in, I realize that other people don‚Äôt really do it for me. For him, it still seems to be going well (from the looks of it). 

The situation reached its peak last week when his phone broke, and he didn‚Äôt get back to me about our weekend plans for about a day. In my head, I overthought it to the point where I thought that he went on a date, which went really well and he stayed over someone else‚Äôs apartment (he used to put his phone on airplane mode when we first started seeing each other, and would leave it like that for hours). That turned out not to be the case, but made me realize how much I actually care about what‚Äôs going on between us. 

Our relationship doesn‚Äôt revolve around sex. We still go on dates, take walks in the evening, text throughout the week. Recently he started asking me to stay over (I live very close). We have a good connection, and everything seems to be going well all in all. 

This relationship was supposed to be fun and carefree, but I realize I am too invested to the point where I get hurt thinking about him sleeping with other women. Or even being interested in them. I am afraid that if I bring it up, and say that I don‚Äôt really want to stay casual anymore, he will end things. 

How should I approach it? Should I even mention it or let things take its course? What would you do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlr2ny,"Females that I fall for don't like me, but the girls I don't like fall for me?","I'll attempt to keep this as simple as possible. I am a 29 year old man, I have a stable job, a budding career, my own house and I keep myself in really great shape. I love being me, and I'm completely content with the person that I am. I have allot going for me right now. 

I'm here because the one area that I struggle with is my dating life. Not that I struggle to find dates, or even the general lack of female attention. My problem seems to be much more psychological than I even know. When I was 24 years old I fell in love with a beautiful young woman, and we ended up getting close to engaged. Yet, one thing lead to another and she ended up leaving me. Didn't give me a reason as to why, or even the courtesy of letting me know that what we had was over. I spent around 2 years in a state of utter misery, and wasted allot of my time. 

This all changed in 2017 when I met a girl, we started talking, and eventually started dating. It was fine, she was fun to hang out with and decent company. Over time though I began to realize that I didn't want to be with her. All the while she was falling head over heals in love with me. Fawning over me, and planning out our lives together. It was around a year and half into our relationship when anther young girl came into my life. Nothing happened with this girl, I never cheated with her, and I continued to date my current girlfriend even though my heart told me differently.  Eventually I had enough and broke things off with the first girl. I waited a few weeks and started casually dating this other girl. Funny story, the same exact thing happened as before.I realized the girl wasn't right for me and after a year I decided it was time to end things with her. All while this girl fell head over heals in love with me, started planning out lives together and couldn't see herself with any other guy. 

This brings us to current day. Currently, I am dating a new girl whom I am head over heels in love with, yet I get the feeling that she doesn't feel quite the same way as i do. I can hardly go a period of time without thinking about her, and I am constantly worried and nervous she will end things with me. I have even thought about just ending things with her because I can't handle the anticipation of her breaking up with me. It's not like she has ever really given me any strong inclinations that something may be wrong but I just feel like it might end. I don't know if its paranoia or if there is something there?

I gues my question is, why does it seem that the girls that I don't really care for end up falling madly in love with me, I could do the worst things to them (I didn't) and they wouldn't even care, as long as I stayed in their lives. There have been two now, two that I didn't really care for and both of them fell head over heals in love with me. Yet these two other girls, whom I fall deeply in love with......just don't have the same connection as I do. I'm just so utterly confused and it seems like I can't hit the mark. Is there some subliminal mental blockage that I'm missing?",relationship_advice
t3_dlr0iq,Kinda sorta friends with benefits but not anymore?,"I'm only a sixteen years old boy in highschool and there's this girl I was sort of an unofficial thing with.

I talked to her about it, and she said she was still interested in me, but wanted to take things slow all the sudden, but I was fine with it because I really like her. She got even more distant and I talked to her about it a week later. Same answer, only after that she would ignore me or give me one word answers. I've been avoiding her and giving her space and it seems to be helping some.

t3_dlqzbw,My (20F) boyfriends (21M) dick is kinda small. Is this a big deal?,"Soooo I‚Äôm a virgin, my boyfriend isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve watched porn before which I know is nothing like real sex but I have some knowledge I guess, I‚Äôm not completely clueless. He never really mentioned anything about his dick size before like he wasn‚Äôt like oh it‚Äôs so big it‚Äôs huge and he never said it was small or anything. 

Anyway we still didn‚Äôt have sex, but today I gave him a handjob /blowjob. Kind of late but he never pressured me or asked for anything so we kind of took things really slow. (Unrelated but he‚Äôs very generous, he‚Äòs also the first guy who went down on me and whoaaaa you guys. lol) Anyway so we started and he was kind of smaller than I‚Äôve seen in porn. I didn‚Äôt say anything about it and I just told him that I was nervous and excited because I was lol and he was really sweet. It was maybe like 3 or 4 inches? I‚Äôm not really good with measurements. But it was like I wrapped my hand around it and I couldn‚Äôt really move it up and down like I‚Äôve seen in porn since there was nothing else. If that makes sense. So that was a bit confusing since I didn‚Äôt know what to do lol 

But anyway this is kind of weird to ask, but is it possible to have sex with him even if he‚Äôs small or will it not go in?? Another thing is that idk a ton of girls always talk about dick size and like that‚Äôs a requirement. Is that true?? Like is it a big deal like that?? He‚Äôs a great boyfriend and I wouldn‚Äôt break up over sex/dick size but I‚Äôm just wondering is it something most girls would see as a deal breaker?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqzai,"I (28M) am in one of my first relationships (25F). I have just recently quit pot. Should I tell her now, and if so how?","I‚Äôve been smoking cannabis daily for a couple of years until fairly recently. It was a problem, and conensided with my depression. I was secretive about my smoking and I never told anyone about it.

This new girl is one of my first relationships, and the first woman I‚Äôve slept with. She‚Äôs made me happier than I‚Äôve been in a long time, and I believe I make her happy too. Shortly after we started going out I quit smoking pot, happiness and sex are surprisingly good motivators.

We‚Äôve now been seeing each other for 2 months, I‚Äôve been completely clean for nearly 4 weeks, which is a big thing for me. I feel I should tell her about it, but am scared to do so.

t3_dlqyov,Someone spread rumours about me in my new job and I think I'm going to quit,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, so let me know if it's not and I'll remove it.

I started a retail job recently enough and have been working my ass off, I have bruises literally all over my body from the amount of hard work I put in (also I bruise very easily).  I've always been a hard worker, always have and always will make sure I do everything I can to complete a task to the best of my abilities.

I'm extremely shy, and have extreme social anxiety, so getting this job was a big step for me, and I rarely spoke to anyone, let alone complain.  I just want in, did my job and came home.

I walked into work the other day and a manager asked to speak to me and said someone spoke to him about me and stuff I've been saying. It was all a bunch of lies, saying I complained that one of my managers is gay, how the managers are horrible and unapproachable (I kept to myself, and therefore did not know enough to comment on anyone's traits, and even if I did, I would never say such things) and a bunch of other stuff.

So yeah.. I'm thinking of quitting because of it, because it's playing havock on my depression and anxiety and especially because when I explained to the manager that I would never say anything like that, and basically just explained that I'm a very shy person and would never ever say or do anything to hurt a person, it didn't seem like he believed me.

I have a strong feeling I know who made up the rumours about me, and the reason I think it's this person is because they are constantly saying that stuff to me, so I have a feeling they said I was the one saying it because they were scared I would say something, but I don't know. 

I haven't been in work since it happened, and I can feel myself reverting back into my depressive and anxious state, which I have just recently started learning to deal with.

What do you think? Should I quit?",relationship_advice

t3_dlqwzq,My (25F) girlfriend wanted a break with me (27M),"Hello! My ex girlfriend at the time was dating me for about 9 months when she told me in person that she was not happy with anything in life because of her depression, including our relationship, and wanted to take a break for a few months at the beginning of October. I told her why do we need a break and why can we not work on it together but she seemed so confused in her decision. Then I brought up the promise ring I had gotten for her a few months into our relationship and she asked if she could return it. I told her it sounds like she doesn't want to take a break but to actually break up but she insisted that she just needed some time to herself mostly because of the depression. I advised her to hide the ring or throw it away since it seemed like she was hinting more towards a breakup by asking if she could return the ring. Initially I went along with her taking a break stance on our relationship and agreed. She said by January she will let me know where she stands in life and our relationship. Two days later she texted me and told me that the past few days have been very hard on her and she wanted to apologize if her actions have ever hurt me before in my life. She was acting cold in the past few weeks leading up to the talk we had where she would randomly get upset at me in person over something completely not my fault or just act cold or distant, things that she believes were as a result of her depression. 

After four days of our talk, I decided that I do not want to sit idle for three months when there is always the chance that this break could just be a facade for a break up... so I texted her that we should go our separate ways and that this is taking a toll on me mentally already and that I love her and can't imagine if she tells me she doesn't want me in her life in January. I would have to heal twice. She agreed to break up. I advised her to seek therapy for her depression and she seemed very receptive to my advice.

Fast forward to approximately 10 days after she and I talked about taking a break, she texted me with some small talk banter after I tried to go no contact on her. Then she said ""btw I decided to seek help from a psychologist and you were the biggest reason as to why I did. Thank you for so being so understanding and amazing. Everytime I speak to the psychologist and almost everyday I wear the promise ring and looking at it makes me sooooo happy. I already feel mentally better after speaking to this psychologist."" She also asked about my mom and said she wanted to call my mom because she wanted to say hi to her but wasn't sure if my mom was told our relationship situation yet. My mom and her normally talk about twice a month on the phone and my ex gf told me during the ""lets take a break talk"" that she still wanted to talk to me and my mom no matter the outcome of the situation. 

As you could imagine, after reading her text message about the promise ring, I was so hurt. I don't know why she felt the need to bring up the fact that she wears my promise ring daily but a month before the breakup I noticed she stopped wearing it completely when I was around. Is she trying to mess with me by texting me this stuff? How should I proceed forward? I don't know what I am supposed to do if she texts me again or what her end goal is since we decided to break up. I also do not know if her depression is just a front for her true feelings of wanting to breakup...",relationship_advice
t3_dllnpk,My 10 year old daughter says she is a boy. Where do we go from here?,"Hi there. I‚Äôll try to make this as short and simple as I possibly can. 

My daughter is currently in 5th grade. She‚Äôs always been a super bubbly, energetic girl. She dresses like any other 10 year old girl and has a ton of friends.

About a year ago, my wife playfully asked our daughter if she liked any boys at school. She told her that she did not like boys like that. No big deal. A few months later, my daughter told my wife that she had a crush on one of her best friends at school, who happened to be a girl. We laughed it off at first, thinking that our daughter didn‚Äôt realize what a ‚Äòcrush‚Äô or ‚Äòbeing in love‚Äô was. 

However, she soon began making comments about how she wanted to kiss her friend and become her girlfriend. We both found it odd initially, but we came to the conclusion that had she been talking about a boy in the same sense, it would be considered ‚Äòharmless‚Äô and completely normal. We soon came to the conclusion that our daughter was gay. 

About a month back, my younger daughter, who is 6, told my wife that she saw her older sister going through our closet. She was trying on some of my clothes and spraying my cologne onto her body. At this point, my wife and I sat down for a serious talk. We wanted to figure out what was going on but at the same time we wanted to let our daughter ‚Äòexplore‚Äô without fully interfering. We mutually agreed that we would sit her down and talk about how it‚Äôs ok to be different and assure her that we would always support her. 

During that talk, my daughter reiterated that she was into girls and not boys. She then told us that she wants to become a boy. She told us that she began to question her gender 2 years ago. Through the internet, she found out what being transgender means. She told us it all made sense when she read about it. We both told her that we would absolutely go along with her transition if that was truly the way she felt. 

Over the next few weeks, my daughter has begun the ‚Äòtransition‚Äô already. She has slowly started dressing more masculine and told me she wants her hair cut short like mine. She has a very feminine first name, so she has asked if we could change it. As puberty looms, she has already told us that she wants reassignment surgery. Her breast have already started growing and she says it‚Äôs making her insecure. 

We told our daughter to take it slowly, but obviously she is ready to do this after years of confusion and silence in fear that we would go against her wishes. According to my daughter, she has told her friends that she is transitioning. She said most of them didn‚Äôt even know what that meant, but that they all thought it was ‚Äòcool‚Äô. She continues to have a massive crush on her friend and told us that she wants to ask her out on a date to the school dance in December. 

So...

Are we doing the right thing here? How long do I wait before consulting a doctor about a sex change operation? How do I tell my super religious, bigoted parents about this? Is it ok to feel sadness about ‚Äòlosing‚Äô my daughter even though I know this is what she wants? 

We are brand new to all of this so ANY advice would be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_dlquvf,Husband (32m) is telling me (31f) to cut ties with family but I can't do it,"So here is the deal: my family can be very nosy in my life and like to meddle in my business.  However, they're my family and I don't have friends (I suck at making friends plus I do not trust in people very much) so they're my only support system even though they're out of state.  

Why my husband wants me to do this? My mother and brother are insisting that I tie my tubes so I won't have more children (I have a seven year old with Aspergers).  You're wondering why they care about that. Me too, me too.  Trust me.

Also. My mother and sometimes my dad (they're divorced) meddle too much in how my husband and I should raise our son.  I'm fed up with that and if I try to put my foot down, they become passive-aggressive.  

My husband is sick of my family and how, according to him, I don't do anything to stop them.  I'd be good if they stop but they're my family.  What if my husband dumps me? If I cut my family I will be all alone in the world.  

How can I tell my family to stop being so nosy without cutting them off?

t3_dloyp0,[Update] My most complicated post,"I confessed to my close friend and got rejected a couple months ago. I figured I would especially since she has a boyfriend but it was eating away at me for so long so I still did it so I could find peace. From her reaction that night, it was clear she already knew I had feelings for her. She just told me that I have to move on and forget about her in that sort of way. I suppose a small part of me had hope for the little chance we‚Äôd get together afterwards so since I confessed, I‚Äôve been distant. Me, her and couple people are in a group and before I confessed, we all hung out a lot. It‚Äôs been some time since I confessed and since then, we all haven‚Äôt hung out. 

Nows for the complicated part. My close friend has a sister, we‚Äôll call her A. She became part of our group not too long ago. Theirs also a guy in our group, we‚Äôll call him B, and he was in a relationship with A. A broke up with B maybe a month after they went out because my close friend kept pestering them and for other reasons A told me. B and I have known eachother for a while but only started talking this summer. Ever since he met A, he‚Äôs been talking to me about her. About how much she means to him and what not. He still does this despite the fact they‚Äôve broken up 6 months ago. I‚Äôm pretty sure he was using me as an emotional sponge. We haven‚Äôt spoke in awhile now.

I also got close to A. In fact when I first met her, I was interested but because B was into her so I kept my distance. A couple months ago I went to see A after so long to say high and bye since I was sure I wasn‚Äôt going to see her again or atleast for a while. We ended up talking for a bit. She seemed really sad about me telling her I‚Äôm distancing myself. She kept demanding an answer and saying things like ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre the coolest one‚Äù. I said wouldn‚Äôt that be B and she said ‚Äúno it‚Äôs always been you‚Äù etc. 

From the vibe I kept picking up, it seems like she‚Äôs interested in me. I got that vibe even when I asked if I could see her from her response. I don‚Äôt want to be an ass however. I keep picturing being in B‚Äôs shoes and how it‚Äôll feel if someone I trusted went out with my ex I still have feelings for. A is very cool though and as it is, we get along great. I can see myself with her but B is the only thing stopping me especially since if I get with A, B will be even more heartbroken and the rest of our group will hate me. And my close friend will think I‚Äôm scum for going for her then her sister. Then again, everyone in that group is fake so I can live without them.

Me and A text eachother every now and then still. Today‚Äôs her birthday so I wished her happy birthday. She said thanks with heart emojis then a little later mentioned how she missed me. She also asked when I was going to tell her why I decided to cut out group off. I just changed the subject and wished her happy birthday again. 

I think I‚Äôm going to get her a gift next week and then tell her I like her... I just don‚Äôt know how to do it. I‚Äôm also afraid  to tell her about me confessing to her sister. 

Update: A and B went to a festival together a couple days ago. I completely forgot B told me he was going to invite A to the festival a couple months ago and I supported this decision. I forgot to mention earlier but I actually tried to help A and B back together after they broke up for 2 reasons. 1, I saw how miserable B was after the break up. 2, The good friend in me took over rather than the other side that wants B all to myself. They posted pictures from the festival online with some Disney song in the background. A had a girl singing the song and B had a guy. Very cute but not so  good for me.

Should I throw in the towel and let them be or shoot my shot anyways? There a small chance she just went with him to the festival as friends but their posts strongly disagree. I think my best bet would be to ask A or B what they are and go on from that. I was thinking of getting back into the group then asking A if she still like B. Depending on what she says, I‚Äôll move on from there but I really don‚Äôt want to get back into that group. Any advice on what I should do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqsxy,Trying to make things right before I let go,"Almost two weeks ago, my boyfriend broke up with me. It was absolutely the right move. I wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort into our relationship, and he called me out on it. Im extremely heartbroken (getting better every day) But I‚Äôm glad he stood up for himself. 

Since then, I‚Äôve made some serious changes. I immediately quit the video game I got seriously addicted to for almost a year (14 days now and feeling no urge to return) I got a job as a medical assistant (today was my 2nd day of training), I‚Äôve cooked 3 nights out of the week for two weeks (instead of never cooking), Ive done cardio workouts 4-5 times a week, I stopped regularly abusing my medication and now only take it as prescribed, I‚Äôm no longer procrastinating on house projects that need done (and the house has never been cleaner), and I‚Äôm reading through books on communication/relationships. In my spare time, I‚Äôm watching his favorite show that I Once said I wasn‚Äôt into (even though he watched all 6 seasons of *my* favorite show no questions asked). And no lie, I‚Äôm very much enjoying the show now. (I figure this might also help build rapport in our potential future) 

It‚Äôs been exhausting and difficult, but I‚Äôm getting through it. It‚Äôs probably the most extreme amount of change and work I‚Äôve ever gone through in such a short period of time. And it‚Äôs only just beginning. 

So yes, I‚Äôm doing all of this for *me.* But I‚Äôm also doing this as a *result* of what he said to me. ‚ÄúI want us working on ourselves...‚Äù he said. And so I‚Äôm doing that. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see *us* right now.‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt lie... I want my ex back.  Or at least, I want to see if the quality of our relationship would improve given these changes I‚Äôve strung together. Thanks to my ex, I‚Äôm no longer in a ‚Äútrance‚Äù by that video game, and the job would put him and I on an even playing field. (Our schedules would sync). The game and lack of work probably hurt our relationship the most. My priorities were a mess. 

I know it‚Äôs only been two weeks ‚Äî but I wanted to share this anyway.  Seems the art of seduction is subtle, and going to my Ex with a list of changes I‚Äôve just made will probably serve me no good. I know I have to wait until he contacts me... 

My question is.. do you think what I‚Äôm doing will help my chances of reconnecting with my ex? Or does all of this come across as desperate?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqsiv,Dad 'marrying' within a year after my mother's death,"My mother died suddenly and unexpectedly 10 months ago. It hit my father very hard, and he had a very hard time living alone after having been married to her most of his life. He went on a dating websites for widowers/widows (I previously didn't know this was a thing) and started a relationship with a widow about his age within a few months. Although I know my mother would have been fine with him starting a new relationship after her death (they mentioned this a few times when she was alive) it felt really quick to me. More importantly, my grandfather (my mother's father) is having a very hard time still with her death, and my father moving on so quickly is hard for him. To make matters worse, his new girlfriend has the same first name as my mother did, which means we must add 'new' or 'old' to disambiguate sometimes, which is obviously very uncomfortable.

While they cannot officially cohabitate or marry (both would lose their survivor's benefits, a surprisingly substantial amount of money), they announced they are planning an unofficial wedding ceremony. I'm not quite sure I want to attend. First of all, although love him and I'm happy for him having found new love, I don't feel this is reason to celebrate nor the time to do so withint a year of my mother's death, and even less so while my grandfather is still alive and grieving. Moreover, I feel it is very rushed. If it were for real, who would marry a person they first met less than a year ago? It makes me feel like it's really his grief driving him, with his new girlfriend filling the void left by my mother, and this is not a good basis for marriage (even if unofficial).

I'm not sure what to do, I don't really want to go but I don't want to let my father down either. Moreover, I don't like my father's actions being (unintentionally) painful to my grandfather, yet I don't really want to criticize him for his legitimate needs either.",relationship_advice

t3_dlqnkh,i don't want the sad to ruin my relationship,"(tw: mentions of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, suicide)

hey, this is my first time posting on reddit.

I was diagnosed with depression at age 18 (though I'm sure I had it since middle school) and have been getting on-and-off treatment since then. I'm 2o years old now. Earlier this year in February, I went to therapy again and started taking Prozac and started getting better. Much better. In those few months I felt that I was the happiest I had ever been. And I had very minimal suicidal thoughts which was great. I quit therapy sometime in August because we didn't have much to talk about during sessions which made me feel I was wasting my therapist's time. Fast forward to now, I didn't have transportation or money to pick up my prescription from the pharmacy at the beginning of September, so I stopped taking it.

I've gotten bad. really bad. started self harming again, feeling irritated, angry, at times numb. I'm sleeping a lot, etc.I start to isolate myself at times but I try to make myself go out (if I can) but anyway, overall, depression symptoms are back and I'm honestly expecting an episode soon. My problem is that I'm worried the symptoms will start affecting my relationship badly.

I (F, 20) started seeing this really sweet guy (M, 21) in August. It's been \~2 months but we're serious about each other. I think he's more serious about the relationship than I am (I'm more hesitant than him because of my living situation). The thing is, we started talking when I was doing well. But now I'm not, and I think he's noticed. I feel that I don't text him like I used it. I rarely check my phone through out the day and constantly telling him ""sorry, was asleep."" ""sorry,, wasn;t feeling well"" etc. Sometimes we're making out and in my head I'm thinking about the future worrying if I'm doing something wrong and thinking of past traumatic experiences then I get upset I ask him to stop kissing me then I just??? go quiet?? and sometimes I cry sometimes we cuddle but like I feel that it ruins whatever good thing was happening before.

One thing I mention to my therapists often is that I think I will eventually die by suicide??? My thing is, 11% of people suffering from depression eventually die by suicide. And it's been so hard and every time I get into a depressive episode, I think I will never get out of it. Like, studies show that the more depressive episodes you go through the worse it is in the next episode. I've attempted suicide three times already. I know things will get harder in the future, but I don't know if I will be strong enough to pull myself out of it again. It just, really sucks. I thought about going to therapy again, but it feels like it's no use. I already know what my therapist is going to say. Continue taking my meds and calling up some friends to hang. Those things aren't possible for me right now and she won't understand that. I know going to therapy will make me feel guilty and awful. I hate feeling bad for myself I feel so gross and pathetic and I feel awful about it.

I'm unable to be with this guy atm because I live with my parents and it's a toxic environment and things are complicated. I must conceal my relationship from them because I shouldn't be dating. I'm worried about them finding out about him and making things worse. so in my head 247 thinking of a million scenarios where things go wrong and my parents act violently towards me, i become homeless, I am forced into an arranged marriage, etc. And in my head, I'm already going through enough so any of these events could lead to my breaking point. I wouldn't be surprised if I were to die by suicide them. I mean, nothing is guaranteed. I don't know what the future looks like for me.

I know that we're serious about each other, and have similar intentions of a long term relationship and potentially a LDR (he's okay with it and he is aware of my situation), but anything could go wrong and I don't want to break his heart. ):

It's just, I'm in a lot of pain. He's been very supportive and he asks how I am and offers support and holds me when I cry and all the good things. Once he got me fishnets and it was my first time trying them on so I sent him pictures of them. Some of my cutting scars were visible if you were to zoom into the photo but I didn't think much of it and honestly felt that I looked hot at the time. He complimented me and about 30mins later sent a (not) random text saying ""we talk about a lot of random things, if you ever wanna talk about mental health thing, im here"" which tells me he saw. I'm honestly so conscious about it and I feel that whenever things start getting more physical and intimate between us I won't want him to see my legs but Idek what I would say to him): He knows I self harm because it came up in a conversation about how people start using substances or start using unhealthy coping mechanism. I feel that if I were to say something ""I don't want you to pay attention to the scars on my thighs"" then I want attention (that would b the 3rd time i bring it up)

Overall he's been so kind and understanding and I'm afraid of crossing a line or for this relationship to be toxic to him???? I've dated someone before (when I was doing good) and they weren't getting treated for depression and they didn't communicate with me what was going on and lacked empathy and were so rude and unkind to me and I would hate to be the same to him. I know I'm not right now but also I don't want for this to get worse and for me to be hurting him without knowing does that make sense. ?

Any advice on what to do?? If I were to talk to him about it what should I say??

TL;DR: I'm struggling with depression and I don't want it to ruin a healthy relationship.

t3_dlqnhk,Boyfriend (21 M) always changes views on the world,"Hi guys! I haven‚Äôt been able to find any posts about this so I thought I‚Äôd make my own. My boyfriend is so inconsistent in his views and perspective of the world. One week he believes in nihilism and the next he is on a Buddhist kick. I understand opening your mind to new perspectives, but his whole demeanor will change when he makes a shift in his views. Not only that, but he goes through an endless cycle of making drastic changes in his routine and then getting upset when he fails at them. As a result, he will be cold to me because he is frustrated at his own failures. I can‚Äôt keep up with this and I try to talk to him and he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal, humans just change‚Äù.

t3_dln9ho,Girlfriend of almost 3 years suddenly seems distant,"My girlfriend (F mid-20's) and I (M late 20's) have been together for almost 3 years now. It started out as a long distance relationship (a couple hours away) then she decided to move a bit closer to me. (To be clear she didn't move to be closer to me, but she says it did play a factor when looking for a new job. Her field of work allows her to work just about anywhere; my field of work not so much). A few months after she moved she was extremely unhappy with the place she was working at and told me she wanted to look for another job out state (a few hours away). Employment restrictions prevented her from simply moving to a different city within the same state. We sat down and had a discussion about it and talked about what we did and didn't like, weighed pros and cons, and I ended up telling her I'd support her decision in moving away and we'd do our best to make things work.

So a couple of months ago she made her move. I've been traveling when I'm able for a few days while she's off work to go and spend time with her, then drive back to give her space while she works. And this is where things began to feel off.

For the longest time, especially since she moved closer to me she made little effort to come and see me. I'd always be the one going to her. Also since she's moved further away again she's made no attempt to come visit me. And it's just seemed so one-sided. When we're together it's great. We get along well and always have lots of fun. 

The difficulty has always been making plans to get together and I don't mean logistically. She would rarely, if ever, ask me to come down to see her or offer to come up and see me. I'd always have to be the one to ask. ""When are you off work next? Did you want me to come down and see you on your days off?"" And her response would always be something vague and transparent. Usually it's something like ""Up to you."" I'd tell her that doesn't answer my question and she just repeats herself. Then I'd ask if she would rather have a few days off to herself to relax instead, and she just refuses to change her response. Let me reiterate that we always seem to have a great time being around each other whether we go out and do something and just sit around and do nothing. We definitely seem to enjoy each other's company.

So fast forward to a just over a week ago. I come back from having seen her for a few days and everything seemed good. Then a couple of days after she got suddenly distant. Like minimal responses to my texts and messages. One word replies. Never initiating any conversation whatsoever. I asked her is something was wrong because it seemed out of character of her. She assured me she was fine and left it at that. It's been almost 2 weeks and no improvement. I've asked her when she was off next to see if I could come see her and all she told me was she hasn't decided what she was going to be doing and left it at that.

I'm nearing my wits end here because obviously something is up but I don't know if it's something with her, something with me, or something between us. I'm waiting for the next time I see her to bring it up in person since she just shuts down any conversation I try to initiate through text. This didn't start until a couple days after I had seen her last and there's nothing that I believe I said or did to cause this, and going through my text logs, there's nothing I seem to have said in those couple of days that would cause her to be upset with me?

So I've just been giving her space because being too clingy certainly won't help things, but at the same time she makes it difficult/impossible to have any meaningful conversation with her. I don't believe she's seeing someone else because shes the type of person who would break things off before pursuing another person.

t3_dlqjrz,Haunting past relived in dream,"So let‚Äôs start off with...when I was 13 I was raped/molested several of times. I‚Äôve grown from then and tried to move past it. Currently my fianc√© (34M) and  I (30F) have been together for almost 11 years, full commitment and he does know of this past. 
So with all that, last night I had a dream that I walked into this weird Japan room- very big, mattress on the floor with lots of pillows and mood setting lights. Then I see my fianc√©e laying there and next to him is this tiny girl. Laying stiff but alive next to him; she had some kind of wrap around her eyes. There‚Äôs a voice from the room that‚Äôs her voice saying she‚Äôs ready to die. I‚Äôm not really sure that in my dream I know how there are certain rules. So when I hear her voice again that‚Äôs when the play starts. He tells me to just go. So I back out of the room and I start to hear her voice- his body moves towards her almost like he has no control over it. The door shut in front of me and at this point I know what‚Äôs about to happen... I run far away down the hallway but I hear him start to rape her.....I hear the most heart wrenching calls for help and screams from her..and then choke her to death and silence.I end up waiting in our car on the side of a busy road in the town. When I left him it was night, the next time- when I‚Äôm sitting, it‚Äôs late morning. I see him with a nice coat casually walking towards the car and gets in. Proceeds to drive us both home- not saying anything and acting like nothing happened. Then I woke up in deep sweat. I tried to go back to sleep but honestly all I could hear were her screams echoing down the hallways. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt even look at him when I woke up. I broke down in tears in bed. After an hour I just got dressed and left to the store to get some air and some me time. He texted me asking if everything was ok cuz I never just leave without saying bye. I get back home and just tell him that I had a bad dream but no details- as he comforts me, I feel disconnected from him and just cry. I don‚Äôt know how I can convince myself it was just a dream. I don‚Äôt even want to be around him at all. Any advice?",relationship_advice

t3_dlqilz,My bf (26) is immature and a man-child,"I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years, he is the kindest and truly cares about me. We are best friends and tell each other everything. To be fair, he has always had this ""immature"" side to him but I always thought it was something he would grow out of. However, he has not made any improvements throughout the years, if anything he became even more immature. His mother has always made his choices even regarding which program and classes he should take in school and he never put himself out there on his own. He always needs a push from someone. I tried to tell him that we need to take things more seriously especially if we are thinking of having a family. He is often afraid of failure or even accepting job offers that would make him a more rounded person. He is comfortable with just using his mother's money and he tells me that he will just continue the family business. He does not have anything on his CV because he never had a job. I think that he needs to step out of his comfort zone and learn some things the hard way in order to mature. I suggested that he stops using his family's money and that he should finish his university degree (he has been dropping classes on and off and his overall grades are very low) , find a job and that we should start paying by ourselves. But I don't see him making any steps towards that. He does not have any achievements and therefore has very low-self esteem to the point that he doesn't want to hang out with people which he thinks are ""smarter than him"". As soon as he is faced with a brick wall he is not willing to break it. He prefers just being comfortable and playing video games and watching movies all day long. He is very un-motivated and immature about life in general. I love him very much and I want to help him without nagging and playing the role of his mother. Any suggestions?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqhdi,I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to feel about relationship,"Okay brief history but I met this girl about 7 weeks ago online and have been talking to her since then. We met during our second week of talking and I felt like we clicked and enjoyed spending time together and began to meet every other weekend. The third time we met I asked her in a subtle way if she had feelings for me like I did for her and she said yes and I asked if she was okay with making it official to date/call her my girlfriend.

Fast forward we began to be intimate with each other whenever she came over.  However, over this past weekend, when she came over I noticed that she acted less friendly and she would turn her phone on airplane mode and when I was curious about it she said she told her friends that she was with family and didn‚Äôt want them to know where she was but I just brushed it off. 

I feel like she‚Äôs trying to keep me a secret as she refers to me as a friend to her friends and feel like she doesn‚Äôt really like me or want to be dating even though she shows physical emotion when we are together. 

I also found out that she still uses tinder and this has me worried that she is seeing other people because

t3_dlqf17,My (23M) girlfriends (21F) Father(48) is destroying her.,"Sorry if that title is a little misleading but I do really need as many advices as I can get!

I‚Äôm very concerned about my GF. She‚Äôs a really loving and caring person. Plus she‚Äôs the most selfless person I have ever met. But that‚Äôs also the problem.

She never cares for herself. She‚Äôs the type of the person that would take all the pain from a person and suffer in order to make the other person happy. 

And that exactly is happening between her and her dad. They don‚Äôt have a healthy relationship. Her dad is a very busy businessman and became unfortunately (because of all the stress of his company) addicted to alcohol and gambling. 

Hes stuck in a vicious cycle in where he increases his stress by constantly drinking and gambling everyday which is only making him more problems everyday. 

That‚Äôs whats making my GF depressed. She cares a lot for him and seeing him in so much stress just frustrates and depresses her more and more. 

Now she really tried everything to help him get out of there. But her dad is the type of the person who is not letting anyone help him.

My GF is now also stuck in a vicious cycle where she tries everyday to help him. But in the end she just get rejected again. This hurts her a lot and she can‚Äôt cope with this. 

Unfortunately she isn‚Äôt able to help him and she doesn‚Äôt want to understand that. 

I‚Äôm very concerned for her as I see her everyday getting frustrated again and it‚Äôs not headed in a good direction.

I don‚Äôt know how to help her or even her dad. I don‚Äôt know how to teach her that it‚Äôs not possible to help him. He is really important to her and that‚Äôs why she do not want to understand that she can‚Äôt help him or to move on.

What should I do? I‚Äôm really confused.

When I first met my GF, she was the most independent girl I‚Äôve ever seen, which is one of the reasons I fell for her. She was strong, funny, caring, not to mention fucking gods most perfect creation, but... heres the catch. She was against any and all ‚Äùcouples‚Äù things. Like kissing in public, just a quick goodbye kiss, letting other people know we were together, tagging eachother in social medias, all ‚Äùcutesy‚Äù things. I adapted to this, albeit extremely hard to do because Im generally kinda ‚Äùlovey-dovey‚Äù sometimes.

So after 8 months together. This has all flipped upside down. We were on vacation and she got really upset that I had stopped asking her if she slept well or sending ‚Äùgoodmorning texts‚Äù. Like we couldn‚Äôt even go to the beach because she wasn‚Äôt talking to me. She got upset because I dont show her as much affection anymore. I do though, I bought her flowers and stuff. I‚Äôve like toned it down by 30%, even that was too much before. Seeing her get sad and upset honestly broke my heart because I asked her once if she believed me when I told her that I loved her and she said ‚ÄùI want to‚Äù.

t3_dli921,He's Religious. I'm Not. How Do We meet In The Middle?,"Before getting into a relationship, we talked about religion. I was worried that I would be in the way of his relationship with God and that I didn't want to interfere. He reassured me and told me that as long as we respect each other's views that we would be fine. This was two months ago.

Then last night he called me and told me that he feels like ""our relationship is hindering him and his religion,"" and it hurt so much. He said how it's hard to express himself in that way and that he wants to be able to, but that it's hard because I can't ever relate to him. I asked him how can I help and what can I do to be a better and supportive girlfriend, but he says that I have been really respectful of him and his religion, allowing him to sing songs to me, allowing him to pray, and being open to talking about religion, and says that he's really thankful that I have been nothing but supportive and open. He says that he really wants to be with me and that we wants to give this a chance, and I do too. He says that if he didn't think we could work it out that he wouldn't even bother bringing this up and instead just leave me. And as of now, I should just continue to be myself and not change for him. 

The thing that sucks about all this is that I can't change and he can't change and that we have to accept each other. I know we'll get to that place of accepting each other, but even then I still feel like he would be better off with someone else who IS religious and someone he can share that with. And I feel like we're so young (me being F19 and him being M20) that I don't know if it would be realistic to put all of my hope into thinking that we could actually last for a long time and  through this because again it's out of my control. I feel like I either have two choices:

1. Leave because we deserve better people + we're young + it's early in our relationship so cutting it off now would be best,

or 2. Give it a chance and try my best to make this work while keeping in mind that even if it doesn't work that it's not my fault (unless otherwise) and that it just means that I need to find myself someone who is better fit for me and same goes for him

I like this guy a lot and am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any advice?

UPDATE: I have made my choice. Although at first I was very conflicted on what I want, I know that I like him a lot and that if I truly loved him that I would see him for the person he is and not his religion. I want to clarify that I am deeply respectful of his religion and his decisions as both an individual and a person of God. I was mentioning how I was scared of getting hurt and the possibility of our relationship ending because of religion, but not anymore. Why? What changed? I talked to someone who was in a position where she was solely religious and has come out from that. She told me how it takes time for someone who is religious to adjust themselves for others and it's not easy. I can see where she is coming from along with my boyfriend and it's fair. She said even after going through a few break ups with her current boyfriend that it was hard for the both of them, but she learned that she needed to look at the relationship as a relationship with two people who are great listeners or genuinely kind hearted individuals, and not two people who hold different spiritual or religious point of views. That's why I am not scared, because I know that even if things don't work out that it has nothing to do with me (that is, if I truly accept and stop mopping about this one little difference), and that if he leaves me that I should be happy for him. And I will be happy for him for it will provide me with a sense of reassurance and closure. I can't ever tell the future nor can I tell how he will feel about me years, months, or days from now, but I know that for one thing I really want to be with him and there's nothing else I want. I wanna be there for him when he's low, when he's happy, and when he's in a mood to express his love for God. I want to be a part of that journey. I can't ever know how he feels about me, but knowing that I can make peace with this, try my best, and be content with the outcomes is what I truly believe is enough. If you are reading this and going through a tough time, know that it will be hard, it will hurt, but we have to put aside our needs and desires for something true. For instance, I was selfish and scared to get hurt with the possibility that he may leave me, but damn how worse would it be looking back and remembering that I broke up with him without giving it a chance? I do feel that religion, yes, is a touchy subject and can be really difficult to adjust to, but with the right people, right mindsets, and clear boundaries will there come brighter days. I have faith in him and I hope he has that with me.",relationship_advice

I don't feel comfortable with her in public because of the thought of not having one of the best looking girls

The only time I feel 100% comfortable with her is when we are alone or I am a bit buzzed

I am being told by my parents that I am MUCH better looking than she is

I know I am much better looking because I know other more attractive ladies that are into me

I enjoy to workout, she doesn't

She doesn't try to make good relationships with her teammates, I do with mine (we are both wrestlers at this college)

She is not very popular with her team. Popular as in her teammates wanting to actually hangout with her during free time

Other girls dislike her just because I am with her (jealous? idk)

I want to thrive to become better everyday and want better things, she just wants to go with the flow.

The only thing we really have in common is being able to joke around and get along very  well

We got together really fast and it just feels like I'm settling because I found someone to like me a whole lot and can have intense sex with.

I don't think I want to be in a relationship anymore/ I want to chase after other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might think that it is kind of fucked up that I judge a girl by her looks, which is partially true. But the thing is, I want the best. I want to be the best at what I do and I want to be with the best lady I can be with. Personality wise she is a cool person. But that is all. She has not done anything to screw me over or for me to be mad at. She has been nothing but good to me, which makes me real unsure about how and when I would break up with her. I have been texting her less and seeing her less, and it has been really easy for me to do so. The lovey dovey stage is over for me and now I feel over it. All of her friends are my friends and all of my friends are her friends. Not to sound arrogant, but we have been known as the ""ideal couple"" around our different groups of friends. This is mostly because that we never argue or have problems. Her friends talk so highly of me too because I always make sure to treat her like a lady and address any concerns she may have.

I don't know how to break it off with her. I am sure not going to say some shit like ""im out of your league"", but I do not know what else to say. I do not want this to be a bad breakup where a whole group of her friends are going to hate me or treat me different (we go to a small school so everyone knows everyone).

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions, thoughts, or ideas about my situation? If any of yall have questions, I will answer them. Pick my brain and help me find a way to break it off.

t3_dlq8al,Conflicted about how I feel about my friends,"I‚Äôve known my two friends for well over a year now, long distance (I‚Äôll call them T and D)

They‚Äôre the most special people in my life, only thing is that I‚Äôm not so special to them 

I know I can‚Äôt change how much others care about me, should I keep trying to learn to accept that?

They‚Äôre practically dating which is totally chill, and they‚Äôve both got a group of friends

T is a more emotional person while D is a more privately emotional person, she keeps to herself a lot 

I‚Äôve always seeked D‚Äôs validation, I‚Äôve spent 8 hours making crafts for her (we are arty people) and I‚Äôve made multiple of them, and when a special event comes around (her birthday or Christmas) I spend two weeks making her a gift, I‚Äôve even sent her a package before, which she‚Äôs appreciated 

Only thing is, even after all that T asked her if she cared about me and she said ‚Äúeh‚Äù

It‚Äôs been months and the answer has turned into a yes, but she said she doesn‚Äôt love me, she only loves T

I understand this, I just don‚Äôt know how to feel

D has suddenly lost a bunch of energy and doesn‚Äôt talk to me as much, maybe three or less messages a day, and she‚Äôll often be active but not respond to me at all

If I stop responding however she will get worried if she did something 

T and D make everything about one another, and I happen to witness a lot of it which makes me feel hurt when I‚Äôm being ignored by D and T tells me how lovey she‚Äôs being 

T and D constantly make gifts for one another and T used to show me all of it, however I never receive any gifts from them, despite me always giving them gifts 

Is it selfish of me to want something in return sometimes?

On T and I‚Äôs friend anniversary I made her a gift !! But she didn‚Äôt make me one, which is fine she often doesn‚Äôt have time to

However later that day she made D not one, by two gifts and showed them to me

And she later left me alone to go on a call with D, it felt like she made our day about her and D. She apologized for this saying she wasn‚Äôt thinking, but it still hurt 

I tried talking to them about how I feel but things haven‚Äôt really changed 

I always wanted T D and I to be a trio, but D expressed to T that she doesn‚Äôt want to be part of it, admitting she felt mean saying that

I don‚Äôt know how to feel, I want to be special to them like they are to me, I don‚Äôt want to leave them and I‚Äôve had a really hard time making new friends after meeting them, mostly because I don‚Äôt want their attention as much as I want my friends‚Äô

I‚Äôve been trying to learn to accept just being part of their crowd, but it‚Äôs hard and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore

I feel like I‚Äôm starting to give up, they care but why can‚Äôt I feel it? Have I given too much? Am I too much? Am I an asshole for wanting so much of their attention? 

TL;DR - doing everything I can for my friends but I‚Äôm still not anyone special to them, what do I do?",relationship_advice

t3_dlq50p,My boyfriend's [26M] attitude towards me changes whenever I [24F] say I'm on my period,"When I tell him I'm on my period, suddenly everything I say after that, he'll take it in a negative way even though I'm just saying it like I usually would.

We're talking on the phone and if he's in a bad mood, he'll suddenly hang up on me because I'm trying to ""start a fight"", which I'm not? He won't talk to me much because he ""doesn't want to deal with a crazy psycho"". I do admit there are times I've gotten really angry, it's usually because he finds it hilarious to get me mad ""for fun"". This happens despite being on period or not but it seems like only remembers me getting mad and forgets the reason why.

We hardly get to see each other, once every 1-2 months maybe. I have Sat/Sunday off, he has random days of the week off. 2 weeks ago, when our weekends aligned, I was ready to do the 6 hour drive. The night before, I mentioned I was just finishing my period and suddenly he tells me not to come anymore because he doesn't have the energy to deal with me going crazy? I was really hurt and upset

I didn't bother telling him about my period last week, and when he asked, I said I already finished. I brought up (again) how nothing about me is different, but when I do tell him I'm on my period, his whole attitude towards me changes. He brushes me off like he usually does and told me to stop being childish (because I keep bringing this up) and that I ""must have tried really hard to not go crazy"". Um okay?

t3_dlt12z,My [25m] girlfriend [22f] says I make her feel like shit just by existing,"Together for 1.5 years and slightly exaggerated title (she did not say that exact sentence) but that's sure what it feels like. I'm so frustrated but not sure how to respond here since I feel bad for her/want to help.

My gf is very insecure. Always has been insecure but especially right now because she has had some bad luck lately and is going through a hard time. She got in a car wreck and lost her job, and she has also gained some weight due to stress eating. She's noticeably heavier and cant fit into old clothes so she feels terrible. 

I try to help by reassuring her that she is always beautiful to me (she is), being affectionate with her, offering help and support, being there for her, encouraging texts. 

But she has started directing her feelings at me. Generally being rude/hateful and honestly a total bitch sometimes just because I have good things going on. 

She hates on me because I have a good paying job working for my dad's business and her only options rn are retail, so she says I'm just spoiled/entitled and don't realize how lucky I am. That I only got the job because of ""neopotism"" and I got lucky, meanwhile she's suffering because she gets no ""free handouts.""

Hates on me because I drive a nice car (that I worked hard to buy) that will last me a long time and she wrecked her nice car, so now she drives an old beat up corolla and says that I ""think I'm better than her"" because I drive a nice car. I dont think I'm better than her!! I have not said one word about anything! I never brag. 

Hates on me because I am naturally very skinny and dont gain weight easily. This is actually something I am insecure about, as I'd like to gain more weight (muscle) but she compares her body to mine. Said that I think I'm better than her because she is fat (she is not) and sometimes even just yells at me not to look at her. I remind her that she isn't fat, and that I'm a lot taller than her and also a dude so it's not a good idea to compare, and that shes beautiful anyways.

 I try to suggest we go on walks/jogs together if it will make her feel better, she turns me down so I let it go.

There are other things, but you get the picture. How tf do you deal with your partner being ""jealous"" of you? I don't brag about anything ever and it would be stupid if I did. It's like she hates anything ""good"" that I have and makes it about her and why she is a victim. 

Is there any way I can help her feel better or should I somehow put my foot down? What to say? Am tired of the rudeness.",relationship_advice

t3_dlt0yb,Am I [22M] in the wrong with my gf [21F] by trying to be very egalitarian with finances,"Hello r/relationship_advice,

Some backstory: 
My girlfriend of 8 months and I have been having alot of arguments recently due to the fact I try to keep our contributions to the relationship pretty close to 50-50. We're both in college and both don't have alot extra to be spending. Since the start of the relationship I've been a very equal guy, as in if she takes me out then I'll take her out, and if she buys me food then I'll buy her food and vice versa. Its also important to note we take each other out on a surprise date every month and so we do still go on dates semi frequently. We also both have jobs although mine pays slightly more she gets a bunch of scholarship money, but I have student loans and she doesn't.

So recently as of last month we've been having repeated arguments because it's her stance that since she is the girl she deserves to be taken out more and for me to get her gifts/spoil her. My position is that since we're both poor college students 50/50 is fine at least for now. Am I being unreasonable or unrealistic wanting the relationship to be 50/50 or no?",relationship_advice

t3_dlszqb,"I suspect my SO doesn‚Äôt trust me, and I‚Äôm terrified of losing him","My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years. I love him more than anything else in the world, he means everything to me. But lately I‚Äôve noticed that if I go a certain amount of time without responding to a text, or go somewhere without telling him, he‚Äôll make suspicious comments about it. 

For example, just now him and I were texting somewhat consistently, and after he sent one message I didn‚Äôt notice my phone go off. I was pretty into a movie I was watching, so I didn‚Äôt really think to check my phone. An hour later, I check and see he texted, so I responded along the lines of ‚Äúoh shit my bad I didn‚Äôt notice that text, what‚Äôs up‚Äù. And his response, as usual now, is along the lines of ‚Äúsuuuuuure..‚Äù or ‚Äúok.‚Äù Or ‚Äúinteresting.‚Äù He recently made an analogy after a similar situation saying one should not leave food in the oven too long, it‚Äôll burn. ?????

It really throws me off because I feel like he suspects I‚Äôm cheating on him. I haven‚Äôt, and would never fucking think about it ever. I live with my parents, and besides being at home or at work, I spend my spare time with him. I love him so much, but these comments really fucking throw me off. I‚Äôm heartbroken to ever think he‚Äôd even suspect me of something like hiding something or lying to him. I‚Äôm scared to sit down and talk to him about it, what if he accuses me of something I didn‚Äôt do? How would I even prove I‚Äôm innocent if he simply just doesn‚Äôt believe me?

t3_dlq28c,"Am I thinking too much, is it me? Or is he at wrong?","I've been dating¬†my boyfriend¬†for a year now and I have run into a few frustrating experiences and I'm just wondering if it's me or them. In part I do feel like I am very attached and needy, so in stating everything that follows I want to be fair enough to provide that preface while proceeding to detail everything. Right now I am just very frustrated and I think it is mostly to do with me, however I know that this person is still at wrong in certain instances. I think I tend to draw things out of proportion, over analyze and overthink on things. I also do not know how to address the wrong, I tend to get frustrated and accuse my significant other when I suspect them of something. A lot of the problems I have with him is trust, communication, quality time, and his friendships with other female friends.One reoccurring issue I am having right now is the fact that he sleep talks sometimes. In the past I have heard him state all of the following while sleep talking  
¬†""One girl likes this {sexual excerpt/position} and the other girl likes this{sexual excerpt/position} done to her""He has on occasion¬†been sleep talking¬†to someone in Spanish (I don't speak Spanish), while sexual fondling me""I consider myself sexually social""""This girl had big tit¬† and she liked it {more sexual¬†excerpt}'  
He will again sexually fondle me¬†while¬†talking to someone else, whilst dreaming. I have addressed these all with him and he states that this is not a natural representation of who he is. The sexually social one was most recent, it angered me the most. He stated this the night before he left on a business trip. The morning of said ""sexually social"" dream, as he was getting ready to go on said trip. On the morning he was leaving to this trip he made sure to shave, did not wear his glasses as he usually does 89% of time, instead he wore contacts. On top of this he fixed his hair and instead of wearing a normal work shirt then left with a dress collared shirt instead of a t-shirt which is what he normally wears, as he is not required to dress up for this job.¬† I then addressed the dream thing with him which he¬†pushed off as just a dream and told me not¬†to worry,¬†he then took his bags and is to be gone for three days. He has been taking work trips more frequently and another issue I am having is communication. In the end I want a relationship with someone who¬†values me and wants to talk to me.¬†He recently took another work trip for a week and I averaged an hour of talk time for that week.¬† He would often call me for a few minutes and state that he had to go because he was at dinner, out, etc. He is on a trip with good people, all have girlfriends as well. In the end I trust him although his behaviors are innocent, I still have doubts and concerns that run into my mind. I talked to him later in the evening after work for his business trip and he stated to me that he was going to meet up with some mutual friends of one of his work friends. I contemplated if his whole change in his physical appearance was attributed to the fact that he is in a different town, or more so that he was meeting these ""friends"" as he might know who all might be there.There are times when we are hanging out and instead of us enjoying our time, he makes it a point to invite someone else.I don't understand why we can't enjoy our time together alone. This is on a constant basis that he is inviting someone or someone is casually entering in our time together.Another annoying and sometimes hurtful habit he will have is social media. There are times where I'll notice he is active posting on instagram and will not make the imitative to communicate with me. Sometimes he will be completely engulfed into instagram, while we are trying to spend time together. He also has two female friends which I do not enjoy hanging around. One of the friends I have made countless attempts to get along with and am not able to. She seems to treat me right only when we are together as a group. However when I try to get along with her on my own we do not get along. I will try to talk to her and she will often cut me short or make very derogatory comments. another female friend of his is someone who tends¬†to flirt with him¬†while I'm around them both, he will¬†sometimes feed into it and I dislike it.¬†  
I understand he has to have his life and he is not perfect but I feel like I am internally at a constant struggle to reason through everything. Is he wrong for the things I mentioned(maybe for not even most of them?) or is it just me?",relationship_advice

t3_dlswri,How do I [27f] maintain a mutually beneficial friendship with someone [27f] that refuses to help herself?,"My best friend is an INFP and I am an INTP. We frequently have communication issues and fights where she feels I am not being sensitive enough, while I think she is projecting her insecurities onto me. I'm exhausted. I love her and care about her and want to maintain a friendship, but it is tiring being around someone who would rather complain about the same problems every day instead of trying to fix them.

For example, one night we both talked about how we needed to put more effort in at our respective jobs, despite not being excited about the work. Something that would require self-discipline. The next day at work, she sent me messages talking about how bored she was. I suggested just 10 minutes on a project would count as progress and help her actualize the goals she stated yesterday. She told me that she didn't want to be lectured and couldn't do it because she didn't want to.

I brought her to a spin class hoping she would appreciate the external motivation. She hopped off her bike early, refused to stretch with the rest of the class, and said (within earshot of the instructor) that she ""was never coming back"". I didn't bring it up because I know she didn't mean to be rude and she was just feeling insecure about not being able to keep up and simply didn't enjoy the activity. I made sure to champion her for trying it and learning something new about her preferences, but she had a bad mood for hours afterward.

She constantly talks about how ugly, fat, and worthless she is, yet gets offended if I try to provide resources on insecurity and emotional regulation. She does see a therapist. We had previously tried a mutually-agreed upon ""no negativity"" rule, but she gave up quickly and called me controlling when I tried to hold us both accountable.

I'm at my wit's end trying to be supportive without being enabling. She takes issue with me trying to solve her issues instead of commiserating, but it goes against my problem-solving nature to validate the actions of someone who is hurting themselves.

Help please. I'm afraid of her being hurt if she sees this, but I'm more afraid of losing a good friend to her own harmful thoughts.",relationship_advice

‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt find him physically/sexually attractive at all. (Like he‚Äôs cute and all but I think it‚Äôs disgusting when I kiss him and hugging is okay)
‚Ä¢I have big insecurities but he does flirt with a lot of girls. He‚Äôs obviously crushing hard on my cousin - that‚Äôs been for at least a year now. 
‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt think I can trust him but because of the person he is at heart, he probably wouldn‚Äôt. 
‚Ä¢I have never cheated but I badly want to see what it‚Äôs like with another guy. I want to flirt and see what it‚Äôs like to be single again. 
‚Ä¢I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll make a mistake later on and realize I should‚Äôve just dealt with it. 
‚Ä¢I miss him when I‚Äôm like not with him but not when I‚Äôm with him. (duh he‚Äôs there)
‚Ä¢We act more like best friends and joke with each other a lot more than couples (Which I enjoy more than being all cute) - i know this is fine for some people in relationships but I crave a relationship where I actually want to hug and kiss and cuddle a lot but I don‚Äôt want to do that with him.
‚Ä¢ ^^^Thats actually really weird bc i get mega jealous when he does all this flirting or talking to girls?? Like I‚Äôm emotionally in love with him but physically not?

More just ‚Äú I like you like this, Trynna find out if it‚Äôs reciprocated‚Äù

She was surprised at first and asked if I was fucking with her

She said sorta does but hasn‚Äôt said anything because she feels like she might switch up later on??

I can‚Äôt tell really what she meant and honestly I‚Äôm fine just being friends I just don‚Äôt want this to ruin anything",relationship_advice
t3_dlstn9,My Girlfriend,"My girlfriend(23f), who hides our relationship status on facebook, hides tags events in fear of coworkers sending me a message stating she's cheating.

t3_dlput7,My ex bf wants a second chance? Does he actually love me? Will this keep happening when he gets stressed?,"How would you guys react if this happened to you? Me(23F) and bf (23M)of 6 years broke up bc he needed time to grow and learn how to be happy on his own and he didn‚Äôt have the time or his heart in our relationship? He has a tough life taking care of his family by himself so I understood. He swore he wasn‚Äôt looking for anyone else bc he wanted to marry me. After we broke up he did some pretty shady things and then hooked up with 2 girls drunk (usually he‚Äôs not a drinker) one week apart twice each bc he was ‚Äúdepressed and missed me and his ego couldn‚Äôt tell me he made a mistake and it just happened he didn‚Äôt go out of his way to hook up with them.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt tell me at first he lied to my face for about a month I was about to take him back then he finally told me the truth because I caught him in a lie. To make things worse one of the girls he had sex with we‚Äôve talked about and he knows I‚Äôve never liked sooo it was basically a slap in the face after 5 years together. He‚Äôs always told white lies but when we broke up his lies got a lot bigger. If we would have broken up with me and told me we didn‚Äôt have a future I wouldn‚Äôt care who he hooked up with bc it‚Äôs not my business anymore. Now he‚Äôs trying to get back with me after reflecting and making changes 5 months later saying he‚Äôs sorry, he made a mistake, he‚Äôs done lying and would do anything for a second chance. We been broken up for about 6-7 months and he hooked up with these girls a month after.  

What would you do? I‚Äôm obviously extremely hurt and kind of grossed out he was capable of hurting me and not thinking about how this would affect us.",relationship_advice
t3_dlssbr,a question to those who have a partner with BPD getting treatment,"hello! im (25f) my girlfriend is (24f). she has bpd. we are currently in a LDR and we‚Äôve known each other for two years, been together for a year and a half. we met each other in person early september and im absolutely head over heels for her, she‚Äôs so smart, funny, thoughtful, attentive, affectionate, caring. wildly supportive of me on top of that.

we‚Äôve been working hard on our communication but sometimes we will have small disagreements that blow up into absurd fights. i have tried very hard to keep her bpd in mind when i navigate these fights, and im careful and respectful, but she doesn‚Äôt like when i voice my feelings or request an apology for something she has done wrong. occasionally manipulation tactics will be used, and then the silent treatment. she can avoid me for DAYS. it gets to the point where i feel like im on eggshells (and i hate having to say that). im in love with this girl. i want to spend my life with her. she has expressed wanting to spend hers with me, and wanting to get married and have children.

so here‚Äôs where my question comes in: my girlfriend will be getting treated for her bpd when we move in together. can anyone shed some light on whether they have been in my shoes, and whether their situation with a bpd partner improved after treatment?

t3_dlpugu,Feeling resentment towards close family and want to go NC. Am I doing the wrong thing?,"I (27F) grew up in an abusive household and didn‚Äôt have a close relationship with my parents and sister. My sister and I, for the last few years, have been trying to mend our relationship and although not close, we care for one another. I bonded and grew up with my cousin May(28F) who‚Äôs very close with our cousin Pete (26M). Although we grew up together, I was never as close to Pete as my sister and May were. 

A few years ago, I was sexually assaulted by Pete. I felt disgusted and shameful. I was afraid of telling my sister. I felt they were the only family I had, I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the ‚Äúcloseness‚Äù we had. Essentially I didn‚Äôt want to be alone and I was afraid of finding out that they‚Äôd maybe choose him over me. 

I ended up telling the one person I truly trusted, May. It was swept under the rug and long forgotten. It was like nothing happened. They still hang out and still talk. I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting out of telling her but I felt betrayed. I‚Äôd like to think that if it were her in my shoes, I‚Äôd at least be angry.. So now I‚Äôm feeling resentment towards both Pete and May. I can no longer trust either of them and I‚Äôm feeling as though the ‚Äúfamily bond‚Äù we had just never existed. He gets to be happy while I‚Äôm left here feeling dejected.

Am I wrong for expecting anything from her? Is it unfair for me to go NC when she technically did nothing wrong? 

I‚Äôm truly lost reddit. I don‚Äôt want to end my relationship with May but I just feel betrayed. I can‚Äôt keep hanging out with her knowing that she‚Äôs still in contact out with Pete. Once I cut off contact from both of them, then I‚Äôd truly be alone.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsrtx,My best friend won‚Äôt talk to me. Do i just forget about it forever or try and reach out one last time?,"So I (27 f) had a best friend (23 f). I love her to pieces even though she makes some really bad choices. We used to be inseparable and she was the one who I would always go to for support. We also worked together for a long while. 

Well, she got a new job so naturally I didn‚Äôt see her as much but we still texted all the time. Well that all changed seemingly out of the blue. I got really busy with finals and we didn‚Äôt talk for a bit. After my classes were over I texted her to see what was going on. She never texted me back. So i tried a Facebook message, nothing. Instagram, nothing. I sent one more text, still nothing. So I was a bit concerned/confused so I messaged the dude that she was seeing casually for a bit. We are all familiar with each other and i knew he would know since she liked him so much.

Turns out, she told him that I no longer care about her and that I‚Äôve alienated her. I honestly have no clue how she got that idea. Well she hasn‚Äôt deleted me off of anything, but my messages are ignored.

t3_dlsrr7,Coworker friend (28m) gets drunk &amp; confesses feelings for me (30F). Then doesn‚Äôt remember?!?,"Just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar and your take on it? 

Honestly at the time it happened we had both been drinking but always have deep talks about all kinds of things. It seemed a natural progression. I did not get the vibe he was at that point of drunkenness at all but we‚Äôve only hung out outside of work a few times and drank together even less.

I‚Äôm honestly wishing I could forget what he said because it was all things I felt too. I highly doubt he was lying because of how much it all resonated. And if he was just saying things to attempt to get laid could have easily gone home with me that night but he didn‚Äôt. 

I am older and have a position at our job that could deem our ‚Äúsituation‚Äù unprofessional if not handled correctly. It wouldn‚Äôt break any policies or anything but it would be a bit sticky to navigate.

Since that night I‚Äôve taken the high road. He knows he said some ‚Äúsweet‚Äù things but I figure if he truly can‚Äôt remember them or is denying them then they don‚Äôt matter anyway, right? The entire thing has definitely thrown me for a loop. 

We have an awesome connection/bond that even I don‚Äôt understand fully and it sucks to feel like I have to put up that wall now and can‚Äôt really trust him. We‚Äôve been very close friends for about 9 months now but had only recently begun hanging out together outside of work.

t3_dlsrcm,Should I (f 17) be worried that my sister (26) appears to treat her husband (30?) as an authority figure,"I‚Äôve been staying with my sister for a couple of weeks now and this is the most time I‚Äôve spent with her in a long time. The last time I saw her was 2015. I live in New York and she lives in Florida. We share a father and she was raised by him but I‚Äôve been raised by my mom. My mom and I don‚Äôt really get along anymore and her boyfriend treats me really badly so I asked my sister if I could live with her and she said yes. 

I‚Äôve just noticed the way my sister is with her husband and it just gives me a bad vibe. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overthinking though. But she really just worships the ground he walks on. She waits on him hand and foot. She looks at him with adoration but also just honestly seems fearful of him. Like she‚Äôs very meek around him and I‚Äôve noticed a few times her hands shake and her eyes water around him. It‚Äôs weird. She‚Äôs all ‚Äúyes baby‚Äù this and ‚Äúyes baby‚Äù that I haven‚Äôt heard her say no to him once. The best way to describe it is she treats him almost like really high authority, like a king or a god. 

He‚Äôs been nice to me and he is very charming but it‚Äôs also clear to me he has a very big ego.

And then the biggest thing is, a few nights ago I heard a sound that really sounded like he hit her but I can‚Äôt be sure and then I heard her crying in the bath a little after that. And then there were flowers on the table the next morning. 

I don‚Äôt know. My sister seems happy mostly, and all she really does is lay around and drink and go out she enjoys her life for all I have seen. Her husband also seems to buy her a lot of gifts, she has a lot of jewelry and other things from him. He bought her a really nice car on her birthday that was recent. But I don‚Äôt know she just also seems a little sad at the same time.

Should I be worried for her? Should I just wait and see if I notice anything more? And if I do? I‚Äôm kinda lost on what I should be doing. It gives me a really bad feeling that‚Äôs all, but maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking everything.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnvc3,"The last week has caused a major rift between me [19M] and my girlfriend [19F], and I don't know how to fix it","Last week, my girlfriend and I decided to get engaged, since we had been dating for about a year, planned on getting engaged sometime soon anyway, and it would benefit us as we could get cheaper married housing next year (I'm a sophomore and she's a freshman). It was more so her idea than mine to get married way earlier than I planned (I planned on proposing next semester), and I already made a huge decision of moving across the country with her to go to uni with her (I dropped quite a bit of social groups and such because of it, and have been relying on really her for friends).

Ever since things have been different between us. She suffers from mental illness, such as PTSD from childhood trauma and sexual assault, so her depression intensified since last week. I thought it was all the stress of the engagement. Eventually she starts wanting to do things she typically doesn't want to do like go to the club, do harder drugs like LSD, etc. She used to be a pretty reserved and quiet girl (she did a lot of weed and was pretty sexually active in the past, but when we first started dating she was getting well past that), but since starting college and her roommates being what I would call ""e girls"" she seems to be getting influenced from them a lot, especially since there's been points where she won't go a night high on something (usually weed). Different interests developing, that's fine and all.

We go to a gay club nearby our university, and we're both pretty intoxicated. I'm on a combination of nicotine, weed, and a little bit of alcohol while she is **really** high on weed. She's grinding on me, making out, etc. all that stuff talking about how she wants to have sex with me when we go back to the room (which she shares).

We go back to the room and then the lights are turned off. She takes her breasts out and starts pushing them in my face, pushing my head on them etc. etc. all while doing graphic things to my crotch. I ask a few times if we can go further, she says no, but we keep on doing intense foreplay. Eventually I ask her to flip over after this and she sticks my (blank) in her (blank) and we go at it for a while, before she suddenly tells me to stop. The next morning she asks me to leave and tells me she does not want me around her while her and her friends do LSD, because I sexually assaulted her when she thought I was going to hug her.

I will say that's pretty scummy of me to do. After she told me that I kinda avoided her. We share a car, and initially after that incident she let me take it back to my place, then she asks for it. I was pretty certain we were on the verge of breaking up, so in the process, I took my Xbox and clothes from her room because I wasn't sure this was gonna end well. She was pissed from this from what I later learned because she thought I was being selfish, though her roommates helped me grab my shit and go. Later in the day they're on LSD, and she has a bad trip; she is crying and asks me over so I come; she tells me I better leave once she's sober because sober her sober self is mad at me, so I keep my distance from her. Again, she said later that she me to hug her at this point, but I was afraid she would get upset if I touched her due to the previous night's actions, so I just sit by her and watch everyone be high on LSD. Eventually I'm talking about how I have a job interview and how I need the car for it, then she kicks me out of her dorm because she thinks I only look for myself.

Later that night she's talking about how she wonders if we're a good couple; keep in mind we basically lived with one another up until this point, all of our friends thought we're a cute couple, we share a car (it's hers though) and a cat (she got it because ESA at colleges), and then says how her high self has decided to ""forgive"" me and ""move on."" The next day we go to the dining hall where she badgers me for being mentally ill, ""too dominate,"" and how I need help, and if I ever do what I did again she'd break up with me and get me arrested. Then that night we have sex.

After all this her ex (he lives back in our hometown, so it's not like he's nearby but still) that continually hits her up from time to time, mostly to hit on her, starts texting her and they start texting all the time about memes and all the like. Then my girlfriend goes on this rant about how she feels like she's walking on eggshells me with because she can't be ""open"" like talking to that guy "" as a friend"" and wanting to be a dancer at a nightclub or a stripper, and feels like she can't be open about her sexuality around me because I didn't want to be around her friends at a sex store looking for vibrators. Keep in mind my girlfriend has had a lot of bad dreams/fears she's told me about where she fears I'd go back to ***my*** ex, and after I asked her last night if she'd be ok if I started being friends with my ex again, she said she ""wouldn't care,"" which honestly I thought was horse crap.

Anyway, after all this, she still asks me to help her buy Halloween decorations and help keep her bank account over $0, all the while debating on whether if I care about her or not and how hurt she is.

We share a car, cat, basically all our friends, etc. and I honestly have no idea what to do. I feel trapped since I rely on her so much and the fact that the incident mentioned earlier occurred, and there's still over a month left in the semester before I could dip (the school is pretty expensive so in the long run I'd be saving money).

Should I stick through this? She described it as an ""extreme depressive episode"" even though she said the LSD helped more than any therapist (and refuses to go see one or take any medication), or should I bail? Or am I just being a horrible boyfriend? A lot of my friends have said that I need to get out of here, but after thinking about that a lot, I have realized I love her more than anything and it's gonna be extremely difficult to get past here.

Need advice/guidance, please.","Hi RA - I'm considering ending my relationship and I need advice because I don't know what's holding me back besides not wanting to hurt someone's feelings. We've been together almost a year. I feel as though my bf (29M) and I (31F) are in two completely different stages of life. When we started this relationship, I said to myself that I'd give him time. But time has passed and literally nothing has changed.

I work a normal office job 8:30am-5pm m-f, I have a 11 year old daughter, and I rent my own apartment (saving to buy something hopefully within the next 5 years). My life is pretty stable and routine. My bf works 2 nights a week as waiter, lives with his parents, and during the day he is a music producer. However, the music does not generate income because he has not played a show in almost a year. Over the past year, he complains constantly about his job and how he wants to get a new one, but never does it. He refuses to get out of the restaurant industry or work more hours a week. He makes little to no effort to play shows to generate income with his music. I don't see his life changing any time in the near future.

We've had conversations about the future, about what I want from a relationship (he said he wants the same things, stability, long term commitment, financial independence etc) but he hasn't done a single thing to change his life. I know that I have no say in what he does with his life and I shouldn't judge someone for being on a different path than me, but I don't think I want to continue a relationship with someone who does not make any effort to grow and become independent.

t3_dlpssh,My Fianc√© [29/m] broke it off with me [32/f] to work on anger issues... do I wait?,"Long story short, the past few weeks his anger has been pretty bad... like, seeing red over losing sunglasses or not being able to find a hat right away.


He's never gotten violent, and he's not angry to me, but he gets really beside himself and yells and cusses and gets pretty mad for a bit but i've been able to talk him down and calm him down and help him with whatever the problem is.


3 weeks ago something happened between he and his mom, and he lost it. wouldn't talk to me all day (but was talking to a friend of his, so I knew he was ok). come 7:30pm I get a text saying ""this relationship is over for me. i can't keep lying to myself, i know i need help and i can't get help when i'm always worrying about you. this is the hardest thing i've ever had to do, i'm sorry.""


come this past saturday, he finally called me after 2 weeks of no contact and told me to come get my things because seeing them everyday hurt him too much. phone call was about 45min, of him saying he knows he has an issue and needs therapy and needs help and that he still loves me, etc. so i go over there and he is BROKEN, crying the whole time... i've never seen someone look so sad and so lost. he wound up hugging me a few times, telling me he still loves me, telling me he needs to get the help and he is too toxic for a relationship right now and doesn't want to hurt me but needs the time apart to fix himself.


of course, i will wait. i tell him that, and he says ""but i don't know how long it'll take"", which i understand... but i'm not just gonna move on from the person i'm in love with.


is it stupid to wait? i feel like if i don't, i'm abandoning my person. engagement/marriage is about supporting and loving your partner through good times or bad, so i will wait... he said he hasn't drank in 2 weeks (not a huge drinker, but even a few beers i don't think it really does him any good) so i know he's making steps to try to better himself. i feel like if he really gives therapy a try, hopefully in a few months things will be better and he'll be back.

t3_dlsqdg,"I am a 23 F engaged to a 37 F, the constant nitpicking is ruining our relationship","We have been together for three  years. I pursued her because she is everything I look for in a woman. Intelligent, kind, genuine, beautiful. She is very career driven and extremely task oriented. We have lived together for about a year.

On the other hand, I‚Äôm very ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù and not so rigid. I get all my tasks done and I‚Äôm very driven also, but I don‚Äôt feel like things need to be done a ‚Äúspecific way‚Äù like my fianc√© does. She says she admires how carefree I am about the small stuff, however I am at my wits end with the constant nagging over what I think are trivial things.

For example:

When I park my career, my fianc√©e is constantly fearful I‚Äôm going to hit another car, she‚Äôs always giving me ‚Äúpointers‚Äù on how to park better. I‚Äôve never been in a car accident, or hit another car. She gets overwhelmed and frustrated whenever I park the car.

The other day I put up fairy lights in our backyard and she read the instructions on the box and questioned me for about 20 minutes about what we were going to do if it rained: I kept explaining that they were outdoor lights and I had the extension cord undercover but she was insistent that it was ‚Äúdangerous, but it looks really nice‚Äù. 


Last night I was hanging out our washing and when she saw it she nitpicked about how I should space out the washing more so it doesn‚Äôt smell. I‚Äôve never had smelly washing or issues of clothes not drying my entire life but she constantly feels the need to point out how I can do things ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. I.e. her way.

There have been times where the way that I wash dishes has been called into question. Sometimes when this happens I laugh because I find it so ridiculous. She got so frustrated that after scouring dishes from a dinner party I missed a slight amount of grease off a pan. She then proclaimed that ‚ÄúI just leave dishes dirty‚Äù.

We have argued endlessly about this, she believes that she is just trying to help me become better at things and instead it makes me feel infantilised and incapable; inadequate as a partner in our partnership. I have told her this and she says the things I do frustrate her because they can be done in a more efficient manner. As you can see by my writing, I go out of my way to do chores - but to absolutely no benefit to anyone else because I‚Äôm never praised - always getting ‚Äúcorrective training‚Äù absolutely nothing turns me off more than this.

It has been only a month and we go on dates no type of sex not spending the night with each other just taking things slow. It‚Äôs as if I now have to prove myself over again and out my ego aside. 

She is receptive to me but it can go from hot to cold very quickly. One minute it‚Äôs like nothing happens then she is distant. Is this what comes with having to build back trust?

What‚Äôs are somethings I can do besides be transparent and honest ? Is giving her space to feel how she feels good? Should I complain if I feel she is being distant? I also feel my insecurities get in the way since I did what I did maybe she is just having me around as payback.

t3_dlspz6,Boyfriend 22 [M] wants to move out with me 21 [F] but I have doubts.,"Firstly, I don‚Äôt doubt the relationship at all we‚Äôve been together for five years and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.  We are both so trusting of each other, we give each other the right amount of space and attention, and sex life is great. 

We see each other twice a week which is why I think it works because on the 2 days (usually after 6 because that‚Äôs when I finish work)  we see each other we just wanna spend it with each other. 

Now dilemma is we both live at home and he‚Äôs graduating from university at the end of the year and he‚Äôs considering moving out.  In the middle next year (assuming my financial situation doesn‚Äôt change fingers crossed) I‚Äôm hoping to purchase a flat/apartment which I‚Äôll be doing alone- this has been my dream since I started working and have saved heaps but I never expected him to contribute to the deposit, and even if he wanted too he‚Äôs got about 3k saved anyway. 

My bf has expressed interest in moving into my flat when I buy it and he‚Äôs offered to contribute to rent/mortgage repayments. My concern is that when we move out together it‚Äôs not gonna be the same and the time spent together isn‚Äôt going to be as special. Because we only see each other twice a week like we just wanna have sex as soon as we get into the bedroom, cuddle up watching movies and spend hours talking about our respective weeks. I feel like this just won‚Äôt happen because we‚Äôll see each other everyday. I love our routine and I feel it just won‚Äôt wanna change it (don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken kinda deal). 

For example, I know my boyfriend watches porn and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it as long as he doesn‚Äôt put porn and wanking before me. And when we see each other of course (well I‚Äôd like to think so) he just wants to have sex with me and I‚Äôm just worried that‚Äôll fizzle out too. Like I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll  come home one day wanting to have sex and he‚Äôd already had a wank and I know I‚Äôd take that personally.

Edit 1: I obviously love him and will I hope one day marry him I‚Äôm just wondering how other couples make the step and how you keep your relationship fresh (can‚Äôt think of a better word lol) and I of course I will  move out with him one day but I‚Äôm just not ready atm

t3_dlspmm,Cannot regain trust in relationships nor find balance within myself anymore,"Sorry for the lengthy story. I've never been the jealous type. In fact I was always super loose about how non commital I was. I never wanted long relationships nor marriage. But then I got married under trying and tragic circumstances. I took that quite seriously as it was a once in a lifetime decision. The marriage was chaotic, turned abusive and took a turn for the worst- in every way. I transgressed my boundaries day to day because commitment has a promise I made to the other person in any condition and stayed until my life and others I knew were in physical danger. He had a slew of conditions, alcoholism, bi polar and split personality. 
In this time I still was able to focus on myself and work on my life. Eventually he broke me down to my base components and weakend me as a simple animal with no place left to run. I still carry this with me to this day. He also cheated on me and that was barely the worst of it all. He destroyed me.

After running away I found myself involved with a handsome guy who I just wanted to be with for fun but who forced me into a long term relationship and tried to make me part of his long-term plans. I can see all he wanted was to satisfy his ego. He played with my head and I knew it, I took him up on it and he kept on going on with his womanizing, and lacivious ways. He did not cheat but every day I found pictures of women, local ones in his feed. I found myself slowly losing the battle to my own decency and looking through his stuff and killing myself inside. He kept pushing to have a family non stop and be together forever. I felt it was bullshit all. the. way. through. I called him out on it yet stayed way too long for my mental health.

Leaving him was easily one of the best things I've ever done. He was manipulative, deceptive and sociopathic, he 'tested' me, confined me in his 'opinions of the world' and pressed daily to stay in this shitty relationship. 

I've been in better relationships, one where I know what respect means, and at one point in my life.. these two people respected me as well. I was treated well. where do I go wrong? Did I stay past all the red flags? Did I trust the person and not the actions? 
 for some reason, I couldn't say no anymore, I could not abandon the idea of things improving and that's a fight I was fighting for, maybe not even the person but the idea.

These days, I distrust all men and it is crippling, I am triggered all the time. I can't function at all in my daily life when I'm in a relationship and every guy seems partially evil to me. I saw the good and when it was bad, it was a nightmare. I can't stop generalizing men and I can't believe that any of them dont have supreme narcissistic desires. I saw two people literally transform before my eyes. One was overt, the other was blatantly living or wanting to live in two realities and show me one face. I saw it all
I don't know what to do. I don't know how to give anyone else a chance anymore without seeing their faces on the/a new person. Scarier yet, to see their faces on my own and knowing I've kept the worst bits of them despite not wanting to. I struggle to find the carefree person I was once, the monster I've become and ever looking at anyone with trust ever again, seething with jealousy. 
I know therapy therapy blah blah blah. I want to hear some insight. Anyone gone through loss of identity with this or new malice for people overall? How did/do you deal with it?

t3_dlsp5g,How should I feel? Am I a rebound or someone he may genuinely like?,"So Its my first time actually ""talking"" to a guy, and I had a huge crush on the certain guy last year. As it turns out he likes me too! So I feel like I should be feeling different emotions.

Please hear this story out:

I've liked him for about a year in the grand scheme of things. Last year I hurt myself by liking him because I knew he liked someone else, I tried so hard to stop liking him so much but it's like my heart didn't want to give up on him. It was the weirdest thing because I've never actually liked someone before. So it broke me knowing he liked someone else. Throughout the summer I pretty much got over him or at least was trying to, my heart still missed him but I told myself it was just infatuation.

Main part lol:

Last month he asked a girl to hoco in front of  our entire grade. And she rejected him. I felt really upset but I didn't want to hurt him even more so I just kept to myself and didn't try and show him my feelings, although we had been close for a while beforehand. 
Fast forward to now, we have been ""talking"" for 22 days. I can't help but feel like a rebound and that hurts a lot, especially considering how much I liked him in the past, and how much I do now. He's super affectionate with me but I feel like everyone will think I'm a rebound at school or judge me for liking him. I must seem like a pretty awful person for feeling this way. It's not like I don't like him I'm just so afraid of him not actually liking me and having myself look so dumb. He compliments me all the time is super into PDA but is he just using me for attention?

 But honestly...I just wish he liked me before he liked her. I've told him about how I feel before and he said that I wasnt a rebound but what else am I suppose to think? He just got over her that quick? Is that possible to do? I don't know what I'm doing..

I really have no one that really understands my feelings. My parents would get mad at me for thinking like this, none of my friends want to listen to me talking about my personal life..but I'm hoping someone may help me, if not then this was a good way to let some of my feelings out haha

Tl;dr:

Dating advice, insecure (15f) ranting about (16m), I feel like he is using me to have a girlfriend. I think I'm his rebound but I don't know.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsosv,"I don't like the way i used to argue (maybe toxic), and already decided to change, but for some reason i need to understand more","**TLDR**: I used to argue in a certain way, after thinking about it, i realized whether it is toxic or not, i don't want to do it this way anymore because it can be hurtful. I already made my choice, but for some reason, i have a urge to understand this a little better. Specially from people that left a toxic relationship in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Names and ages were changed. I'm in my thirties, all my SO were around my age.

&amp;#x200B;

Before starting, i know it was not fair to expect someone to argue the way i expected. I regret doing it, and it was a honest mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alice**

I have been in a long relationship with Alice (more than 7 years together), where we used to argue in a certain way when there were feelings involved. It was never a problem (or maybe it was but she never told me, and i failed to see it myself. We also broke up for unrelated reasons). I know every person is different, but since it worked well, i never thought about it until now. I thought a little empathy lead naturally to this (which is wrong, i know)

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever **A** did or say something that hurt the feelings of **B**, **B** ""deserved"" an explanation and an apology. Using a tone of voice that showed negative emotions, making questions in an accusatory way or saying hurtful things was ""understandable"" and forgiven by **A**

&amp;#x200B;

We never talked about it, it was just how we argued. Every argument was different but in general, they looked like this: I do something that hurts Alice, she becomes visible upset and maybe say something hurtful. I apologize (sometimes immediately, just for doing something that hurt her feelings) after that, i try to understand the problem and apologize again (this time because i understood the problem and how it made her feel), and finally i explain the reason i did what i did. She then apologizes for reacting the way she reacted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jane**

Few years after things ended with Alice, i met Jane.

&amp;#x200B;

I never questioned the way i used to argue, until i realized how Jane was reacting. She gave no explanations, sometimes an apology that never sounded honest, and at some point she started crying. Seeing her cry broke my heart, so i automatically ended the argument each time, and moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while she told me the way i argue is hurtful, and it reminds her of her ex (toxic relationship, ended many years ago) and she gets anxious when we argue, which i understand, and explains why she reacted like that.

&amp;#x200B;

She also told me that when I'm upset, i **need** to make the other person feel bad, crying or at least visible sad (which is not true, it may help me not feel upset anymore, but it breaks my heart) and this also reminds her of her ex.

&amp;#x200B;

I think she is talking about the arguments where i didn't get what i thought it was a honest apology and no explanation at all. So i demanded both in a way i regret now, but before thinking about the way i was used to argue it felt like a reasonable thing to do. We also had a few arguments where i was very hurt and made questions in an accusatory way (i also regret this)

&amp;#x200B;

Is Jane analyzing my behavior and being extra careful to avoid being in a toxic relationship again? Or maybe they way i used to argue is just toxic?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way once i started questioning the way i argue, i realized i don't want to do it this way anymore, but i just would like to have a better understand of this.",relationship_advice
t3_dlso97,I (32F) don't feel desired by my boyfriend (30M),"This thing has been bugging me for a few months now and it's become pretty painful so I can't ignore it anymore.
We've been together for 3 years now, we get along great, like what one thinks, other does but the sex thing is the only thing that is not as good as the rest.
We have sex few times a week, and to be clear, that's fine by me. I'm not asking for more, I'm missing the flirting part. Our sex is now a routine, we go to bed, he scrolls on his phone and then asks me if I want to have sex. 
We barely kiss, just small kiss when we get home from work, he mostly touches me just to tickle my nose or ears, so nothing sexually connected. 
I miss him looking at me with desire, like he used to do. I miss having spontaneous sex, I miss him grabbing my ass as he passes me by, I miss those kind of things. 
And I've been trying talking for a few times, he says he understands but nothing changes much. He says he loves me and thinks I'm supersexy but he just doesn't show me. And I'm getting frustrated and I know I'm probably getting annoying.
Also, I tried to bring the old spark.
For example, last week I tried to spice things up and I sent him a naked selfie in black lace lingerie while he was at work and his reaction was: ""wow, you look really nice"". Nothing that he thinks I'm hot, how he would like to see me like that when he gets home,etc. And he actually used to ask for my pictures, we were sexting etc. 
I tried talking to him later that night that his comment seemed distant, and he became defensive, like what more do I want, me being sensitive again, what else could he possibly say. 
I also tried dressing up in sexy lingerie and started kissing him and he was lost, like he was confused, didn't know what to do and asked me does that mean we have to have sex now? Any time I make some sexual reference, he's like: ""oh no, you're horny again"".
I don't now what to do anymore, I feel really hurt, now I'm losing my will to have sex, I sometimes even feel used after we have sex. And in everything else we get along so nicely, I don't want our relationship to fail because of this.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsn9y,Almost everyone thinks my boyfriend is a pedophile because I look young and it started to ruin our relationship,"He looks like 30, while I look like I'm 12. In fact we're both 24.

Whenever we go to the cinema/zoo/anywhere for a date people stare and at least 2-3 people come up to him and tells him he's sick and shouldn't do these kind of things with a kid. It's annoying, so we don't go out much, but I don't really mind.

The problem is : last week someone told him that it doesn't matter how old I am, if I look like I'm 12 he is a pedophile, cause he sleeps with someone who looks like a minor. Since then we haven't...and he said he doesn't know if he can. Or what if he really is a pedophile. I know he isn't, lookswise I'm not even his type (we were friends for 2 years before we got together, that's how I know).

I don't know how to help him, it seems like everything I say just make things worst. I'd appreciate any advise, even if it's just a guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I do get confrontational about it and I would like to understands what's going on in his head as I got no idea and I can't say more that ""just ignore it, they know nothing"". He said I don't understand what's his problem and I really don't and tat's my real problem.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsn6h,How do I (22F) deal with my mother (52F) crossing boundaries?,"I (22F) have issues with my mom‚Äôs (52F) boundaries at work, seeing as though we work together. Previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlsbxj/how_do_i_22f_deal_with_working_with_a_family/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) about her. But these issues have extended to my entire life since before I started working there. Feel free to help a girl out about tips on dealing with her at work over there. BUT here is some stuff I would love to get advice on:

*1. Social media privacy:*

She likes to share personal accomplishments/milestones about me without asking first. (i.e I had a bat mitzvah as an adult and when I got my new job). I like to announce if/when I‚Äôm ready. Last time she told me I didn‚Äôt like it, she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù 

She listed my close friend in the Facebook post about my new job because she got a new job at the same time. My friend wasn‚Äôt telling people yet. 

She posted my flight number when I went on my first solo flight years ago. Wouldn‚Äôt remove it until I refused to show her pictures of my trip. 

Posted private baby photos before the parents (my brother, her son) were ready. 

And MORE. 

*2. Bedroom privacy:*

For safety (special needs sibling) we got indoor doors that can be unlocked from the outside.  She walks into my locked bedroom without knocking CONSTANTLY. 

I am a very neat person. My stuff is organized the way I need it. She reorganizes so nothing is on the floor or table, etc. and shoves it in closets. Claims she was organizing, really just made it a lot worse. I lost $150 shoes this way, spent 45 minutes crying while looking for them. Don‚Äôt worry, found them. 

Takes my clothes without asking. We have very different body types. She stretches shirts out in the stomach and I stretch shirts out in the breast area. Ruins $20 shirts that I pay for. 

Demanded that I throw away my old clothes and replace them with expensive ones. Can‚Äôt seem to explain to her that I would be happy to, if she pays. Otherwise, I‚Äôm glad to wait until I save up. 

She does, however, go through my things to monitor what I purchase. While she wants me to get new clothes, if I do, I get yelled at for wasting money. 

*3. Chronically makes fun of my health habits:*

Look, I‚Äôm pretty healthy. I eat OK and exercise. I go to the gym and take yoga classes twice a week. I hiked all the way down and up the Grand Canyon last year. She constantly calls me fat and belittles any of my health goals. If I eat one cookie, she constantly tells people that I‚Äôve been eating cookies all week. 

She‚Äôs on a new diet. Apparently I can‚Äôt eat any simple sugar EVER since she can‚Äôt. But in a month or two, I can‚Äôt eat any fat EVER since she won‚Äôt so whatever. 

*4. She doesn‚Äôt fix anything once I tell her I am hurt by her:*

I have brought all of these up using wording like ‚ÄúI feel.‚Äù As in ‚ÄúI feel upset when you take my clothes without asking.‚Äù I‚Äôve also thrown in the whole ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary inappropriate to monitor my activity at work.‚Äù 

Usually ends in:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your mom, I care about you‚Äù

‚ÄúI pay for you to live here‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, pay rent‚Äù * doesn‚Äôt accept rent *

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have many more things that I haven‚Äôt mentioned in this post. I don‚Äôt want to be an ungrateful daughter, housemate, or whatever. They do let me live rent free. They pay for my food and various insurances. They are the ones who pushed me to move back in and refuse to take money from me. I‚Äôm super grateful. I do all the remaining chores (they have someone to do most of them for us, whether I‚Äôm living there or not). I go pick up the groceries, take my sibling to school/doctors appointments, I cook dinner, etc. 

My personal solution is to pay them rent (covers living, utilities, food, amenities) and put a lock on my door. No dice. Not allowed. Moving out is financially not an option. 

tldr; how do I deal with my mom invading my privacy constantly when talking to her about it doesn‚Äôt work?",relationship_advice

t3_dlpnok,Mismatched libido issues between me (F20) and partner (21M) of 2 years,"Hi Reddit, 

I have been dating my partner for just over 2 years. In the beginning our sex life was amazing. Multiple times a day, adventurous with positions and it was just great.  

Then around the 1 year mark it just started going down on my end. I was stressed, I had some health issues which I'm still dealing with even now. 
- iron deficiency 
- anemic 
- vit d deficiency
Just to name a few. 

My partner has a much higher libido than me and I take full responsibility for my libido as it is based on my health the way it is right now. 

He understands this but sometimes he tries to initiate sex, I would say 80% of the time I just am not up to it. 
I can see the annoyance in his face and then he goes all quiet or gets up to do his own thing when we were just nicely cuddling on the couch or something. 

I don't know what I can do to make myself want to have sex more because it honestly drains me to even think about it and the way my health is going it just is way too much for my body. 

Okay! This is long, sorry! I guess my main question/advice ask is

How do low libido partners work up the strength or effort to try ""match"" their partners?

t3_dlslni,Boyfriend avoidant and is sabotaging the relationship.,"I (25f) and my boyfriend (30m) have been together for almost a year. Initially our relationships started out as polyamorous. I had another partner and we opened our relationship and that‚Äôs when I started dating my current boyfriend. The other relationship is over now and I have told my current boyfriend that I really want to develop a deep connection with him, so I‚Äôm basically going back to being monogamous. 

He has a lot of childhood trauma from being emotionally neglected, and he seems to pendulate between being anxiously attached and avoidant. I also have trauma from neglect, but the neglect i received was much more subtle and i didn‚Äôt even realize it was neglect until a therapist pointed it out. My parents are very controlling and they would try to manipulate me to do things they think are best for me. So their love has always been very conditional. I have an anxious attachment style that stems from this, and I‚Äôm constantly worried that people will stop loving me if I do something they don‚Äôt like. 

A few months ago, when I was still dating both partners, my boyfriend that I‚Äôm still with told me that he can‚Äôt handle being poly anymore. It was a very emotional discussion and we were both in ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve love‚Äù mode. I ended up breaking up with him, because I thought that‚Äôs what he was saying he wanted. I thought he was telling me he wanted to break up because he couldn‚Äôt handle me being in a relationship with someone else. Up to this point in the relationship, my boyfriend had been extremely open with me. He was able to be totally vulnerable with me  and really leaned into the connection. I loved it. But it was one-sided. I didn‚Äôt really ever let him in because I was very uncomfortable with vulnerability and I would rather meet his needs and make him feel loved. In retrospect, it was very codependent and almost like a parent-child relationship. And actually, when I broke up with him, it caused him to feel like he was literally, physiologically dying. His therapist said it‚Äôs something that sometimes happens with people who have a lot of trauma from infancy. It seems that he attached to me in a way that he was never able to attach to his mother. So I was sort of a combination mother and girlfriend. And when I broke up with him, he relived that trauma. So in short, I really fucked him up. 

A few days later, after a ton of talking to our respective friends and therapists, we ended up getting back together. I guess it took a breakup for me to realize how much I did want to invest in the relationship. And ever since then, I‚Äôve been the one being totally vulnerable. I‚Äôve allowed him to see me in emotional states that I‚Äôve NEVER allowed people to see me in. And he‚Äôs been great about supporting me in that. But since I hurt him so badly when we broke up, he is most definitely holding back from me, and I can feel it all the time. Our relationship is still very playful and loving, but he has been able to open up to me, but I can always tell that he‚Äôs holding part of himself back. It almost feels like he‚Äôs trying to be the caretaker for me now. But I don‚Äôt want a caretaker; I want a partner. 

So the other night, we had a pretty big fight. I mentioned that I still haven‚Äôt told me parents about breaking up with my other partner. They were NOT supportive of my being polyamorous and they practically hated the partner I broke up with because he is very outspoken about politics and they butt heads over that. When my boyfriend learned that I hadn‚Äôt told my parents yet, he immediately shut down emotionally. He thought it meant that I thought he was replaceable somehow, or that I didn‚Äôt care about him. I tried to explain that it‚Äôs not about him, it‚Äôs about the complicated relationship I have with my parents. I can‚Äôt handle the judgment and ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù from them about the failed polyamorous relationship. But he was in defense mode at this point and he said some hurtful things to me about how I‚Äôm just not owning my decisions. He even sort of laughed at me like I was silly for it. Sometimes he‚Äôll try to out-trauma me. Since my trauma is less obvious, my family does appear to be ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù especially to my boyfriend, who has never felt love of any kind from his own family. He reacted so coldly to me and it set off the anxiety I have of being loved if I do something wrong. I ended up having a panic attack right there in front of him, which I had never done before. He held me and tried to comfort me but it wasn‚Äôt very comforting considering the emotionless state he was in. 

I know this defense state he is in is because he is afraid of losing me. He even told me that‚Äôs what it is. I‚Äôve explained in every possible way that I can that i love him and I want this relationship with him. I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do because right now I‚Äôm being very anxiously attached by asking for reassurance and getting clingy when he can‚Äôt give it to me, and he is being avoidant by dissociating and avoiding showing me how he feels. He said he‚Äôs so cknvinced that I‚Äôm going to leave because he‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to love‚Äù and everyone leaves eventually. But that‚Äôs not what I want.

I feel like I‚Äôm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll be able to tolerate being shut out from his emotional world. It hits me directly in my own trauma of feeling unworthy of love. The last thing I want to do is leave him, but at this point he‚Äôs sabotaging himself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Is there any way for me to help him feel safe in the relationship without putting my own self worth on the line?

t3_dlpkog,Would you say that ending a relationship the second time is easier?,"So basically I(21f) ended my relationship once and we(22m) got back together, I am just curious if it is easier to end it the second time? I feel like in some ways maybe it is because your partner went through it once and realizes it must just not be working, and can come to terms with it more?

I am aware this issue probably is situational, but I personally think it can be easier just because the person ending it has more confidence that it is over, since they gave it another shot, there is less guilt that you could be ending it for the wrong reasons. I also believe that it isn't just a bomb that is being dropped on you both and that it can be understood a bit more.",relationship_advice

t3_dlsj51,Is friendship still possible with the girl (26) who rejected me (30)?,"I had wanted to become a celibate Buddhist monk (still do), so I had purposely not chase girls. Unfortunately, hormones and undisciplined thoughts made me fall in love with a girl. 

We went for a youth camp together, a hiking retreat. Location in Malaysia. 

She's a Buddhist too, and knows of my monkhood intention and on Valentine's this year, after knowing her for 1 year+ I confessed via text. There was no reply for 3 days, by which I take it to mean rejection, and wished to confirm it. She texted back that we will always just remain as friends. I replied that I am glad, for I still have no intention to marry. 

I tried then to abandon all my feelings for her, it's still an ongoing process. However, just last weekend, we went together on a group trip to another state for donating food to monks. During the 2 days trip, I tried my best to talk to others, not stick to her, but end up still got to talk to her quite a bit more than anyone else as my cravings are still there. I sensed a sort of aversion reaction from her that she's less responsive compared to a normal friend, but maybe that's my craving speaking for wanting more reaction from her. She still smiles at me if I smile at her. 

I dunno if even remaining as friends is possible anymore if I seem to be just hurting her by interacting with her. Maybe it's that I hurt her by she thinking that she hurt me if she becomes more warm to me, it would rekindle my crush on her. 

She also has frequently updated status on her whatsapp. Today, some of the status is: cutting people out of my life doesn't mean I hate them, it means I respect myself. 

I previously asked her on status relating to relationships and she said it's for a friend, nothing to do with us. 

So what should I do? Should I reply to her status update to say I am sorry I seem to hurt you, that I am trying my best to reduce and abandon the residual love attachment I had for her? (I am a conservative romantic who prefers to get a girlfriend for marriage material, not for casual fling, so the falling in love is deep.) If she wants, we can just not interact. Or just ignore her the next time we meet?

t3_dlsifa,My boyfriend cheated at the start of the relationship,"The tittle quite sums up the story, we hooked up on november last year and slowly fell into a relationship around December, around that time we had agreed this would end soon as I(F19) was leaving for school in February. 

However by February we were both too attached and decided we'd travel every other weekend to see each other and keep the relationship alive, slowly we fell for the other and the relationship started to become quite domestic, to the point we've sort of talked about living together if it weren't because neither can move to the others city. We're 11 months this Thursday, and haven't ever fought for more than a day, every problem being solved within the same day and often in less than an hour. Almost perfect relationship with the ocassional issue here and there. 

It all brings us to yesterday, I'm staying with him(M23) because I'm on a small break and we went out on the weekend, he gave me his phone to search some photos and a video I asked him to send to me and I ended up stumbling upon some compromising videos. 

Two with sexual contents with a girl that's obviously not me (dated December 16th and January 23rd) and some other casual videos (girl recording him while he does homework and she teases him at home, and same girl recording him while teasing him at a restaurant both dated somewhere in December). 

I immediately showed him what I found, but couldn't really ask because of ugly crying. 

He kept apologizing over and over again. 

In the end, I think I'm gonna forgive him, after all by those dates we weren't really serious and it wasn't supposed to last more than a few months. 

But I don't know how to shake the feeling of hurt and betrayal, like I got really invested from the very beginning and he didn't. And it hurts. It hurts so much. 

Even with that I don't want to end the relationship, as I have no reasons to believe he's done anything since I left for school and started traveling (I feel the relationship for serious by that time) and he doesn't behave as a cheater, idk how to explain that bit. 

He's since deleted all of them, and he seemed to not even know what those videos were. And, even if I sound stupid, I still trust him. And I want to put it behind and forget about it for the sake of our relation. 

I just want advice regarding how to put it behind me, and not feel so hurt about those videos and what they mean.",relationship_advice
t3_dlph37,Was my ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù healthy?,"hello! i need advice on something.

over a year ago i had a friend that i wanted to go out with. she did some of the following things and i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs justified or not to be healthy-

she insisted to walk far behind me because she said she has friends in the neighborhood and doesn‚Äôt want people to think we were together. i expressed that it hurt me and when i tried to walk by her, she wouldn‚Äôt let me.

she would tell me for weeks she wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to date. eventually she said no but still came over. she told me she didn‚Äôt want to cuddle anymore. i still wanted to, and she would cuddle but then tell me later ‚Äúno more‚Äù and put it on me like it wasn‚Äôt a two-way thing. she would even initiate it sometimes. it left me confused. people in my life told me it was a ‚Äúpush-pull‚Äù dynamic. she would do one thing and do another.

she had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that got after her for hanging out with me. when he found out i gave her a hickey, he went OFF on her cussing her out saying he should‚Äôve been her first for everything. but this guy already did tons of stuff with other girls. he was controlling and toxic. she insisted that he‚Äôs usually not like that and she sent him paragraphs to talk to her again. he talked shit behind her back about her with her ex too.

i told her i wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to her anymore if she lets this toxic person back into her life (i don‚Äôt want to be friends with people who lavish in toxic relationships). when she started talking to him again i cut it off.

i do feel terrible for trying to kiss her one time. she said no and i was persistent, but then i laid off. i felt bad for being persistent for wanting to kiss her that moment.

she would get in a lot of drama. i felt confused because i felt like i was getting mixed signals (sent me pics once, would cuddle with me then shove me away the next).

before i cut her off she ‚Äúaccused‚Äù me of forcing her to cuddle with her, even though i usually initiated, she initiated before too, and left me confused. i thought sure i was persistent but never forceful, i thought respected boundaries.

months later she said she needed me to help her because she was going through a panic attack, so i was there for her, then she just stopped responding and didn‚Äôt care for me.

am i just being irrational? was this stuff justified and healthy? i‚Äôm left with a lot of uncertainty and uncomfortable and wanted a second opinion.

So here we go.

I(M18) am currently a recruit in the Army with two good friends of mine both same age as me.
One of those friends house I've been to a lot seeing as we are actually neighbours. 
He has two sisters one of with I'll call C (F25)
I've always had a good friendly relationship with C, but about half a year ago it turned into a crush.
C had a boyfriend and obviously the big Sis of my friend. So I never intended to even make a move. And just tried to ignore it.

Skip ahead a good 3 months to now still got a crush that just kept growing and she broke up with her boyfriend around two months ago and has been through a couple of dates.
A few days ago I went to a party and she was there to. We talked and she actually confessed to me about having feelings for me that started when she was still with her now ex.

The post is getting long so I'll get to the point.
C and I really do like each other but we both think her brother and of cource my friend  wouldn't approve. What do I do?

t3_dlsevt,How do I (F20) get my boyfriend (M20) to stop being a doormat and start challenging me more?,"This probably sounds like a weird situation but hear me out. 

I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for a little over a month. We‚Äôre both in college and have been friends for a while and started seeing each other a few months ago. I feel like he has always liked me more than I like him.. I was the one who was hesitant to date at first because of bad breakups in the past and I frankly wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked him enough to date. He finally asked me out and I said yes and it‚Äôs been great ever since. He is the kindest person I know and would literally do anything for me but I feel like that is sort of the problem. I feel like something is missing in our relationship and I think it‚Äôs that he is -too- nice. I know it sounds weird and ungrateful because a lot of girls my age are in the complete opposite situation. But I just wish he gave me more pushback sometimes. We‚Äôve never been in an argument, not even in the slightest. I‚Äôm the kind of person who has always been into douche bags/fuck boys and he is the first guy I‚Äôve been with who isn‚Äôt one. But it‚Äôs not even that I want him to become an asshole, I just want him to challenge me more. He‚Äôs told me before that he doesn‚Äôt think he could ever be mad at me, that I could be mad at him but unless I did something extreme like cheat on him he could never be mad at me. 

How do I get him to be less of a doormat in our relationship? I want things to be a little more spicy (for lack of better words) like I want to feel a spark or have some sort of mystery‚Äî because right now I feel like I could tell him the earth is flat and he would believe me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlseb0,My (20/F) BF (20/M) has been living off of me for over 9 months *long post*,"My bf ran away from his parents December 2018 (a longish story there), and had to drop out uni. At that point we had been close friends for 2.5 years and dating for 1-2 years (another long story). We've been living together for as long as we've been friends, so I know him, his personality, and habits pretty well. In the simplest terms, he's a lazy cunt who tends to get away with everything. We've planned for his running away somewhat, and knew that it wouldn't be easy, especially since I live alone and my parents doesn't know anything.  
For the first 3 months, I let him slack off, but he just kept pushing back whatever schedule I throw at him. He didn't have a complete and updated resume until end of March 2019. He finally started looking at jobs in April/May. It lasted maybe a month before he stopped cuz no one replied. During this entire time, we'd been living off of my living expenses from my parents and my part-time job. I had to go home during the summer and all he did, other than gaming and more gaming, was help us move... And he didn't even unpack. Actually, 1. his natural state of being is just gaming, random gaming social group, reddit/imgur, and sleep 2. Moving wasn't a huge deal since he looked at like three places and picked the one with the chillest owner and he got help from our friends as well 3. Nothing except his necessities (laptop, blanket, towel, and some clothes) was unpacked for a whole month. Anyway, so after I come back, which was the day before school starts again, I had to unpack, get groceries (since he ate either frozen food or simple sandwiches), and get ready for school.  
I'm currently in my last year of my degree, so I'm quite busy: school, part time, clubs/other activities, and yet my bf doesn't do any chores unless it's about half a day after asking him 8 times. Even worse is that he thinks his schedule is of higher priority than mine. For example, he would rather have me take the transit for 45+mins single way to go to work just so he could drive to his DnD sessions that are 2 times a week (we share one car and he doesn't have bus pass, also that's the only time he ever goes out of our place). I started volunteering today, which coincides with DnD, so he made me drop him off early at the DnD place before I go to the volunteering place, which is not on the way at all.  
On top of everything, he is still unemployed. Last week, I made him an ultimatum: he is to give up either pc/video games or DnD until he finds a job. Last week, he got out of it by looking for job for half an hour. This week, he got out of it by arguing that I said one particular game as opposed to all games. 
I'm so tired of this. I love him so much, and I know he does love me, but this is absolute bs. Every time I try something, either he shrugs it off, or retaliate against me with something worse. None of our friends have any way of dealing with it either. What can I do?

Tl;dr Bf is a couch potato who works me as a slave, and still haven't found a job after 'trying' for 9 months even though he's financially independent of his parents",relationship_advice
t3_dlse9r,Should I (M16) stick with a her (F16) or should I end it here rather than draw it out?,"I‚Äôm dating someone I never would‚Äôve expected to and honestly it still blows my mind I could be dating her. Basically cutting right to the meat, our relationship is starting to really lose focus. We‚Äôve gone from seeing each other once a week or every other week to not doing anything for just over a month. She‚Äôs moving, and she‚Äôs incredibly excited to leave our town as it isn‚Äôt quite the biggest for a city girl like herself. So I feel like I‚Äôm left here already all alone and it‚Äôs really taking a toll on me mentally. In the little fragments of time in which I see her (passing periods) she rarely acknowledges my existence and it really hurts not being able to speak that much with her at all. We try and chat online as much as possible but she‚Äôs said she isn‚Äôt prioritizing our relationship. Often when I ask if she‚Äôs available after school she says she can‚Äôt or she‚Äôs busy but sometimes she goes and hangs out with other people on the same day. I know I‚Äôm definitely clingy and the reason behind that is that my ex started seeing another guy near the end of our relationship and ended up leaving me for him. I‚Äôm not trying to make an excuse or anything here I just want any relevant information to be present. She also cannot take a hint as to my emotions. There are some times where I‚Äôll be down and I‚Äôll let her know I really need a hug or affection and she ends up basically ignoring me all the same. Often in lunch another couple we‚Äôre friends with will often point out I look in the dumps and she doesn‚Äôt really care about it.

TLDR: My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt prioritize my relationship, is moving soon and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge me in really any scenario anymore. Am I warping this in the wrong direction, or is this really just not a relationship suited for me?

Also please don‚Äôt disregard this due to age, I understand I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt fully grasp the intricacies of relationships but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsdi1,I (21F) confused about my boyfriend(21M) and best friend (21F) after our breakup,"This is a very emotionally confusing situation for me and am looking for external input/insight because I'm not sure if I'm justified in how I am currently feeling. 

I (21F) broke up with my boyfriend (21M) about 2 months ago. He is truly an incredible person but we went through a prolong rough spot where he acted in a hurtful way towards me that I just couldn't recover from. I felt immensely guilty about breaking up with him despite knowing it was the right decision for me, and this compounded with the fact that he received a lot of sympathy from both my friends and family post-breakup. 

I turned to my best friend (21F) to help me through this really complicated time even though I was having trouble expressing my feeling about the breakup. I was still in contact with my ex during this time because I was not being firm with my boundaries and felt very responsible for his emotions. He would ask to talk every single day and tell me how miserable he was and how I was the best thing that had ever happened to him and the guilt just piled up. I asked him again and again to please find a friend he could talk to other than me and encouraged him to go to counseling.

 It eventually came up that he had been talking to my best friend and that she was helping him through the breakup too. I felt really betrayed and when I brought it up with my best friend she said that she didn't want to tell me because she didn't want me to think she wasn't on my side.  I pretended like I was okay with it because I just wanted my ex to finally get help but it was really confusing. I felt like I couldn't really trust her with my feelings about the breakup because she was helping my ex through the same stuff and I felt like I didn't really have anyone truly on my side. She promised me she wouldn't tell him things that we talked about, but she would tell me things that he said so I just wasn't sure what would get back to him. My ex told me that my best friend expressed to him that she wished we would get back together, which just made me feel so awful and guilty. 

I am just feeling really confused and upset about the entire situation. I would have never tried to help a friend's ex  because I feel like that would be a conflict of interest and would be hurtful to my friend, but I'm not sure if it's inappropriate or not because my best friend was just trying to help out my ex.

t3_dlsd1p,My roommate (21f) got so angry she screamed at me (21F) but I'm not even really sure why,"Sorry for the length of the post in advance.

My roommate (F21) lets call her T, and I (F21) were getting ready to go to a party. We've been best friends since childhood and always ask each other for advice on what to wear, makeup, hairstyles, etc. We're both pretty adventurous with clothes and like dressing up, wearing things that make us feel attractive. I put on a really tight risqu√© crop top, and asked her if it was appropriate.  She made a disgusted face at me, but said it looked okay. I am really insecure about my body so this hurt and I was worried that it was too much, I looked fat, blah blah blah, the general insecurities. I just threw on a coat over it and decided that I liked it and if I felt judged I would just zip up my coat. So she gets ready, I tell her she looks great and we meet up with another friend, lets call them B, to buy alcohol and head to the party. 

At first, it was a great time. I getting tipsy, but by the time I had finished my cup, T was on her 4th or 5th and really drunk. She started saying passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, like backhanded compliments. I just laughed them off because she was drunk. Then the cops showed up, we're obviously over 21, but I knew there was a few 19 year olds there so the house owner's wanted everyone to be quiet and stay put. My friends and I were in a bedroom and T was angry saying she wanted to leave. She was snapping at B and I claiming we are always mean to her when she can do whatever she wants. The owners kept telling her to please be quiet and she could leave after the cops left. She left the room and I went to a different bedroom with my friends who lived there. At this point everyone was drunk and we were having heart-to-hearts about how much we enjoyed being friends with each other. I've always felt unwanted and this really made my night. T came back in, and seemed in a better mood and we danced and socialized with the few others in the bedroom. The cops finally left and T got angry again for some unknown reason, but mentioned she was annoyed that I was talking to boys (our mutual friends) and she couldnt find one that liked her. B and I told her to maybe socialize more and that she didn't need guys to like her but said she was leaving. B and I were still having fun so we said we would meet her back at home. 

 The party dies down a bit, and its just B, 2 other friends, and I in the backyard. We were having a conversation about relationships when T comes back. She sits down next to me, and joins in. At some point in the conversation, I bring up how I'm casually seeing my ex, and how I don't know whats going to happen between us. T gets so pissed and keeps saying he's bad for me, an jerk, I would be better off single. I explain that even though I've been upset by him in the past, we were both equally unhealthy to each other and are trying to fix that. She starts yelling that I'm wrong I'm wrong, and I ask her to please explain why because I don't understand why she's so angry about it. Her response is that nobody supports her talking to her ex (also I won't get into it, but her ex was really really bad to her). I *never* told her not to talk to him and I point that out. She agrees with me but is still super mad at yells that she's going home. 

B and I head to my home about an hour later, at which point T has been waiting for us. (Side note: B lives down the street from us, but isn't a roommate). My ex calls me right as I get home and asks me to come over. That annoys T so much and she goes off about how I'm toxic to live with, screaming at me. I still don't know why and I get angry back trying to understand, and she brings up bills. We split all utilities but she has been claiming I owe her for internet. I've been trying to explain for weeks that internet is way less than gas and electricty (which are under my name) and it doesn't make sense to send her what I owe for internet when she will just have to send it back plus more for the bills she owes me. She hasnt ever understood this so that day at work I had written down the math showing how much we each owed for each bill and subtracting what I owed her for internet from what she owes me for the rest. Then she says that I am self-destructive bc of my ex (I have struggled with an eating disorder since highschool), but I point out it's been way before my ex and I even met and shes knows this. At this point she screams she's moving out and I am terrible and need to be ""taken down a notch"". This is all a surprise to me since we've been best friends forever. I found out from mutual friends that both T AND B have been claiming I made a spreadsheet of every little thing she owes me (2 dollars for beer, 3 for toilet paper, 5 for food), when this is not the case AT ALL, and was only for utilities.

I didnt talk to her for a couple days and yesterday she came up to me and apologized for being mean for no reason. How do I prevent this in the future? I keep feeling like maybe my body language or something is saying that I'm stuck-up or have a better than you attitude. The thing is, this isn't the first time this happened to me. A couple years ago another roommate of mine screamed at me and called me a barrage of insults for kissing my boyfriend at a party and ""rubbing it in her face"". I don't know why this keeps happening and feel like I'm the common denominator.

TL;DR My roomate got angry at me at a party over vague things and made passice aggressive comments on my appearance. I don't really understand why she is upset",relationship_advice
t3_dlf7h8,How do I(23F) make peace with the fact that I'll be forever alone without worrying other people?,"Up until now, I have never dated/been in a relations/or even been asked out. Before it was because I was too busy with school and being not dirt poor to care, and I just thought that if someone would really like me it would happen. Clearly that didn't work out lol.

Right now, I'm not poor anymore and saved a lot of money. I have a job I like and gym 5 times a week. I solo travel and hike a lot among other things. Basically what I'm saying is that I think I'm in a good place already, but it seems like dating still isn't a thing for me.

I have tried though before. I've asked guys out myself but they all ghosted me and slowly faded out that a first date just never happened. It never really bothered me until recently when I met with my friends, and I noticed that they all, at some point. have dated or seen someone. Even those that said they were aromantic and the ones that didn't actively find anyone.

This just made me really sad and disappointment with myself because like what's wrong with me?? Am I just that unlikeable that I haven't so much as met someone who would give me the time of day? At this point, I've accepted that there are some people who just never find anyone. Sucks, but it's out of my hands.

I understand that my circumstances also make it near impossible to meet anyone. I work from home so obviously I don't meet people and tbh, I don't have the guts to try dating apps because I don't think I'm pretty or interesting enough for them. But it's whatever I guess. What I'm asking is how do I learn to accept my perpetual singleness without coming off as sad or something. I don't actively exude sad and depressed thankfully haha but as I get older, I think I'll just appear lonelier and that would probably just end up worrying my friends and mom.

tl;dr  
Never dated. Tried it, failed. Am almost certain I'll be alone. How do I accept my solitude without appearing sad?",relationship_advice
t3_dlsbxj,How do I (22F) deal with working with a family member?,"I got a job with my mom‚Äôs (52F) company. I also live with my parents and sibling. We are in completely different departments. No overlap in any way. Different floors, different wings of a large building with hundreds of employees, part of a large international company with thousands of employees. There is no reason for us to ever cross paths professionally. 

How can I deal with the following:

1. Mom introduces me as her daughter to her team (a team is 4-6 people on one project) and close coworkers. But it still makes me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt mind that people know of our relationship, but I mind that people only recognize me as Mom‚Äôs daughter. I like to say that we are ‚Äúrelated,‚Äù but not HOW. 

2. She stalked me on our IM today. I was in an exceptionally long meeting and thus my status was listed as ‚Äúaway.‚Äù She called and texted me until I picked up hours later. She claimed to be worried that she didn‚Äôt know where I was. I can‚Äôt not share my status because coworkers need to know. I can‚Äôt block her. 

3. She constantly IMs me to check on my progress. I don‚Äôt owe her progress reports of any kind. Why can‚Äôt we catch up during lunch or when I get home?

4. She gives me unsolicited, useless advice. I can‚Äôt stand that my IM goes off constantly for things that don‚Äôt matter to me. It distracts me. I want to know if someone legit needs me, so I have to keep notifications on. 

5. She is really excited to share that I am working at her company. I want to share my employment status on my own time, but she already shared a Facebook status congratulating me and my super close friend for getting jobs at the same time. My friend was also peeved because she didn‚Äôt tell everyone yet. I told her to take it down. She said she won‚Äôt because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù I mainly don‚Äôt want my friends and family to think that I got this job because of her. I got this job because I‚Äôm smart and qualified. My mom isn‚Äôt important enough to get someone hired in a different department. 

6. I don‚Äôt want to bring my work home with me. I like talking about what a crappy day I had and how I don‚Äôt like a certain coworker, but frustrations about a program or technical things I have to do or work responsibilities are not something I want to talk about. She keeps trying to train me on a system outside of my 40 hrs/week. 

I get that she is excited for me. But how do I force her to stay within my boundaries?? I‚Äôm not going to my first day of kindergarten. I don‚Äôt need someone to hold my hand, and I surely don‚Äôt want her to. I want to stand out on my own as a capable employee and I‚Äôm afraid that her actions will hurt that. 

She‚Äôs historically illogical and entitled (so many story‚Äôs for r/entitledparents and r/raisedbynarcissists). Hate to admit it, but at times she has been emotionally/physically/financially abusive. Loves gaslighting. She is the matriarch of the family - she has final say in everything. We live in America, but we are Eastern European immigrants (I mention this because it highly affects family dynamics). 

I‚Äôm against doing anything that could get her fired or me moving out. I want to be as peaceful as possible. HR seems out of the question.

t3_dlsbsz,Am i really this retarted?,"Well, this whole ordeal could be a novel but ima try n sum it up.  Im in love with my ex gf and cant seem to cut it off as it really needs to be done.  Couple reasons that to me have made sense but once again i havent been interprettting anything correctly for over 3 weeks now.  So...

My ex gf and I of 5 years have had many many problems and hurdles thrown at us.  Always testing out relationship and strenghts and weaknesses.  Sometimes we would split up for a lil sometimes not.  I would always be the one to leave if it happened. Yet, once cooled down given a day or couple months we would always end up back together. ALWAYS.  So hard to fit everything in such short writing here but ya...  This time we been apart 5 mos.  Quite awhile, not our longest but quite awhile. Biggest difference frim the get was she actually threw me out this time.  Now listen, im not the easiest person to get along with but im also not the most difficult.  My loyalty to her in the last 5 years since we even met has never wavered.  I couldnt and wouldnt dare do something to make these temporary fights have a everlasting damage. Unfortunately it wasnt the same felt for her this time.   I found out shes been fkn some dude and more than once assuming more.  The same day i went ans visited her she reitterated she was my gf and loves me was same day i found this all out.  Since then life for me has been shit.  Although we werent living together i had always assumed, and i guess thats my fault, that the damage caused by cheating would be unrepairable.  Sooo... Dang theres just so much to all this but im trying to hit key points for the quick easy read and ultimately some direction.  As if its not obvious right?   Ive swallowed my pride and said i still love you and want us to make it work. The many times i left conversation open in hopes of hearing regret at her decision or to apologize has never come still to today.  And honesrly thats the biggest issue im having.  I mean im seriously willing to forgive and she hasnt even thought of apologizing.  Soooo wtf does that mean?  Obvious right, well not really.  She still till even today says she wants me back if i can do x y z.  And of course saying she loves me all the while..  What a mess.  Pure mess.  I know what to do i was just hoping maybe putting it in type would give some clarity i havent seen yet.  Kinda just enforced everything i was thinking actually.  I know if i was reading this id be like what a fkn chump. Lol.  Crazy truth is im not. Not by far..  Boils down to Love mixed with pain blurs alot. ALoT.  Comment if you choose.. Mind you im guilty of doing things wrong but nothing deserving of whata happened.  Crazy as this sounds it almost seems to be that she is able to belittle cheating to the point in her head that justifies it or makes it ok.  Dumfounded i am.  So i guess i do have a question after all.  How can she justify her behavior as acceptable in her head?  Like i mean she can straight face talk like it isnt nothing wrong she did because this that and the other...   Life is fkn grand isnt it.",relationship_advice

t3_dlj9cr,Tech kid [16M] groped me [16F] and I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"I‚Äôm a girl who puts a lot of time and passion into her theatre department at school. As such, I occasionally pick up roles and enjoy them fully. Recently, our school decided to do a big musical. I auditioned for the part of a certain cutesy animal lead, and I managed to get it. I was very excited. Keep in mind, our school has limited funds and limited microphones as well.

Now, it‚Äôs been a few weeks into rehearsals. Our first show is next week, and my costume finally came in. It‚Äôs rather childish, but a lot of people get a laugh out of me dancing around like a bunny in the costume.

One night during rehearsals, I‚Äôm standing backstage waiting for my chance to do a mic change with one girl on stage. The scene ends, the girl walks off, and she gives me her microphone. From there, I begin to put it on. I have a little trouble though, and one tech kid backstage notices this. Let‚Äôs call him Sam. Sam is a known furry in our theatre community, so I‚Äôm a little hesitant around him. He takes my microphone, and begins to put it on me, before grabbing my butt really tight as he slid the microphone‚Äôs box into my pants. I wanted to scream, but I thought it was an accident, so I remain quiet. From there, he turns me around and begins hiding my microphone‚Äôs wire under my shirt before grabbing my butt again, even tighter this time. It was painful.

Basically we've been together for almost a year, in the same program and at the same universities taking the same courses. Meaning we have the same amount of assignments and tests. 
I'm his first relationship and he's my first serious and longer termed one.


he spends all his time on school work, whether reading his notes the textbooks or practice questions and doing assignments etc and I get that as a student school is important and a main focus but his actions just makes me feel unreasonable for asking him to spend any time with me, and even if he does spend time with me his mind is always on school reviewing concepts and such.


He would only come over at like 11pm when he's done everything and just sleeps, like barely any conversation or simple couply things like sharing how their day went, no kissing or anything beyond that either, literally just to sleep and make me ""happy"" so I'll stop whining that he never spends time with me. 


The thing is, we weren't always like this, for last school year we were much closer, he would come at like 6 or 7 pm and we would cook and eat together then work together too then he'll stay over and we'll go to class together in the morning. And everything was fine, he got good grades and all, I wasn't much of a ""distraction"".


At first I didn't think much of it, but now I'm doubting his intentions last year, we lived way closer then (before 3 mins walk, now, 10 mins walking) and he hated his dorm and hated spending time there due to the conditions (he shared one room with a roomate while I had private room and access to a kitchen and own washroom, while he shared those with his entire floor). So due to these factors, I'm starting to think we only did so much together cause it was convenient and essentially better for him.


But this year since he has his own room and living with close friends we never spend time after school hours, and during school hours it feels like we're forced to be together since we have the same classes but it's not quality time or anything since his roommate tags along in all the classes too. So we never get any ""couple time"" alone whatsoever. 


I get that school is important to him, it's important for all of us, but the fact he can just push me to the side and only do enough to satisfy the minimum makes me feel so dependent and needy. And makes me question whether if I'm just being too sensitive and this is how it is, like how true adult relationships work, since this is my first serious and long term one. I don't know how much to expect from him and wasn't sure if I was just too hopeless romantic living in this perfect fantasy world I created in my mind that he, as a human cannot uphold to.

Another factor is that I'm dumber than he is, so I'll always ask him to clarify or explain questions to me, while his roommates are smarter than he is, so he goes to them for answers, which is also why I think he spends so much time with them. But this is just a side thing that makes me feel useless. I try not to ask him school related questions anymore so he doesn't get annoyed at me.


So idk if I'm being unreasonable and should suck it up since we all have our individual lifes or that I should just give up and leave this relationship 



I've talked to him about this issue before and while he acknowledged and understands where I'm coming from, things haven't really changed. 
When I'm with him, he seems genuine and actually wants to be with me, it's just he's not with me much. 


P. S. He's also never said ""I love you"" to me before which idk if that's a bad sign or it means he's serious about those words since I'm his first relationship.",relationship_advice
t3_dls6ns,How do I (20F) repair a relationship with my ex-best friend (20M) after his girlfriend (18F) sabotaged it?,"I'm 20F, ex-best friend is 20M, who I'll call John. John and I met our freshman year of college and hit it off right away. We became really close friends with no underlying romantic interests, as I've been out as a lesbian since I was 17. We hit it off so well that we decided to be roommates our sophomore year.

The first few months of our roommate relationship were great, and we very compatible lifestyle-wise. We never had any arguments about having guests over, drinking/smoking, cleanliness, or scheduling. If we had any issues we addressed them respectfully and at the time they arose.

Then John started seeing ""Melody"" (18F). I liked her at first, but their relationship quickly became intense. She said that she loved him within a month. As a freshman, she had no friends, and did not make any outside of John--he became her entire life. As a result, I was starting to feel abandoned by my friend. I thought a good way to remedy this was to become friends with Melody.

I started to learn some questionable things about their relationship through trying to get to know her. First, I could not hold a conversation with her. She would only talk about herself and would interrupt me in the middle of my sentences. She only talked about John, and told me that she had his entire schedule on Google Calendar and his whereabouts tracked on Find My Friends. She found this romantic and organized. She also told me that she would melt down if she didn't hear from him in twenty minutes or more. Finally, she told me GRAPHIC details of their sex life.

I asked around to others who knew Melody what she was like, as this raised alarm bells for me having been in abusive relationships before. They told me that she'd tried to date seven people in the month before she met John in her time at college, and he just happened to stick. She was an emotionally manipulative friend to a girl I'll call Kay, who also told me more about Melody. Apparently, Melody showed Kay some explicit pictures she'd taken of John. Other times, she would wake Kay up at 3am and knock on her door if she needed something. To say the least, she was an emotional leech, so Kay cut her off.

I tried to address some of my concerns with John coming from a place of compassion, explaining that some of Melody's behavior was worrisome. He told me it was none of my business and he could handle it himself, so I backed off. And then things with Melody went to shit. Either John or another friend must have told her what I'd said, so she told John not to spend time with me anymore and she spread rumors around the school about me. Fortunately her reputation and my better one among our classmates stopped them pretty quickly and people came to me to confirm that they were untrue. I was enraged and tried to address it with John, who called me childish and then played Dr. Phil and tried to get me to talk it out with Melody, who wanted to clear out the bad blood and resolve the situation. I told her I'd be civil, but I would not be friends.

My friendship with John was effectively over after that. We remained roommates but every time we hung out, he would spend all of his time on his phone texting Melody, who would conveniently have a ""crisis"" whenever he wanted to spend time with me. I gave up on him and put my energy into hanging out with other friends.

On the last day of the school year, I asked John if I could throw a small goodbye party in our room from 8pm-12pm. I was going to make some cocktails for my friends, and he was welcome to come if he wanted. He wanted the room to fuck Melody one last time before break, so we amended it from 8-11pm, and we agreed that this was a solid compromise. At 11:02, my friends had not yet left, so he busted down the door and started being a dick to everyone. I yelled at him that how dare he make my friends uncomfortable and feel unwelcome, and he needed to handle the situation more politely. I admit that it was wrong of me to raise my voice and get angry, but it was a culmination of frustration I should have dealt with earlier.

We talked the next day and John was minimally apologetic. I told him I needed space. I was going away the next semester on study abroad so we could talk when I got back. I went to New Zealand, am still here now, and started dating an amazing woman and made some great friends here. John reached out and sent me a very sweet and sincere apology for his behavior over Instagram two months ago, and he says he's thinking of ways to be a better friend to me when I get back. I want to be friends with him again so badly, but he's still dating Melody.

When I go home, is it worth it to be friends with him again? How do we even begin to repair our relationship?

TL;DR best friend's girlfriend sabotaged our relationship and we stopped talking, now he wants to be friends again but he's still dating her.

He seems to be getting progressively more selfish and inconsiderate every month. A good example of this is from last Sunday:

I work a full-time job with overtime almost daily as well as a part-time job. Right now I'm clearing 80 hours+ a week. 

We watched some movies and when 7pm (I wake up at 4AM for work) rolled around I could barely keep my eyes open. I told him that I wanted to sleep and he flipped out yelling about me only ever working or sleeping anymore. It's important to note that I'm working so much because our dog is having some serious medical issues that cost me 150 a week and i am the only one paying for OUR dog. 

I reminded him that when he was working a bunch, he would go to bed around 6 or 7 and I never complained. We have two other rooms that he can go watch movies in just like I've done. He then yells at me to go in one of the other rooms to sleep while he lays in my bed to watch movies since it's his house  (I pay 1/2 the rent).  This is after working both jobs that day, doing laundry, cleaning up a bit of his mess and cooking dinner. 

I don't ever know if it's possible to talk to him anymore or if it's even worth it. This man has never had a relationship last longer than a year besides his current one with me and I'm starting to understand why. I'm so exhausted from work and just life in general that I'm not sure trying to work things out is even worth the effort.

t3_dls3dx,"I (an 18F), got told by two men to ""smile"" and it's making me uncomfortable","TLDR;

I'm an 18F and have recently started working in my local supermarket. Being an introvert with a resting bitch face, I can tend to look kinda sad when in reality I'm actually happy or just daydreaming. I also look like I'm about 15, so I'm thinking maybe people tend to take advantage of that. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a serious person. I love having fun. I do smile, I'm quite goofy and I like to laugh (sometimes at pretty dumb things that no one else finds funny).

A few days ago, a colleague of mine (who I know pretty well, and is a genuinely kind guy) told me to ""Smile!"". Loudly. Impulsively, I flashed a fake smile, but deep down I felt humiliated and surprised since, a few minutes before he said that, I was genuinely smiling. But now, the smile felt fake and I felt as if I was performing rather than expressing emotion.

Just recently, it happened again. A stranger happened to be at the self-service checkouts where I was keeping watch and told me before he left - ""Hi. Would you like some advice? Smile more!"" And so I forced a smile, mumbled something and then he quickly left. To be honest, being told to smile more made me detest the thought of doing it because I don't like expressing fake emotions, just for the sake of doing it. 

Maybe they just have good intentions. Maybe they think I'm sad and want to cheer me up? Though I'd much prefer if they went up to me and asked if I was okay instead of demanding me to look a certain way. That would probably result in a natural smile.

It's just that I feel objectified and I'm wondering if you guys have ever experienced anything like this? I hope I'm not being overdramatic or sensitive, but I just needed to get this off my chest.

Me and my partner have been together now for 5 Years I‚Äôm a 23M and she‚Äôs 23F. We met at university, we both decided to take breaks from our studies and move to another country. 

Now our relationship is toxic, we‚Äôre both not in love with eachother as we once were. Communication issues, trust issues, every issue you name it. 

So, I‚Äôd like us to break up (I think it‚Äôs mutual) but we‚Äôre both in bad financial situation. I know the obvious answer of ending the relationship no matter what if we‚Äôre not in love but hear me out and then let me know what you‚Äôs think.

t3_dllmp9,S/O wants to move...but I'm not sure. Really need advice.,"First time post. Not even a lurker. Just need advice pretty badly right now and hopefully I came to the right place. Here's the situation:

Met girlfriend in college, freshly engaged (after 6+ years of dating). She goes to grad school where I live, grew up, and work--NJ. When she graduates/our lease ends in a year and a half, she wants to move somewhere else. Here are her reasons:

\-I have a lot of family and friends in the area, and we're currently about 20 minutes from my hometown. She feels like she wants to get a fresh start with me, since she feels like she's just ""fitting into my life"" here. 

\-She doesn't like NJ. There are no real good reasons here IMO, mostly just excuses I think that support the first point.

\-Her family is kind if strewn all over (SC, Chicago, CT), so she has no real ties to anywhere.

\-She feels we are young (26/27) and now is the time to explore and set roots somewhere on our own terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it's extra tough for me. My family really wants me to stay close. My family has always been loyal and incredibly supportive my whole life. My Dad has expressed that he wouldn't support me moving away because he feels like there's no valid reason to do so. They've really been perfect, and have given me as much or as little space as I've needed in my transition to adulthood, and have really embraced my fiance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I feel:

\-I don't love the idea of leaving just for a ""fresh start"" when I have a good job, friends, and family here. It's like leaving a situation where I'm completely comfortable and happy for somewhere that hopefully I can do the same thing. 

\-I like being close to my family, it makes me feel supported. Do I need to venture off a little bit to let my relationship grow independently of my parent's involvement? Maybe. But at what cost?

\-I have friends who are rooted here with family businesses, etc. Friends I've had my whole life. Am I someone who just can't leave their hometown area? Right now I'm not IN my hometown, but I can see where my fiance is coming from with just being *Hawaiian Brunch's Fiance* all the time and not establishing her own identity.

\-I have a successful career here, and I'd have to find a job elsewhere with as much potential, which isn't easy. My fiance has said that obviously we wouldn't sacrifice that if we couldn't find something promising for me elsewhere, which makes sense. But I still would be giving up what I have, which is unfortunate.

\-If/when we have kids, I'd really like to be close to my family because I feel like it's important and beneficial. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, leaving this area would help us establish ourselves, but would come at a much higher cost for me than my fiance. My family would feel like I'm leaving them for not a good reason, and I fear would resent my fiance and maybe even me for leaving. Super stressed out about this. Any advice would be so great.",relationship_advice
t3_dlozdt,"Scared of either breaking up or staying, leaving me (20F) and boyfriend (25M) in uncertainty for 2 months","Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years. I was 16 and struggled a lot with depression, an unstable home and a lack of friends before I met him. Just starting to pick everything up again, and there he was: a very stable guy. We have this very peaceful relationship with a lot of love, but I agreed to some of his flaws at 16 which i am struggling with at 20. For example, he is not very outgoing or affectionate and I struggle with him in company of friends. Thats just who he is, and I don‚Äôt desire to change him to my likings, as that feels unfair and i don‚Äôt want him to feel as if he‚Äôs ‚Äònot good enough‚Äô.  

Also, when I was a younger I imagined my life when I was 20 and studying way different than it is, as we live together in a house he bought for the two of us. I really longed for this stability, but now I have it, I‚Äôm not so sure I want it anymore. I thought I would be partying and sleeping around at this age. I wish life could just spice up a little bit, but he struggles with finding hobbies and filing his spare time. We tried to do that together, but it was never successful. He should find those things for himself, i cant do that for him.  But I do love him very much. I love taking care of him, I love cuddling with him, and all those things. But we can‚Äôt really talk for hours and we never could, and I‚Äôm starting to realize the importance in those ‚Äòlittle‚Äô things. 

That realization started two months ago, making me awfully sad. The thought of leaving everything behind and starting without him terrifies me. I‚Äôve talked to him about this, and he takes it so well. So well, that I‚Äôm worried he would lose himself in supporting me. He told me to take my time when I doubted him and damn, thats the strongest thing I‚Äôve ever seen anyone do. I admire him for only wanting the best thing for me and that is one of the things I love about him. I know that if I stay, our future together will be bright. He supports all my dreams and we are in a good place financially. Also, I‚Äôm not sure how ‚Äòperfect‚Äô somebody can be. Will there ever be someone who I match with better? I know you can never have it all, but am I giving too much, and taking too little? 
I have this huge fear of missing out on a life that I cant have because I have made this commitment to him. But I do love him, a lot. He is great and the feeling we share is very strong. 
Will someone ever love me so supportively as he does? 

Im scared to leave, because I will leave our happy, stable home for an unstable/uncertain future, and make him and myself terribly sad and lose someone who loves and supports me.
Im scared to stay, because I‚Äôm not sure he full fills my needs in the long run and I will miss out on weird, wild situations. 

Right now, Im sleeping at my dad‚Äôs house. Because I realized I cant think clearly about him when I am living with him. He supported that idea, but has given me an ultimatum: this Friday I have to make a decision. I understand that fully, but I‚Äôm now struggling a lot, emotionally.

We have cuddled and kissed only a couple  times. I'm not a very vocal person when it comes to affection, I can't say ""I love you"" to someone even if I do love them. Like my parents for example.

He hasn't met my parents, but I've told my family that I'm dating him. The usual questions come about. He doesn't have a job due to a medical condition, doesn't have a car or learners or anything like that. We planned for him to come to my house (I live with my parents as does he) but he was a no show. He told me he had a doctors appointment and he didn't have any data so he couldn't text me. I say OK. We then plan a hang out at my place again for the week after. 

That day rolls around and we're texting about it. I was at school waiting to be picked up from my mother (I have my learners). We buy some groceries for dinner and last minute I ask her if my boyfriend can come over, she doesn't say anything but looks annoyed since at that time his mother was sick so he asked if I could pick and drop him off. My mother doesn't like her car as she's been meaning to fix the hood lining that is coming off and her TV show she likes to watch would be on soon. 

I admit I should have asked permission instead of springing it on her last minute. But he didn't end up coming because he was having an argument with his older sister about centrelink and him letting his mother and older sister do everything for him. His doctor appointments, his headspace appointments (he's depressed), not getting a job etc. His sister messages me to try to convince him to finish a claim for centrelink. She told me he could get a job but doesn't even try to look for one. 

I was stunned at that because he told me he couldn't drive or work because of his medical condition. I guess he thought saying the truth would make him look bad to me. I haven't talked to him about it. 

He became very upset, blocking his sister on social media (he can only message on there because his phone is broken) and I became the middle person of the argument saying stuff for his sister to him and back again. Apparently he said some stuff to his sister that was hurtful and he knew would hurt her. 

He didn't reply to my last text so I left it, he didn't respond or read my message until a couple days later. He apologised for not replying, he set up his claim and will be doing an appointment to prove he has the medical condition so he can claim for disability. 

We get to talking and we catch up in what's been happening. We ask when to catch up at my place again, I said maybe this weekend but that I would ask my parents first. I haven't asked them yet. 

At dinner, my dad asks what the deal is with my boyfriend saying ""he's coming over then he doesn't then he's coming over to not come over again."" I say I don't know. Then my mum and my dad say I should probably break up with him since he doesn't have a job or a car and that I should get with someone who does and who is reliable. (I don't have a job but am at school and am going to higher education after) 

So, now I'm not sure what to do. Should I ask my parents for my boyfriend to come over or not? Should I break up with him? I'm confused and feel stressed just thinking about it since I also am busy with assignments since I'm graduating in a few weeks and I need to plan for prom.",relationship_advice
t3_dls117,Changing toxic behaviour and trying to get back together in the future?,"I was in a relationship with a girl I loved. I had shitty attitudes and didn't understand her position quite well. I'm in a process of changing my behaviours, understanding my feelings better and how/if to express them. Some of these attitudes weren't really toxic but more like counter-productive to her well being, which I regret not understanding. Does it sound crazy to try to fix my shit and later on, if I still have feelings for her, to try and get back together?

We ended up in a no-contact state and she doesn't want to be with me or in a relationship with anyone as of now. I fucked up, not badly but still. I'm changing for myself and not just to win her back, but being that I still feel for her I'd like for both of us to try again if we ever encounter paths.

t3_dlrzyd,Husband's 'pet name' for female co worker or am I overreacting?,"How would you feel about your husband (32M) calling a female (27f) co worker 'pussycat' in sms'. 

There's a whole other back ground of crap that I may post eventually that could link in with this but it's long and atm I'm just trying to workout if I'm being silly about this or not.

*Edit for full story-might be long, sorry!!*

About 2 yrs ago hubby and I were going through a lot of issues with his mother. She's always given me grief and he has always stood up for me. His mother has not seen our children in years because of her actions and it had started to wear away at home. He desperately wanted to fix the rift between so he could take our kids to the home where he grew up, have a relationship with their grandparents etc. We ended up having a big fight where I basically said I didn't think we could work through this anymore and maybe divorce was our only option.

This set a series of events into place.

A few months later for fuck knows what reason, I picked up his phone and looked through his messages. In 11 years together I'd never done that ever. Don't ask what made me do it. In his phone were lots of messages with different people at work. He was messaging a woman we will call 'May'. 99% of their messages were work with nothing dodgy but there were two messages a bit flirty for my liking. She never replied in a flirty manner and in fact ignored the ones that seemed flirty. I said nothing but decided to keep an eye out.

A few weeks later he had SMSd her asking to go gym together if she wanted. He goes really early in the morning and for work she is up early too. I wouldn't care of he wanted to train with another woman as long as he told me. I managed to ask him if he had found any gym buddies to train with (as he had said he'd been wanting one) and he said no. I asked him if he asked this person/that person and he said yes he had but nothing had come of it. I asked if he'd asked May (I knew they were work colleagues) and he flat out said no. He did not. I felt sick to my stomach.

Eventually I rechecked his phone and he'd deleted it. I ended up fessing up to checking his phone and he said he'd asked her but then felt ashamed because it wasnt right so deleted. He said he'd been trying to make more friends (he's generally been a loner) since I'd said we should consider divorcing and he looked at May as a good friend he wanted to make more effort with. He admitted to lying to my face and said he'd felt ashamed of himself for having asked her. 

What followed was 2 yrs of me trying to heal from this. He has to talk to her for work purposes but has offered to completely cut off contact with her if I wanted. I said no as it would be weird as they work together.

Then I decided to check his phone today (clearly I've got my own issues here that I need to sort through) and found the SMS calling her 'pussycat'.

I should note he hardly ever goes out without me, has no password I dont know, still very much intimate with me and none of the classic cheating trademarks. What should I do??

TL;dr- husband a bit flirty with co worker, I'm not sure what else is going on.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmxj5,Advice wanted about Moving on from divorce after 5 years. (I‚Äôm a dude),"TL;DR: what‚Äôs the best way to move on, and get back to normal life after a 5 year marriage/divorce? 

I (M 28) am expecting my probable ex wife (F 36) to send the confirmed divorce papers soon after a lengthy REAL ‚Äúirreconcilable differences‚Äù conversation.

We‚Äôve been officially divorced for roughly a year, my post history has me posting here and AITA to get general advice and I‚Äôve been doing my best to salvage anything I could, to no avail- we are at a complete stalemate because I‚Äôm not willing to risk another 5 years of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs live beyond our means and keep up with the lifestyle we want, and eventually it‚Äôll fall into place‚Äù

After $30,000 in medical bills, and credit cards to pay for food, I‚Äôm living on my mother and father‚Äôs couch, in massive debt, and starting a business so I can have a decent, normal life.
I won‚Äôt be living in Santa Monica anytime soon, but visiting is possible.

After living here for a year, before going back to my family, signing divorce papers so she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have to worry about me‚Äù I‚Äôve started a business, it‚Äôs slow growing as all are, and it‚Äôs not in her degree of acceptance.

I got to see her for 2 days a month or so ago, and it was all I could do not to get into an argument, I would say one little thing about how I liked where I am (it‚Äôs Kentucky, it‚Äôs calm, and it‚Äôs not a meat grinder like Los Angeles and New York were, I‚Äôve been to both and spent 3 years in Los angles. It was painful.)

To get personal, we had sex and I couldn‚Äôt finish because I wasn‚Äôt generally attracted to her, she had spent the past year telling me she was happier away from me, losing weight, and overall felt better. While I was visiting her, I walked on eggshells in conversation, and she had gained weight (I wasn‚Äôt expecting a major change, but she gained 20 or so lbs while telling me she lost 30), was hung over from the night before and made fun of me and the people I am living with currently.

I just couldn‚Äôt get the thought of ‚ÄúI get 10 days a year with my wife, who hates my ‚Äúheritage‚Äù and isn‚Äôt willing to live anywhere near me. This isn‚Äôt a marriage.‚Äù

I lied to myself obviously- and have been living a single guys life for the most part of a year, minus that 2 days. 

If I get the paperwork, she‚Äôs never talking to me again (which is close to the last year as it is) and I have to tell my family that I‚Äôm divorced- and hide that I‚Äôve been divorced for a year since I‚Äôve been trying to salvage this marriage, a lost cause.

‚Äî
Any advice for getting through this as well as possible?
The normal reaction in my family to this type of thing is getting drunk ASAP, and within the next few weeks have a woman to make the ex jealous.

I don‚Äôt want to make her jealous, I just want the same thing I‚Äôve wanted for the past year- someone I can talk to that isn‚Äôt going to berate me and understands that I‚Äôm not a miracle worker, a friend who doesn‚Äôt make me feel like they hate me after I spend time with them.",relationship_advice
t3_dllj6r,My boyfriend (34M) is being accused of rape by his ex girlfriend(30F?)," Let's call them A (boyfriend 34M) and B (his ex 30F?). This is the story he told me:

Apparently this happened in 2014, they had been dating for 2 years at this point. They were both in the army at the time. B had asked A several times to have sex with her at work. He had declined because they could get into serious trouble if they were caught. One day, while at work they got in a fight. B was upset, saying that A didn't love her, and that he didn't find her attractive, and she didn't know why they were together. A tried to persuade her that this wasn't true. He suggested that they have sex (in an attempt to make things better). She declined. The argument continued, and they ended up having sex. There was no physical force, and B never told him to stop, but I don't know if she ever verbally consented to sex after declining. Several weeks later B tells A that he raped her. He's confused, and when asked she brings up that night. A is apologetic and says that he had no idea. They continue to date for a year after that.

In 2015 they have a messy breakup. In 2018 B goes to the military police and tells them that she was raped while on duty. They military police are now deciding whether to press charges. If they decide to charge A, there will be a military trial. I don't really know how the military justice system works.

I'm really struggling with how to deal with this. A and I (33F) have been dating for over 3 years. We live together, we're planning to get married. If he winds up going to prison for this, I just don't know what I'm going to do. I'm just hoping that they drop the case and don't end up pursuing it. I want to believe his version of the story.

Edit to add more context: my current partner talks a lot to my ex over Facebook and texting. I'm not 100 percent sure of what they talk about as I am very respectful of my partners privacy. I do know that when they hang out there is typically drinking and going out to clubs, and the guy my ex cheated on me with is usually there, but not always. We live in a small town of about 9000 people so most people know each other, and we're all the same age (26). As for the reason they all started chatting and hanging out, I really couldn't say. My partner most likely just wanted to make more friends, which usually I'm more than fine with.

t3_dllfy3,One sided marriage,"So I have been married to this guy for 7 years and with him for 15 years. We have two kids an 11 year old and a 7 year old. There have been multiple rifts in our marriage caused by his actions and both sides of inlaws even physical altercations between me and his sisters. As our relationship has progressed we have had our own abusive behaviors physical and verbal. I have recently been taking an objective view of my marriage and have observed him mentally and sometimes emotionally abusing me. He will do or say things and then lie about it or tell me I'm lying or crazy. I have called him out repeatedly and with no resolve. He just denies everything and flips the script. I have since emotionally and sexually detached myself from our marriage because I sense that I have fallen out of love with him. He constantly calls off of work and then complains his check is short and then asks me for money. On the flip side, I rarely call off work while even dealing with a very painful health issue that is never going to go away. I clean and wash on my off days but rarely does he make time for me. He has a property that was given to him that I financially helped rehab that he pockets all the money from. Then now we are in the process of renting our house out only to move into an apartment. I feel that he is going to do the same with this situation. I honestly feel like he is using me financially to help him with these properties only to act like it's just his money to pocket as use how he wishes.

Since yesterday however, she's become super distant, saying that she isn't up for the role (She didn't explain what she meant by this). For context, we met 2 days ago on a Monday. We went for a swim and chilled at my place. Everything was fine and we're both happy with each other's company. All up till when I had to send her home, I could sense that something was off. I talked to her and tried to find out what was wrong but she brushed it off and said everything was okay. Fastfoward it to yesterday morning, she mentioned that she doesn't trust me when I tell her that my family members like her and that she feels that I'm saying such things without any basis. I replied saying that we both have a role to play in getting my parents to like her and that we should both work harder. She replies me with a ""I don't care about everything anymore"". After that she proceeds to ghost me up till today when I told her I'm cancelling the party that we planned together. My reason was that I can't pretend to be happy infront of my friends while this is happening. She proceeded to say things like ""Do the party or I won't talk"", ""Don't let what's happening between us affect other people"" and ""I won't ruin your 21st celebration, don't worry"". I replied saying I wasn't going to do the party, which led her to give me an ultimatum - Do the party, or she wouldn't discuss anything more with me.

About a week ago I got an email from a girl in one of my classes. She said I was 'cute'. I like her too, and I didn't know how to respond. I responded basically saying 'you're cute too' and she gave me her number. I have never been in a relationship with someone before, so this was my first time being 'with' someone. I texted her and she asked if I wanted to hang out. I said sure, and I went over to her housing building about 2 days later. We both did some art together, because that was the class we both shared and we talked. She's really nice and a great person. After a while, she said we could watch something on Hulu, so we watched some AHS. Eventually, we fell asleep next to each other in her bed, with her occasionally putting her arm on me. Nothing else happened. In the morning I woke up and she went to work while I packed up and left her room a little bit after her. 

It was nice to hang out, and I feel like we were somewhat connected. A little bit after she texts me saying 'you're cute sorry if I'm awkward' so I respond saying 'you're good, i had a good time, and sorry if I was awkward'. 

However, after a while, I started to realize that I may not be ready to handle a relationship. It has nothing to do with her, because she's wonderful. I just think that I still need to work on some stuff before I can start dating. I should have expressed these feelings to her beforehand, but in the moment, it seemed fine to me. I'm planning on telling her this tomorrow after class. I have a rough 'script' on how to ask her if we can just stay as friends, but I also really don't want to hurt her feelings. She doesn't deserve any pain. 

This is my rough script, if it helps:

&amp;#x200B;

""I hate bringing this up now because I don't want to make you sad, but I need to say it: I haven't been in a relationship before and I'm not sure I'm ready for one. Is it okay if we stay just as friends? This is something I need to work on and there's nothing wrong with you. I should have said something earlier but I really didn't want to upset you. You're amazing and I don't know if I'm ready to handle this. I really really really don't want you to think you're the reason for this. You're great and don't need to change who you are.

He is also going to school to become a programmer, and won‚Äôt need to work at random places in the mall anymore, which I thought would help alleviate some of his depression or anxiety. Instead, he told me that everyone tells him it will be okay eventually, but that he needs help in the immediate term. The problem is, I tried to ask what that might look like, and he couldn‚Äôt really give me an answer. He said he gets stressed out from any social interaction now, including from me, so I offered for us to keep conversation light and we don‚Äôt need to discuss anything he doesn‚Äôt want to for the time being. I suggested that we take a couple days break from each other (not maliciously! I do not want to divorce him or anything.); I could hang out in our bedroom and him in our living room, or I could stay with my parents for a couple nights. That was also a no-go. He‚Äôs started to say things like it would be easier if he died, and that he can‚Äôt do anything at all and all he wants to do is crawl into a corner and cease existing. 

I‚Äôm just trying so hard to figure out what would help him, but he‚Äôs having a hard time communicating (understandably). But I can‚Äôt read his mind as to what he would want. Has anyone had a severely depressed spouse, and what were the things you did that helped them the most? I too have anxiety and depression, so I do understand some of what he is feeling. But we handle ours in very different ways.

EDIT to give you a good idea of how bad his anxiety is, he would 100% be a shut in, happy to only see me and perhaps his dad and best friend, for the rest of time. He basically has horrible agoraphobia as well as horrible social anxiety.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmrvq,Big problem,"So I started snapchatting to my crush like 1 week ago, and we are going to a date later this week. She seems like she is into me and so on, but she won't start conversation with me, I'm only starting them and they last many hours almost everyday. I don't know why is that...

t3_dlrugj,My dad (In his 50s) is acting strangely &amp; angering easily and I (15M) have a gut feeling that something is wrong.,"Hey there! Sorry that this is so long! My dad is in his 50s and I am 15. I'd like to think I have a high emotional intelligence, and that I have accurate gut feelings (at least I like to think so), and I would give specific examples but all of the examples focus on friends who have Reddit... Anyways, in the past I would always doubt them until it is later revealed I was right or almost right that something was wrong. General examples: Identifying toxic relationships and people, knowing when people are lying, telling the truth, or hiding something. Of course I'm not always right, and sometimes there was something else going on that I didn't notice that made me think something else. 

Anyways, onto what is going on. He keeping makes 'jokes' that you could barely tell are jokes. For example, we were watching Savage Builds and we got to the third episode (I think) where they were making a post apocalyptic vehicle based on Mad Max. He brought on Simone Giertz and some other woman who I cannot, for the life of me, remember her name. My brother paused it to get something and my dad said something along the lines of ""Oh he shouldn't bring on women! They can't do science!"" And his tone of voice said nothing about it being a joke. I had to ask him and he assured me it was. He has made so many other distasteful jokes recently- when we were planning on watching black panther with him (He hadn't seen it yet, me and my younger brother have) His first reaction was ""Oh not the movie with all the black people!"" He claimed it was sarcasm, but once again nothing in his voice denoted it. He keeps saying ""It's just a joke, don't worry."" and stuff like that. 

He keeps stating things that I don't know how to describe, but they are questionable at best. For example, one of my best friend's dad is absent most of the time, up in silicone valley. He keeps making comments about how he'd date her and that she's basically single. And he claims it's a joke, but he asked for me to ask my friend for her number the other day. He also likes to call anyone who is a democrat insane. Although, that is much more tame compared to the last thing. He used to encourage discourse and intelligent debates, but it's been months since the last one.

He also keeps trying to get me to watch comedy specials. I like comedy. He likes comedy. My brother likes comedy. But I don't like the ones he chooses. I am a bisexual trans guy, and I've had a couple incidents that included slurs. And a lot of the stuff he picks out includes slurs, super homophobic or transphobic stuff. My metal health isn't the best, and comedy is a form of distraction. I'd rather not be reminded of the time some guys tried to push me down a crowded stairwell, or my toxic ex-friends. I've explained this to him, and he stills insists on putting on shows that include things I'd rather not think about. This is not me saying ""Oh all comedians have to be super politically correct all day everyday"" this is me wanting to be distracted from my problems, not reminded of them.

Another thing is he's super angry. More so than usual. He's been yelling and raising his voice much more often. Before it was hard to get him upset, and if he was you really screwed up. And he's yelling for weird reasons too. Like my brother refusing to wear a headband or cut his hair, which keeps getting into his eyes and affecting performance in soccer, or my brother running out of time to find the correct team colors for practice and throwing on some old shorts and socks that barely fit. (After this one, he yelled at my brother so much he began to cry and I ended up having to de-escalate and calm both of them down to tell him that he needs to control his anger, especially if it's a regular occurrence for my and my brother to break down into tears (or get panic attacks in my case) from him yelling at us for simple, easily solved reasons. This has only sated happening in the past year. I don't think it ever happened before then. He said he would, and for a while he did! But it started back up again, and worse than before. We have a rule where we can't use our phones during a show or movie. Unless it's an emergency. One of my friends has been struggling for a long time with their mental health, and they were in a really really bad place, and just got the privilege of being home alone again a week prior. They were home alone and no one was answering, but I did. I had to calm them down and distract them while I tried to contact a friend who lived nearby, and their brother and parents. My dad saw I was on my phone as he started the show, I briefly explained the situation and he said that was okay. Once he decided I had been on too long he took my phone away and I didn't get it back until the the morning. 

Another thing he gets mad about, my grandmother's memory isn't the best anymore. She's a democrat, and my dad is republican. She will watch the news and only remember bits and pieces that don't make sense on their own, but after asking a couple questions you can figure out what she was saying. For example, the crane that collapsed during the construction of that hotel in New Orleans a little while ago. She said that they blew up a building for no reason and killed a ton of people in New Orleans. Me and my grandpa were around when she said this and tried to figure out what she was talking about, and then corrected her and explained what really happened. Once she said that Trump was flying down to that island with Jeffrey Epstein and Clinton. I was on the couch trying to find a show to watch &amp; set up while this was happening. My dad raised his voice and eventually was yelling at my grandmother and saying some very... crude... things about it that I'd rather not repeat. There's so many many times a situation like this occurred but this one is the most recent and extreme. My brother has started making fun of my grandmother too, and for the same reasons. I worry my dad is not being the best influence for that kind of thing. She made a full recovery from kidney failure and her medications cause her to hallucinate which adds more fuel to the fire. 

He just keeps getting worse and worse, and my brother is starting to act like him. It's subtle, but it's definitely happening more and more. I tried to confront him and ask if something was wrong or bothering him because normally if people are this angry without an obvious cause it's from stress or something else going on, which there definitely is (My whole family has a plethora of medical problems and we are struggling to make ends meet financially. There's more, of course, but those are the main ones.) He assured me nothing was wrong. A few weeks later, when I asked him after a particularly distasteful 'joke,' he brushed it off and followed it with another 'joke' and changed the subject. 

I don't know what's going on, but I'm really worried. How do I confront him and make sure he doesn't deflect it. I need to know what's going on. I have a feeling he may of joined the alt right or is becoming more extreme, it makes sense but I don't know. Any ideas on what might be causing this? Or how to fix it?",relationship_advice
t3_dlrtfu,How do I get my girlfriend (f23) to tell the truth of if she is cheating on me (m21)?,"I have been dating my girlfriend for a year and several months. There have been ups and downs like any relationship, but ultimately I love the woman that I am dating. In one of my first romances I was cheated on and subsequently became afraid that it would happen again.

Sadly, I have the suspicion that once again I am being cheated on. Three times now she has defended cheating or brought up incidents in group therapy when someone told another person to forgive themself for being unfaithful to their partner. This initiated my suspicions about her infidelity which tonight was worsened when I saw that she has a box of new, empty condoms in her room. 

All of this has made me very troubled and I know that I want to find out the truth even if it is horrible. What is your advice for me as to how to finding out the truth? 

Also I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs help and advice in advance. This has been difficult for me for obvious reasons and you all have made this better for me, thank you.

t3_dlrsql,NEED Advice!!!!!!!!!!! About a Letter.,"So I just met a girl about 4 weeks ago! We connected really really well. On our first date I gave her a flower which she found to be very sweet of me and the night went amazing. We have been messaging nonestop and she truly likes me and I truly like her. We are still in the phase of getting to know each other and I'm seeing her very soon and I was think to give her a fake flower..being it won't die and give her a letter. In this letter I make reference to a song she really likes to the night we met and also included a poem. It's only one page and towards the end I told her to be the light within herself. So, ladies should I wait or give her the letter when we meet? I don't want to freak her out being that she is an introvert. I want to do it like the old days but it's not a love letter. It just describes our first night we met that's all. What do you guys think? Should I give her the letter? Just really really nervous because I truly don't want her to freak out.

t3_dlrs14,"My partner says yes to an open relationship but says she would be less attracted to me, I need some advice.","Me (18m) and my partner(18f) have an amazing relationship and have been together for about a year in total but we've kinda been stuck in a loop over one issue. My partner has a very low sex drive due to medication she takes and other things. She generally just doesnt want to have sex, period. It really isn't that big of an issue though. Throughout our entire relationship we've had sex twice. We talk a lot and she always would be okay if I had a ""no strings attached"" relationship with other people as long as I dont fall in love with them. We talked about this for a while and always told me this every time. About a month ago I was talking to a friend and she told me that  I should totally do it, so we talked about it for a while. My partner later came downstairs and started chatting with us and asked what we were talking about so I jokingly said, ""we are trying to find me a fuck buddy"" (we joke about things like this all the time). After a bit I left to run errands and my partner asked my friend if I was actually being serious and that if I did actually do that she would be less attracted to me. 

Since then she continues to tell me the same thing, that she's okay with me having sexual relationships with but she'll be less attracted to me. I'm not sure what to do or what to think. I'm on new medication which increases my sex drive, so it's a bit rough for me. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice

t3_dlrqk8,My girlfriend (21f) and I (21m) are in a particularly nasty fight towards the end of our first vacation.,"My girlfriend and I have been together 3 years as of tomorrow. Her family never really traveled out of the state we live in (Colorado), so she‚Äôs never seen a beach but always wanted to go. I figured it would be nice of me to take her to Pensacola beach in Florida, and get us a nice hotel room for about a week. We went to a BBQ place for dinner tonight, and she lost her mind on the way back to the hotel because I bought a $6 toy pig that makes an awful noise. I bout it to be funny, and she didn‚Äôt take it that way at all. For some backstory we don‚Äôt have a lot of money, and this trip took a long time for me to save up for. She only put $500 toward the whole trip but I don‚Äôt really mind seeing as I make a little more than she does. She started going off on me about how it was a waste of $6 because I wouldn‚Äôt return it after getting into the car and already driving halfway to the hotel. She then informed me that I could‚Äôve spent that money on cat or dog food, groceries, gas, rent, etc. after we get back home. To paraphrase, I told her that it was only $6 and they had a sign that said no refunds at the counter. So we‚Äôre stuck with it and if it‚Äôs a big deal I will throw it away. Cue the ‚Äúwhat a waste of money‚Äù comments. Fast forwarding through the drive back full of berating and demeaning comments, we get back to the hotel room. It‚Äôs here she tells me that I am not to speak to her until we are back at our house in Colorado, and if she knew I was like this, she would‚Äôve never let me take her on a date 3 years ago. Sorry for any grammar, punctuation, or sentence structure errors, as I am very flustered, depressed, and anxious at the moment. If this subreddit has any ideas or helpful insight I‚Äôd be glad to hear it. Thanks for reading.

t3_dlom4q,I [31F] don't think I want to be married to my [32M] husband anymore,"When my husband and I got together 7 years ago we were very different people. I was depressed and not motivated and had very low self esteem. He was a drug user, wasn't working and had no car. I bought him a car and helped him get on his feet. He lied to me a lot, he stole from me and I forgave him. Now I'm realizing this was because I had no self worth and I was just settling.

He now is clean but he has no gumption, he flies off the handle, he still has low self esteem and is constantly accusing me of cheating. He's also controlling and very critical and bossy. I on the other hand have worked on myself. I lost a lot of weight, I work out, I try hard at everything I do and I'm really having quite a glow up and have been working really hard to be the best me. The truth is though that my heart just isn't in it anymore. I dread coming home from work, I hate being around him and he's very discouraging of my progress. When I'm around him I just feel dead inside. I just feel so guilty about even thinking about leaving. I'm panicking because I realized that I deserve better way too late and now I feel trapped and guilty for wanting to leave. I've told him that he needs to try harder and treat me better but nothing changes and I just don't know where to go from here.

t3_dlro6e,Never in my life would I think I could be in this situation.....,"TLDR; I have.two girls who I'm madly in love with.
It's a fucking cluster fuck. I didn't even think it's possible. My mind is running at 5000km/second. It is true love. I've been in relationships. I would die for these 2 girls...


So how did this happen? I met one girl, 2 years ago. Call her A, she isn't from my country.  But we lived in the same country for a while. Fell in love, never been so happy, we moved together for 6 months. Amazing period of my life. I enjoyed every moment with her. Then the darkness came.. she had to move back to her country, and we started a LDR. And it worked fine, for 1 year. We visited eachother . Our relationship is too strong to be broken...

We talk every day, every day more than ones. I don't recall one day in the past 2 years where I didn't talk with her. It's kinda crazy, maybe normal, but I really do love her . I would take a bullet for her...


However, the relationship couldn't sustain in terms of sexual desire. I need it, maybe she needs it. I decided to ask for permission to find another girl with benefits... After a very long mature discussion about my desires and my feelings, she agreed (I beg you not to give me this ""if you truly loved her you would wait, because sexual desires is plain sexual)...


But what she feared the most happens, I met with girl B,and asked her to be friends with benefits,, explained her the situation. At first she didn't make up her mind,, but she did still meet with me and kiss me because I guess she liked it. I made sure she's aware that the relationship won't last more than 5 months and that I talk to A every day. 
However, girl B is (unluckily) a one in a million. Her personality is charming. She's the nicest girl I've ever met. She is just pure. She just care for people, she is cute and I fell for her too.

Now I'm in a fucking clown fiesta . I don't know what I'm doing, and how did I reach a fucking situation where I say I love you to 2 different girls. The thought of this makes me want to suicide.",relationship_advice

t3_dlmiqm,Am I [24m] right to think that my gf [22f] overreacted and blew up on me?,"**Backround:** I've never had prescriptions before unlike my gf who has had them quite regularly. She recently saw someone to get back on medication she had been off of awhile. She got the script yesterday and asked me if I could drive out to the pharmacy 20 min away to drop it off.

I agreed and went to drop it off. I made sure they had a contact number and then left the building. When I texted my gf about it, she asked if I asked what time they will be ready for pickup. I did not. I assumed (since no experience with pharmacies) that theyd either call you when it's ready or you can call them and ask if it's ready. My gf got very mad at me, saying now her mom (who will pick up the medication) might show up at the wrong time.

She sent me the following texts that I have not replied to yet.

""Her: Think about it. If you had asked somebody to pick a prescription up for you wouldn't that person want to know what time it's ready so that they can go get it when it's ready and not go get it before it's ready or wait until the next day when after the freaking company is closed are you stupid?

It has nothing to do with a pharmacy or prescriptions it has everything to do with do you understand common courtesy. If so is picking something up for you or you're going to pick something up would you like to know when it would be ready so you could plan when you're going to go pick it up.? That is common sense

Now you got me pissed off because you're a dumb fuck and you can't even wrap your mind around your own stupidity so you act like it's on me it's not.""

I decided to go straight to work so I won't see her the rest of the day. Was this an overreaction by her? How do I respond? All I was trying to do was a favor and I feel like this isnt that big of a mistake that I made.

**tl;dr** Did my gf overreact here?

t3_dlrj6b,(21M) really confused about a potential relationship with a woman(20F),"So due to a relationship that was really toxic I haven't dated in years. A couple weeks ago I met this girl on Tinder and we hit it off real well, I flirted and she reciprocated. We got to talking about what we're looking for in relationships so I was honest and she was like ""we're perfect for each other"" she seemed really into it. 

Now. There is a bit of an issue. I live in Holyoke and she lives in Connecticut. We haven't met yet but she seems (or seemed) to be very excited to do so... She says she just doesn't have the time and she doesn't know when she will. Understandable because of the distance. 

One thing I'm noticing now though that's kinda setting off some alarm bells is that communication is kinda drying up. She always texts me in the morning and I text back when I can, but it's usually a really short conversation and then she disappears again. 

I asked her today ""hey, we good?"" And she was telling me hey yeah I'm just busy, I don't intend to ghost you etc. 

Just, I dunno. When we do talk it usually turns romantic and she gets super cuddly and stuff, but we rarely talk. I don't know what to think. I've been telling myself we're just starting out but I wonder if this will become a pattern. 

Thoughts? She may be genuinely busy. I'm not going to lie to myself this time so I'm keeping an open mind.

Oh another thing, I usually text her in the evenings so it could be a time thing as well

t3_dlofzk,"I [25M] was told by my GF [24F] that my actions were controlling -- was I, and if so how do I be better next time?","GF and I been dating for ~6 months. Before we started dating and one time since we started, she has had a few bad nights with alcohol. Not to the point where she has a legitimate problem, but she isn't the best about managing her alcohol intake. After an incident about a month ago where she went too far and I had to take care of her all night, I talked with her about it, and she conceded that she should have people during the night keep her accountable and she would watch how much she drank. This conversation was mutually received -- she didn't want to go that far either and did want to make sure she didn't go overboard again.

She has a party coming up where we both know there would be alcohol, and last week I went to one of her closest friends and basically told her I was concerned and to just keep an eye out for her to make sure she is ok during the party. I didn't ask her to limit her intake or guardian her, but moreso just make sure she would be ok during the night. I would be at this party too anyways, but I just wanted one more person to make sure she was ok.

Anyways, my GF talked with this friend recently and then got upset with me about going behind her back. From my eyes, I really was just trying to make sure she was going to be ok during the night. She viewed it as mistrust, since she told me she would be better. She said since that point there had been times where alcohol had been present and she had either turned it down or been good about keeping herself at a comfortable level. However we don't talk about literally everything in our lives so I didn't know that. But she felt like this could be seen as a bit controlling. I have no problem with her going out and drinking and I don't limit it at all, but most people seem to think I'm in the wrong here.

If this really is controlling behavior, how can I remedy my thought process? I genuinely wanted to just make sure she was gonna be ok during the night -- is this something I just should have trust in her to be able to do? I felt that asking a friend to make sure she would be ok wasn't that big of a deal. If the roles were reversed, I would not have minded, and if anything would have thought it was nice that they made sure someone was looking out for me.

Its not looking good guys. Our history - we have been married for over 8 years (we met just out of high school) and we have 3 kids ages 3-8. Our marriage has been pretty awesome for first 5 or so years then started to get a little rocky.

Of course when the first kid came along the alone time we enjoyed pretty much evaporated and now with 3 kids its nearly impossible. We've had a few minor fights but nothing too serious. 

Last month I messed up and didn't schedule a short get away while we had the chance. I didn't partially because I kind of wanted to just to stay home and do nothing for once and partially because she made a comment about going to see a friend during that time. So i assumed that she would just go see a friend. Big mistake.

She got really really upset and said we should separate and i should start seeing a counselor because I'm never emotionally there for her and haven't been for over a year. We started counceling and agreed that living apart wouldn't be the best idea.

Fast forward to now and she just got back from a work trip and pretty much ghosted me, she wouldnt even kiss me on the lips. She barely talked to me before she left too. Last night she suggested separation again and we had a big blow out again and now i have till the end of November to find a place to stay. 

Her ghosting me felt off to me and i ended up looking at our phone logs and turns out shes been texting pretty much everyone but me. Especially her boss, it looks like almost every night they text until after midnight or later then first thing the next day. I usually go to sleep early because i work very early in the morning.

Lately it has come to my attention that he is showing a lot of signs that come with depression. I feel like he hasn‚Äôt been taking the after-effects of his past seriously. I have suggested therapy for him a few times in the past, because I know that there is stuff to be dealt with after a past like his. Still, I feel like he just brushes it off. He says things like ¬´Im just myself¬ª, which has nothing to do with it and just doesn‚Äôt make sense as a response in my opinion. I‚Äôm worried about him and I think therapy could help him a lot. I get that he isn‚Äôt ready for it yet, but how do I help him? Im trying to be there for him and support him as much as possible. I will start therapy myself soon, would I be naive to think that it could help him come around to the idea?

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!",relationship_advice
t3_dlodly,After an argument I (23M) isn't quite sure about my relationship with my girlfriend (25F),"After and argument with my gf (8 months of relationship) , I started to think about everything in my life. I find my life shitty as hell. I may be hard to myself, but I know that being lazy playing games isn't the best option.
To explain, I'm a student in cinema, but my studies don't attract me anymore and it's really hard to get motivated because I lack interest as it's not what I want to do in my life. It has been a long time since I had this thought about my studies. I'm still looking for ways to find something that motivates me, new studies and stuff.
With that, add the fact that, I have plans to escape this, like write on a blog, but I never did anything. It's still in process and I can't get back at it.
So, all of it (and other stuff like not seeking help or anything) lead me slowly to depression each day. Not the best thing to happen, eh.

Now that all of this is settled and introduce, my gf and I had this argument a week ago about me being not as close to her as before, I don't see my future with her, and, losing my feelings towards her. We broke up, pretty violently actually. We are still in some sort of contact and. I don't know what I'm feeling anymore.
I think atill I love her, and kinda want her back, but I'm asking myself if that's not because of the memories instead of passion. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared thay, if we go back together, I'll hurt her as I did before. She is the person who made me the most happy and opened like no one before. 

Does anyone had the same problem? Or could help me see things more clearly? I'll gladly take your advice. Thanks a lot",relationship_advice
t3_dlrfpx,I am in love with my coworker and he has no idea,"I (36f) have worked with him (31m) for 8 months. In my first month there we had sex. It was great. I‚Äôve had sex with a lot of people since and nothing has come even close.  Since then it has been a platonic friendship. Neither of us has made any kind of romantic move, but we do hang out. In fact I‚Äôd say we are good friends as I dogsit for him when he‚Äôs out of town on tour etc. We have a ton in common, are both in same job field (bullshit LA bartenders), and at least at one point had a mutual physical attraction. I do pretty well with men. I‚Äôm fun and I guess ‚Äúhot‚Äù, but no one has effected me like him. Maybe in my life. I‚Äôm in love with him and can see myself being in a serious relationship with him. The dumb annoying things he does aren‚Äôt a turn off. His messy bathroom doesn‚Äôt gross me out. I‚Äôll move his car at 3am in fucking Hollywood happily so he doesn‚Äôt get a ticket. I want to tell him but I‚Äôm terrified of the rejection. I‚Äôm usually such an ice queen- but this dude got under my skin and there he stayed.

t3_dlkyya,I don‚Äôt know how to handle my feelings towards this girl I like.,"So I‚Äôve kinda lost feelings for the crush I had before. She was attractive but she just wasn‚Äôt my type personality wise, and she is trying to get back with her ex, so things with her and I didn‚Äôt go much past the friend stage.

As we‚Äôve been hanging out more, I‚Äôve noticed that I like her friend more. We have more things in common and she‚Äôs a very outgoing and nice person. There‚Äôs a problem though. She and another friend of ours have a thing for each other, but they don‚Äôt really vibe well together and the guy told me he doesn‚Äôt think the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù (but not really) will last long, and it overall seems like it‚Äôs not that serious.

t3_dlmct0,My [26M] SO [24F] wants to cut back on how much we're in touch,"I posted on here a couple days ago regarding this, but I find myself wanting more advice (OP linked below)

Long story short, we've been dating around a year. It's been amazing, but we decided not to put any concrete labels on ourselves. Over the summer we worked for the same company in a remote location and shared a room (basically lived and worked together for a while). We've always been LD, but not so far apart we couldnt meet up every few weeks. A few days ago she said that she had felt stifled since then, and felt she had lost her independence. She said our level of contact with one another was unsustainable, and she wanted to go from texting daily and talking on the phone every few days to talking weekly, but still visiting every few weeks to a month. She asked me not to contact her for at least a week so she could think, and we haven't spoken since.

Has anyone else moved too quickly, and found a better balance by slowing down and reducing contact? I have no interest in being touch with her any less, but I'm happy to compromise within reason.

t3_dlobwp,Girlfriend is negative a lot of the time and idk how to address it,"Hey guys,

My (21M) girlfriend (20F) is negative a lot of time and will complain about work, friends colleagues etc. Everyday. She has diagnosed depression but isn't seeing therapist and isn't on any antidepressants and I'm starting to feel like her therapist as she complains to me a lot. I will always love and support her but this is getting to me now and has resulted in me either brushing over her complains or not acknowledging them at all (which is really not mature and doesn't help). I want to communicate it with her without her feeling like a burden (which in theory is impossible?) but I cant begin to articulate it without my frustration coming through. 

I've tried to convince her to see a therapist but she just says she hates talking about anything but has said she is open to taking antidepressants and has a doctors appointment next Monday, hopefully to get this arranged. She's started to notice me get shorter with my replies and it doesn't at all feel fair to leave her in the dark as to why but I'm just scared I'll do more damage. She doesn't talk to many other people about her problems so I don't want her to just bottle it up and for it to get worse. Thanks.",relationship_advice
t3_dlobli,Am I (20F) a bad person for considering breaking up with BF (20M) because of his ADHD?,"Been together for almost two years. We go to the same uni and study the same thing (CS). 

I am getting very tired of having to tell him when/how/what to do every single day. I have to remind him of almost everything because if I don‚Äôt, he will forget. I can‚Äôt trust him to do most things on his own. Sometimes he just has no common sense whatsoever. Whenever I talk to him, I have an extra task of making sure he paid attention and fully understood what I communicated to him. He can‚Äôt read long-ish texts because he defocuses and completely misses the message. His academic performance hasn‚Äôt been great due to his unmedicated illness (which worries me about his future an unhealthy amount). I find myself constantly re-teaching him what was taught in class for the classes that we take together because he just can‚Äôt seem to absorb information fast enough. He tends to be a bit irresponsible sometimes for things that have huge importance - this personally drives me insane but I am learning to be understanding. I‚Äôve also noticed he has trouble prioritizing, a characteristic people with ADHD exhibit, however, I don‚Äôt think he notices he has this problem. He also sometimes appears uneducated and unprofessional because of the way he expresses himself (this might just have to do with the way he was raised, though). 

Because of his inn-attentiveness, I tend to feel neglected, unappreciated, unloved and uncared for. I also sometimes don‚Äôt feel like my emotional needs are being met. Yes, I have communicated this to him. He knows and he‚Äôs aware. Yet, I am yet to see a real, significant and CONSISTENT improvement.

I love him like I‚Äôve never loved anyone before. He is my best friend, my life (and business) partner and I care about him deeply. I cannot picture my life without him. But I am getting worn out and I feel like a bad person for this. Shouldn‚Äôt I, his girlfriend and life partner, be there for him and help him in any way I can? I feel like I have been doing this, but to no avail because things don‚Äôt seem to change. 

He used to be medicated when he was younger, but stopped taking his meds years ago. I recently found a psychiatrist for him and he went and got a new prescription for some new pills from the doctor. That was about two weeks ago. He has yet to go to the pharmacy to get the pills. I stopped reminding him last week. 

It breaks my heart to even contemplate the idea of breaking up with him, but I am so exhausted of feeling this way. Breaking up feels like a mistake, but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt keep feeling like his secretary that is also his occasional lover. Please help me figure this out. I don‚Äôt want to break up, I just want him to get better so I can feel free of this toll that I have on me. How do I help him in a way that doesn‚Äôt cost me my mental health? I just want to feel loved and appreciated and like we are equals going on the same wavelength in this relationship, but, more often than not, I feel like his mom. 



TL;DR: BF has unmedicated ADHD. This is affecting my relationship with him because I tend to feel like I have to do most things for him. I am getting worn out and feel guilty for contemplating breaking up. Please help.",relationship_advice
t3_dlhv4p,I wish i had more friends and love,"Hello redditors i would like some advice on this topic you see above.

A bit about me: I'm a 20 year old woman who has troubles making friends or finding the one.

Now, you might think it's obvious that she's into me, but the thing that makes me doubt this is that she's got a MASSIVE snapscore of over 1 and a half million. She's also got just over a thousand instagram followers, and she's told me about times when she's kissed other guys. For all I know, I could be getting lead on.

t3_dlo92y,I'm over the girl. But how do I get over how the relationship ended?,"My first serious relationship with someone ended pretty abruptly. Almost 2 years ago. I thought that over time, and by reading through this subreddit, I'd eventually get over my curiosity and how it bugs me to not understand why exactly I was broken up with. It doesn't bug me as constantly as it used to, but it still irritates me.

For context: it was a long distance relationship - I went to a school two and a half hours away. We met through tinder on my first weekend back visiting home. Distance sucked, but we got through it and it never caused any issues between us, we never wanted to see anyone else, nothing like that. We are different people, do having a deep relationship with anyone else is a rarity. The distance sucked on occasion, but we Skyped every night for an hour at least, so it wasn't an issue.

The relationship only lasted 3 months. We only ever had two fights, both over Skype, not in person. Both were my fault, though my outburst during one was a bit justified, though too much tbh. 

It's hard to remember the timeline, it was a long time ago. But I don't think the last fight was close enough to be the cause. But I could be wrong. She ended things by saying that she needed to break up with me in order to focus on her mental health. We had never had trust issues in the relationship. In fact mine were completely cured by this relationship. But she stated that she had started to have issues again - her ex was abusive and cheated - and she knew she was wrong to have them with me, and told me she was going to be alone for awhile and see a therapist. Didn't talk this through in detail, was very emotionally stable and to the point with every response, which came much more slowly now. She responded but didn't give me room to negotiate. It was happening and I just had to deal with it. She had every right to be on her own and leave me. And she didn't HAVE to tell me anything at all. But as my partner, I expected closure, and not such a out of the blue, devastating, ending conclusion with no hope in sight. 

I go to school at home now, and I will see her after my first class every Tuesday and Thursday. My question to you is this: do I ask her the real reason for why she broke up with me? Because I want to grow, and if I did something wrong, or didn't do something, I want to know in order to work on it and become a better person and lover for myself, and whoever I get with in the future. I wouldn't do it in a confronting manner, but calmly as a matter of curiousity. But should I do it? After so long? Or should I just suck it up and try to just forget about it and accept that whatever the reason, it doesn't matter because I'm a good person and she wasn't for me? But ultimately, I still just want to know. And asking would not be emotionally difficult for me. I just worry how it would go across to her socially, after almost 2 years. 

Also, it may be important, she's in a relationship now with a woman. She only came out as bi awhile after we broke up. I draw no conclusions from this personally. We talked too much for her to be cheating, and I really still believe it's not in her character to have done so.

Edit: I should also clarify that when I see her after class, it's because she works downstairs in the library. She won't have co-workers or her boss around, but it might still be a bad place to approach her, regardless of if she's busy. Im not sure about it personally. I added her back on Instagram about a month ago. Which is the best way to approach her with these options in mind?",relationship_advice
t3_dlkv6r,I'm (31M) feeling alone here and need some advice on loving someone with alcoholism and an eating disorder (29F).,"I'm finding this a bit hard to get all my thoughts on paper, and don't want this to be a big block of text, so I'll go with a bulleted list.

* I'm wild about this girl and we are perfect for each other in every way aside from these issues. She's hands down the best partner I've ever had
* We started dating a bit over a year ago, and she never explicitly told me about either of these issues. I had to discover them and confront her on my own. I feel a bit misled and like our foundation of trust was somewhat built on an incomplete picture (but I trust her on everything else)
* Alcoholism runs in my immediate family and I had a past SO with an eating disorder so I'm unfortunately intimately familiar with both issues. It also runs in her immediate family.
* Drinking is her go-to for unwinding/pushing away her anxiety/general dissatisfaction. She will get drinks after work and drink on the train on the way home (used to do it in the car until she sold it so that she wouldn't do it anymore) and continues to drink once home
* I am a social drinker, but lately I've tried to cut back to set a good example
* I also regularly go to the gym and have gotten her to come along with me a bit
* She often will fall asleep while we're watching tv and whatnot after work so it's hard for us to finish shows and movies together sometimes
* She has lied to me on multiple occasions about whether she's had anything to drink, as well as whether she's had a bad day with food (I get that this is a very complicated thing, and that she's lying to herself just as much as lying to me)
* A few weeks ago she told me she wasn't sure she'd ever be able to stop lying to me about it
* She has seen therapists off and on but always ends up switching therapists and now isn't seeing anyone
* She isn't happy career-wise, so I've spent time at work on helping her strategize how she can make changes, as well as partially making a resume for her to use. She hasn't done anything about it on her end yet.
* I have expressed to her numerous times that I am here for her and support her through everything, but that I just can't really handle being lied to about it because it makes me feel like we're not on the same team.
* I've also expressed that I really need her to work on these issues so that we can have a long, happy, healthy future together.
* I haven't given her an ultimatum yet (e.g. it's me or the alcohol) because I'm fucking terrified and afraid I won't be able to stick to it
* Last night I came home and she was passed out on the bed from drinking at 10:30 PM. She mumbled in her sleep ""I don't want to let you go"". I'd just gone to the gym and was looking forward to a night in bed with her / a night reading books together. Instead I sat on the edge of the bed crying.
* I am so in love with the person this woman can be when she's sober and healthy. When she's healthy, we're both on the same page and I can see us both moving in together, getting pets, and growing old and being happy etc
* But honestly, it's hard for me not to see a life long struggle against her mental health issues, because she seems to be unwilling to truly work on them at this moment in time. This brings up other issues, like I'm not sure I'd ever feel comfortable having children together although we've both expressed that we want to.

Would love some outsider perspectives here, or some thoughts on people who have been through this themselves. Thank you all &lt;3",relationship_advice
t3_dlm8tx,M(20) Need Help Diffusing Mixed Signals,"So let me start by saying I have very little experience dating. Mostly I just focused on work for the last two years and this is the first time I've tried to be with a girl since high school, (I'm gonna call her Ann on here.) So I met Ann on tinder, even from the start she was cute, but weird. She pretty much always gave one word responses to any text I sent her, but she seemed like she enjoyed talking. I asked her out for dinner and she agreed, we went and seemed to have a good time. After that she started sending me good morning messages on Snapchat pretty much everyday. She'd also text me like 3 times a day but would only ever respond with one word answers whenever I tried to talk to her.  She's in college and so I'm sure she's busy, but whenever she'd message back it felt like she just doesn't wanna talk. Then our second date is to the Renaissance festival. We walk around and check out shops, I bought her an outfit and then she left. She only stayed for about an hour and total and said she had homework to do. This was seconds after I stopped buying her things. I didn't say anything but I was really upset, then she messaged me and asked if she made me upset, I told her I was fine but she kept apologizing and saying she just has issues opening up to guys and was uncomfortable because I wanted to put my arm around her. I should clarify that she did not ask for me to buy her things at first, and I don't mind buying her things as long as that's not all she wants me to be. She then said she wants to come over to my place and cook me dinner. That's where we are now. I'm not sure what we even are, like she has flat out said she wants us to be together but I still can't figure her out. Also I don't think I'm being clingy because I never message her first, she's always the one who contacts me.

t3_dlktng,Does my (F24) best friend (M26) have feelings for me after 7 years??,"I think that my best friend and I are falling for each other but I'm not 100% sure and don't know how to proceed. I REALLY need your help and apologize for the long post, but I think the context is necessary.

**So for some background:** I have been BEST friends with this guy since college, so for going on 7 years now. When we initially met, there was an attraction between us (we are 100% each others types), and I was SUPER into him, but he was not interested in pursuing a real relationship and we just hooked up every now and then for a few years (no sex, just making out etc.) I was sad at first that he didn't want me in that way but I honestly got over it and was able to 100% respect his feelings and move forward with zero expectation that our friendship would ever be anything more.

Over the past 7 years, we have grown ridiculously close. He will text me first thing in the morning and we text each other all day long (response times within 10 minutes always unless one of us are in a meeting or something), we just really love being around each other. We have the EXACT SAME value system and political leanings. We have such a free and easy relationship. We can say to one another ""I need attention"" and the other person is on it. Or if we really need to talk, we can immedietly double text the other person to ""RESPOND RN"" and we are both happy to do it. It seems small, but they are just examples that we really feel at ease with each other and there is never any sort of judgement in our friendship, we say what we need and the other person is always willing to provide it. We are both very introverted, but not at all around each other and we make exceptions for each other that we don't for anyone else. For example: he's SUUUPER into gaming. Like RIDICULOUSLY so. He leaves work to play immediately everyday for hours. However, I just recently realized that he never takes more than a couple of minutes to text me back, which means that he constantly pauses or ignores his gaming just so that he can respond as soon as I text him. He has NEVER said to me ""can we talk later, I'm gaming."" Come to think of it, he has NEVER said that he needs to do anything else when I want to talk to him.

I can tell him anything and when we are together, its non-stop laughing and fun on top of our sexual attraction to one another, which we freely talk about. We joke around, make fun of each other, play fight, and we just GET each other, if you know what I mean. He tells me all the time that I'm his best friend in the world and he is definitely mine. I mean this guy has been through hell and back with me and has always wanted to be by my side, and I've done the same for him. Most friends would grow apart in some ways over a 7 year span (as things in your life change, and especially in the college to adulthood transition) but we have ONLY grown more compatible as friends and more attracted to each other.

**So 5 months ago:** I moved back to the city in which we attended college (he never left after college, it's a major city) and asked him out on a date, not looking for something serious. I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship and hadn't seen my friend for a couple of years (went to grad school in a far away city.) Honestly it probably wasn't the smartest thing to do, but after that relationship, I felt a bit of my feelings for my best friend coming back. He told me he'd be happy going on a casual date but wasn't looking for a serious relationship. No hard feelings at all from this, he actually hasn't dated in years. So we ultimately decide to just keep hanging out as friends, flirting, and things go smoothly, as they always do with him. I actually lost feelings for him entirely, to the point where I was excited to help him edit his dating app profile a few weeks later. About 6 weeks after that, I got into a relationship with another guy. My boyfriend was really awesome and fun, and he is an amazing human being. My bestfriend was really excited to meet my then boyfriend because ""he is really important to you."" My boyfriend and I got along well but after a few months, decided we weren't headed down the same life paths. My best friend helped me through all of this and even encouraged me to try and patch things up with my ex.

**Which brings us to now:** I cried out the loss of my ex for a couple of days, but overall moved on quickly. I mentioned maybe going on dates with a guy that I knew and generally started talking about guys as I was trying to move on. But I noticed his response was different now, before he never cared if I talked about men. This time, I could tell it was making him upset, so I stopped. About a week ago, I was dealing with those feelings of anger towards my ex, you know, just part of the normal grieving process. So I called my best friend. He picked up immediately and we proceeded to talk on the phone for 5 hours, until 3am on a weekday. He let me talk exclusively for the first two hours, just venting everything that I was feeling and supporting me more than anyone ever has.

For the next three hours we just laughed and flirted. He was telling me how he has all of the pictures I have sent him saved in his ""favorites"" folder, he has my picture as his lock screen, has my contact saved as ""bby"" etc. I was laughing at one of the pictures I had sent but he just wanted to talk about ""how cute my ear is"" or ""how adorable I looked"" when I made a certain expression. These seemed like distinctly different compliments from what he normally will say (things like, ""you're cute"", or ""you look good"") what he was saying felt more intimate. When we decided to go to bed, we said goodbyes and he quickly ended the call by saying ""love you...,"" and I said the same. We have never said that to each other before and he certainly was never the type to express those kinds of feelings (he's not the emotional or mushy type in ANY way). After we hung up, he texted me immediately saying how he wanted to kiss my forehead and cuddle me all night.

**So since then:** We have been flirting hardcore. Yeah, we have always explicitly flirted, but this is...just different. Before, our relationship was entirely platonic (calling each other dude/bro etc) except for the flirtation which was always strictly sexual, not romantic in any way). Suddenly, he is saying how ""he just can't wait to see me,"" he wants to do all of the things he knows I like to do, even things I know he doesn't like. He does not tolerate any of my normal self-depreciation (it's like he gets offended now when I say that I'm ugly or dumb, which I always do jokingly). He's letting me in on his gaming activities and his super close knit relationship with his cousins and other family members. He wants to spend a lot of time with me and wants to give me his favorite hoodie.

Last time I saw him, a couple of days ago, he brought me really considerate gifts that show he listens to and remembers even small things I said in passing months ago. We were hanging out at his place and I caught him staring at me a lot and he kept giving me kisses out of nowhere. It was all so sweet. I'm not sure however, that it felt ""romantic,"" at least not in the ""let me stare into your eyes forever and just the thought of you brings me to tears"" sort of movie romance. Perhaps it's just because we have already been so close for so long? We were basically your typical ""bros"" before. I do, however, remember leaving and simply thinking ""wow....I really am in love with him.""

Anyways, since I saw him 2 days ago, it's calmed down a bit, but he'll still do things like call me princess and tell me that I'm cute. I've talked to 4 of my closest friends (guys and girls - all of whom have known me for 10+ years and have seen the evolution of my relationship with my best friend) and even the one's who were warning me that he didn't want a relationship with me all those years ago and telling me to give up, are now saying that they 100% think he's into me and wants me long-term. They said it's simply obvious. He's in a different time zone for work rn and constantly around his boss so we are texting a bit less, which is giving me more time to think about all of this. So of course, I am turning to Reddit for help....

TL;DR -  I think that my best friend (M26) and I (F24) might be falling for one another... but because I've asked him out before and have been turned down, I'm not sure that I trust myself to see what is going on clearly and I'm not sure how I should proceed.",relationship_advice
t3_dlr9uc,I [M28] / gf[F27] First relationship and sexual encounter for both. 2 months in I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed,"About 3 months ago I match with this girl on tinder, and we immediately hit it off. I feel our conversation going great etc. A week in, and I'm totally hooked. I just love talking to her. We try to meet up two times but it never actually happened. After that she goes silent. During the next 2-3 weeks I probably drank as much as the rest of the summer. I know it sounds silly being so invested to a random person I've only chatted to online, but it's hard being 28 and never having felt loved. I just needed the ""forever alone"" voice to shut up for a bit, and for my feelings to... well, die. Essentially, I went through what I perceived as rejection and I took it quite hard. To be honest, I'm not sure why I didn't unmatch at that point. They say hope dies last.

Indeed, out of the blue I get a message from her. We chat for a couple of days, and *she* actually asks *me* out. On the first date we have a lot of fun, in the end we make out. Second date, literally the next day, we end up at my place, where she informs me she's also a virgin, we get to 3rd base and she stays the night. This is were it starts going downhill for me. She starts texting heart emojis, heart-eyed gifs (reminder: after 2nd date), suggesting weekend getaways etc. Not much later, she starts making comments about what type of presents she'd like for her birthday (6 months away), a surprise party for my birthday (9 months away) and just progresses into how it would be fun to move in together, how we'll spend New Year's Eve together etc. All this and we've only known each other for 2 weeks at that point, so I'm extremely stressed, freaking out a bit. I decided to try and weather it out, ""maybe it's just her saying things out of awkwardness"" I thought.

Now, two months later I find myself completely overwhelmed. Firstly, I feel that she's way more invested emotionally than what I am. Heart emojis, cute gifs and nicknames just keep flying my way, and every single one creates a not-positive emotion. I'm nowhere near that, and it's quite uncomfortable just being in this position, as I feel there are certain expectations I cannot meet.  
Secondly, when we're not together we'll have long calls, in addition to a couple of hours of chatting. She was out of town for a weekend and I was getting updates every 15-20 minutes for 11 hours straight. I might ask a simple question, and get a 20-30 message reply, write another comment or remark on what she said, 10-15 messages again, etc etc. Currently I'm afraid of asking how her day was, because I will most likely get in a never ending conversation. Literally, she's ended the conversation maybe twice. Part of this I attribute to her being without a real social group, due to her friends being abroad. She's never said she's going out with ""X"" friend to catch up or something. This makes me feel bad when I decide to spend time with my friends and have to turn her down.  
On a different matter, sex hasn't really happened as she's in pain the few times we've tried. She's quite happy in that department from oral and fingering, but I haven't been able to cum with her. It otherwise works fine, when I'm alone. I don't know if it's something about expectations in my mind because she gave me blue balls the first few times (I actually ended up with ice down there twice), if it's all the stress created from her comments and general attitude, or if it's just her skill. I must admit never heard of yanking it, wouldn't recommend. I think it's understandable when I say I'm not specially looking forward to antics again, when I haven't been able to finish. 

Obviously we went into this with completely different mindsets. Is seems she just absolutely wanted a relationship with someone, were I was more on team ""let's see how this goes"". I knew I should take it slow, but excitement got the better part of me. I feel I've ended up in a relationship I never agreed to. Currently, I do not feel in the mood like continuing much longer. I don't know the way I feel can change just like that, when it hasn't happened in the two moths we've been seeing each other. My options seem to be first, to just ""break up"". To be honest, I'm kind of afraid of doing that because, I mean it took 28 years to get find someone.

Second would be to have a discussion about the most aggravating part, which is the communication when we're not together. Try to explain that I just do not chat online or on the phone, with anyone that's in my city. I'll share a meme or two, news, and make plans. That's about it. I hope that if that's toned down to a more acceptable level for me,  I might be able to relax a bit and have some fun. However, that doesn't do anything about how we're both on different levels.

I would like to hear if you agree with any of the two or you have something different to suggest. I'm open to every suggestion as I have no idea what I'm doing here!",relationship_advice
t3_dlm51x,Business trip lie.,"My boyfriend and I fought about his business trip he was going on a week ago. He's always had this problem of being way too friendly with girls he works with. I've had various times where girls have came up to me saying my boyfriend acts so friendly and flirty when I'm not around, but the moment I am around he ignores them. We've had trust issues constantly as he would always lie about talking to these individuals and the seriousness of his friendships between them. I've come across so many girls who have gotten in my face about how when I do approach them that it isn't their fault he lies and does those things and acts a certain way when I am around. Which they are completely right, I can't get mad at those girls when my bf is the one initiating the conversations and the flirting. It just sucks that those individuals go along with it. What saddens me the most is that he continues to lie , and make promises he won't keep. Whether it's he'll stop acting a certain way with them to him supposedly ending the friendships. While at a work related party that I attended with my bf I noticed the same actions happening from the past. Where certain females, where extremely touchy and flirty with inside jokes with my bf. 
So fast forward to his business trip...
I had a gut feeling these individuals who were extremely flirty and touchy with him would be there. We fought and he even attempted to end our relationship. The trip came, and he swore up and down that it was only him and 2 guys and one female on the trip. I found out today from an Instagram post that the two females I was uncomfortable about him being around went on that same trip with him. 
I don't understand how people can easily lie to someone they supposedly love. How he can get so angry with me when I'd ask for reassurance and for him to talk to me on the trip when in the end my gut feeling was right !",relationship_advice

t3_dlo3se,How to let someone go?,"I (22F) am having serious trouble letting go of someone I thought to be my best friend (21M).

We could have been more, but we were not. We've been through it all: drug addiction, anxiety + depression, visiting each other while we were each abroad (Asia + Europe, both from US). We used to hang out anywhere between 2-3 times a week. Text almost every day.

All of a sudden, after I admitted to being suicidal, he ghosted me. Out of the blue. Then sent me, imo, rude messages saying things like ""I said I'd be there for you, but you overstayed your welcome"" and ""this relationship does nothing for me anymore"". I am currently in an intensive treatment program for my mental health, and last night he finally agreed to talk to me and said that he's closing the chapter of our lives.

I am not coping or understanding this situation at all. I feel discarded and worthless, and I don't know how to handle this. I feel like our three year friendship meant nothing.

The link above is for the original post. I'm still new on Reddit please forgive me.

After posting here about how I bumped into text exchange between my bf and his ex which were very suggestive, some of you asked me to keep off his phone (we have free access to each other's phones) and some asked me to confront him. If you read the original post you'll note that we hardly spent so much time together because he got a new job (8 am-8pm) and since we don't live together it's hard to meet. So I hadn't seen him in two weeks and we planned a date out of town and we had a good time and I was planning on telling him about the texts that I found out but I didn't get the time (or didn't wanna ruin the moment) Quick forward to today he got off work early and we decided to hang out at his place. I noted he kept his phone to himself unlike before but I really didn't bother I was in a good mood. So we used mine to check out funny stuff on IG until I showed him a video that I had on my phone and he asked me to send him. I did. And since I was laying on his chest I had a clear view of his phone and guess who appears on top of the chats? You're right. The ex. The texts had cute emojis and I let curiosity get the best of me. When he went to the bathroom I snooped. Well it seemed they had been talking and she asked him if they should plan trips to random places and he was cool with it.  She asked him for a suggestion and he said she should come to his place to watch a movie. The ex was like no that would be offensive to your gf and my bf was like yeah it was just a suggestion. Also it seemed like they were together on Friday coz she told him it was nice seeing him and she was hoping he got home safe. They haven't talked since then.

I don't even know why I'm posting. Maybe I want y'all to tell me ""I told you"". He clearly has feelings for her or he just wants to cheat.

My gf and I have been together for 4 years.  I love her dearly, she is my world. She is very funny, intellectually curious and open.  

I love hanging out with her every chance we get, and we have built a nice life together.

But I am simply not in love with her, and I never was. I dont feel any physical attraction, and I dont think she really does either.  

For the last few months Ive had this ever present sense of dread that we are just not the right for each other and wasting time; 

we do enable each other in some of our most negative attributes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to this, I developed a close bond with a girl from work.  We dont get on in the same way as my gf and I, for starters she isnt funny, and quite conservative.  We have mostly different interests.  '

But it feels different with her, unlike my gf and I now we dont enable each others destructive tendencies and she made me feel like I wanted to be a better person for her, and that there was a future there.  

Due to this I left the job 10 months ago and we decided to cut off contact.  But unfortunately I havent been able to stop thinking about her since.

&amp;#x200B;

If I left my gf, she would be absolutely devastated.  

She has no family in this country and no close friends either, along with an anxiety disorder, which further complicates things.  

But thats just secondary to the fact that I just can't bear the thought of her being alone and upset, I want to be able to take care of her but I dont think I can continue.  How do I approach this?",relationship_advice
t3_dlnx8g,I [27/M] know that my girlfriend [25/F] cares about me but she has a lot of trouble controlling her anger. Should I end things?,"We've been dating for about 4 years at this point. I'm a PhD student in chemical engineering and she currently works full time as a law clerk. We are located in EU, apologize in advance as English is not my first language.

My girlfriend supports me by bringing me food and helping me with household chores when I'm stressed. She thinks about me on her trips and will often bring me a souvenir. She's a caring person and tries hard to show it. We have a lot of shared interests and generally have the same life goals in terms of family, career, salary, ect.

However, she has problems controlling her anger and negative emotions. Recently, I was preparing for my PhD defense and I told her ahead of time that I was going to be very busy and needed to work long hours everyday to finish my experiments, write my manuscripts, and prepare for the defense. I told her we can still see each other, but it would only be once a week because I was so busy.

She seemed understanding at first, but after only two weeks, started getting annoyed we weren't hanging out. Eventually, it resulted in her exploding at me, telling me she felt I didn't care about her, saying we haven't been intimate, etc. all the while I was struggling to meet the demands of my committee professors, losing weight, losing sleep, and sanity. I still feel resentful today because while she tried to be supportive, she only added to my stress at the end. This sort of pattern tends to spark every one of our arguments: she feels a bit frustrated, but then unleashes it without warning sometime later. I try really hard to be sensitive. Whenever I do something involving us, I always ask for her opinion on it because I'm scared she'll get upset. There have been times where she says she's ok with something but then later changes her mind and gets mad at me. I try very very hard, but at the end of the day, I can't pick up every negative signal and I'm not a perfect person. I can only do my best.

This sort of occurrence happens maybe every month or every other month. Sometimes, she will threaten to break up with me. I know she cares about me and I care about her as well. We've discussed therapy but she isn't willing to seriously consider it due to past trauma with a therapist. We always apologize to each other after an argument, but sometimes, I feel like nothing changes on her end. I feel like I've done my part for this relationship. I've gone through therapy, given up hobbies, changed my wardrobe, etc. because in the past, they had resulted in conflict.

I'm at my wits end now and I don't know what to do. After every argument we have, I feel slightly more drained. I act more apprehensive and those eggshells I'm walking on get more and more fragile. She's noticed that I'm getting more distant and maybe in turn she's acting out more. I think our last argument has made me really think about ending things with her. She realized this and really promised to change this time. Unfortunately, I no longer feel comfortable when we hang out. I'm worried she will get upset at something that will spark the next argument.

I guess I'm just venting at this point. Should we break up?

**TL;DR** I love my gf, she is so caring but quick to get angry. Even though she apologizes, I can't handle the anger any more.",relationship_advice

t3_dlnu42,Slowly tearing my relationship apart but I don‚Äôt know how to stop,"My fiancee and I have been together for a couple of years now. I proposed a little over a month ago.

I‚Äôm starting to discover traits and feats in/of myself I can finally name by their appropriate tags. I‚Äôm neurotic, I‚Äôve got anger management issues, I‚Äôve got an insanely stressful job which isn‚Äôt helping any of the above and I‚Äôve never been able to talk about my feelings. 
I‚Äôm also a horribly introverted einzelganger, but I‚Äôve never felt more comfortable with anyone else than with her. I don‚Äôt need alone time from her. Being with her, even if it‚Äôs just on the couch together, or playing videogames for hours on an end barely talking .. it‚Äôs soothing and it calms me down. 

Lately, my job‚Äôs been getting more and more stressful. People are leaving, which is leaving me with more and more responsibility. I‚Äôve graduated a little over a year ago, but I‚Äôm treated the same (responsibilities and workload) as my colleagues with over ten years of experience. Our department has been putting in 50-60 hour workweeks to keep up with the increasing workload, which doensn‚Äôt appear to be lightening anytime soon.

We‚Äôve bought a house a little under a year ago. It was a ‚Äúfix me up‚Äù-er, because it was all we could afford to move to the place we needed to move to for both our jobs. The housing market is exploding here, where we had to choose between a house with a lot of maintenance, or renting an apartment for the same price. Anyway, the renovation is coming along fine, we were already done with the kitchen and the livingroom is just 8 months. However, because of the state of the house (being in the middle of a renovation and some rooms having literal piles of garbage/rubble), we couldn‚Äôt possibly sell the house as is without making insane losses on it.

This is all part of the backstory, as I‚Äôm getting to the conversation we had today.
We‚Äôve been kind of drifting apart the last couple of weeks. After I proposed, we were both happy about getting married. This lasted until our vacation ended (we traveled a week abroad where I proposed). We‚Äôre having lots of arguments, we‚Äôre barely intimate anymore..

When I came home today, I realized I couldn‚Äôt even remember the last time she paid me a compliment. I always try to comment her on the small things, how I like the dinner she made, how she looks nice in a new skirt or blousse she bought .. I can‚Äôt ever express how happy she makes me and how beautiful I find her, but I try to compliment her whenever it pops in my head. Regardless of that, I couldn‚Äôt recall receiving any compliments as of late. She used to tell me the same kind of things, how she liked the way my hair looks today, or that I smell nice.
It lead to me asking why she hadn‚Äôt paid me any recently. I said that I was confused about the way we treated eachother for the past months, and that I felt like she‚Äôs still with me because we couldn‚Äôt possibly get rid of the house, not because she looks forward to seeing me again at the end of her day.

She didn‚Äôt really disagree with it, and it broke me. We talked, and she kept saying how she gets that I have a very stressful job and how she‚Äôs grateful I‚Äôm providing (she also works, I just have some ‚Äúluxury‚Äù money left we get to spend on nice things after the basic necessities we cover together), but the anger issues I‚Äôve had all my life had become unbearable. She still looks forward to seeing me every night, but whenever I get home I‚Äôm stressed and angry and anything little that doesn‚Äôt go my way puts me over the edge where I‚Äôm literally yelling. Whenever I get this angry, I feel this ball of anger inside that I just want to get out, both vocally and physically. 

It‚Äôs becoming more and more regular to get there, and I‚Äôve started slamming my desk or punching walls to try and release the anger I feel inside. It‚Äôs scaring her. I would never even think of hitting her, but I know she genuinely fears the day that I will. Before I started this job (or any full-time job for that matter), I‚Äôd have these outbursts maybe once every couple of months. As of lately, it‚Äôs been weekly, if not bi-daily. 

I don‚Äôt know what I can do to stop it. I think I need to see a psychologist, but they‚Äôre way too expensive for me to afford.

t3_dlr0hl,"I (20M) Got ""rejected"" for the first time, not sure what to do next.","Hopefully this post doesn't sound too much like r/teenagers but I'm genuinely stumped. I asked out this person I was interested in getting to know better and she told me she had a boyfriend (which is fine) but to avoid the awkward aftermath I changed the subject and then went ok my way after a couple minutes. I have no problem with the fact that she is already in a relationship and obviously I'm going to stop any more advances but I'm afraid I just destroyed this person's image of me since I made my intentions known. I genuinely respect this person and I still want to be friends with them but I don't know if I can talk to this person again knowing she knows I had other intentions than just friendship with her.

Compared to other posts on here, obviously this is not a huge deal for most people considering a large amount of people have been in my situation at least once but this is causing me a lot of irrational anxiety given the fact that out of all the relationships I've been in I've never had to deal with any kind of rejection. 

What's the best way for me to salvage this situation ?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqy2d,My boyfriend (20) and I (21F) can‚Äôt see eye to eye months later,"Ive been reading post here for a while and have been contemplating adding my own post. Finally decided to write my first post because this has been an issue for months. Might delete this since he doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm asking for outside opinions. 

Sorry I‚Äôm advance for any grammatical errors or misspelling. 

My boyfriend (20) and I (21F)can‚Äôt seem to see eye to eye on this situation. We have been together for a year and a half and at about our one year mark we had broken up for let‚Äôs say two, no more than three weeks. During that time, it was hard for me since he was one of my best friends before hand and we‚Äôd hang out with mutual friends during our ‚Äúbreak‚Äù however it was hard which did make me sad and still want to be with him and treat him like he was my boyfriend. He was aware I still loved him and if he wanted to get back together then I would like to as well. This is where our stories could be told differently. I felt as though he still expressed interest in me meanwhile he thinks he never said or implied on getting back together and was unsure of it himself (although in the end we got back together). Anyways one day I decided it was best to officially leave him because I was tired of being sad and wanting him and was officially wanting to move on so the feeling would go away and also he said if I left then maybe he‚Äôll realize what he let go was a mistake. So as I gave my speech that I will no longer want to see him or talk to him I gave him my bracelet he had given me a while back. He began to tear up and I felt guilty because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him but I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs actually hurt. By the end of the day I wanted to apologize and wanted my bracelet at least for memories and I wanted to stay friends so I texted him if I could come over. He said he wasn‚Äôt sure but I was pushy and ended up heading over with permission. Everything seemed off to me. When I arrived he had his car on and seemed to be heading some where. Once he saw me walk to his gate he ran out of his car to meet me and I apologized and told him I‚Äôd like my bracelet back and if I could get it and he said no. Things were off so again I pushed and asked how come? I‚Äôm here and it‚Äôs right there on your counter. I start walking towards his car and front door and he was block me off but I make my way forward and then I look inside his car and there she is. Another girl. I freaked out but I feel as though I handled it as best as I could. I questioned his asking him what the hell is going on and who was she. I felt cheated. I went to ask her who she was and she said a co-worker and I told her please be honest with me and if that was all and she said yea. I always feel like girls should look out for one another so I felt like I could believe it yet I couldn‚Äôt. He walked me to my car and I was constantly questioning him and begging him that this wasn‚Äôt why he left me. He told me no. They just work together and they have been working out together and she doesn‚Äôt drive and had been needing rides. He was very upset with me because he thinks I was following him and that I had no right involving that girl in our situation. Keep in mind this was maybe a week into a break up. I asked him why he didn‚Äôt tell me that and he replied saying because I knew you‚Äôd act like this. The following days weren‚Äôt easy. When we hung out I saw he constantly text him and she was everywhere. She‚Äôd send him funny tweets texts and snaps and just everything. I questioned him one day and he said nothing we are just getting to know each other. That hurt me a lot and again I felt cheated. The next few days pass and I hear from my parents that they saw him with another girl and I realized this is turning into something outside of work and I‚Äôm broken. 

Before we got back together I wanted to clarify what really happened. He said they were really just getting to know each other and they hung out (which consisted of sushi, a cruise around the beach, and two hang outs at local spots at parks that are known for taking people on dates). He told me there were other occasions where the hung out at target, went to work out, got some shaved ice, and a coffee shop where he‚Äôd help her study for to get a certification.  Which is WAY more hanging out and talking than he does with any other female co worker or friend. 

As of now, I still feel somewhat hurt. I still have ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù of how this played out and get very sad. I‚Äôm not sure how to help myself stop thinking of it. However the issue is that he believes that I shouldn‚Äôt be as hurt as i am and is not in the wrong with what he did because we were not together. I feel that he did in some way cheat. Not textbook cheat. I‚Äôm not sure but I feel cheated. What he did was not okay and shouldn‚Äôt be okay. I feel like he owes me a little more effort into make me feel like this won‚Äôt happen again or it was a mistake or at least a big apology. The thing is I can understand in some sense that yes technically we weren‚Äôt together but I still don‚Äôt understand how someone can do that to someone they truly care about. I just want to understand and maybe it‚Äôll maybe help me move on and stop having these ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù. Who‚Äôs right here?

Also as of now he cut off all contact with her outside of work and agreed that any conversation is work only and no exceptions for anything else. He is okay with all this however he mentioned a hypothetical if she asked hi how are you doing and told him I wouldn‚Äôt be okay with him continuing conversation. Although we didn‚Äôt really come up with a conclusion to that, out of my curiosity, is that okay for me to have restrictions on his interactions with her specifically although the is okay with him?",relationship_advice
t3_dljccb,Complicated fianc√© family situation‚Äî advice needed,"So I (F 29) found out tonight that my fianc√©‚Äôs (M 30) family has been leaning on him since he graduated 4 years ago to contribute to their living (i.e. paying rent, food, even co-signing and guaranteeing sibling‚Äôs student loans). It‚Äôs upwards of $50k in things he spent on them and another $20k for his student loan debt, $6.5k interest free credit card debt, $10k as a co-signer for his sister, and another $30k student loan guaranteer. 

It is a mess built over the last 5-10 years as his family struggled after a family business caved. His siblings are in college and grad school but no one is working, parents really only work part time. Their credit is shot and the whole family leeches off of him. I‚Äôm angry and hurt that he kept me in the dark and don‚Äôt know that I trust any of them right now, him included. I asked him before if he was paying for them and he lied over the years that he was not.

We are young professionals in an expensive city with a wedding next year (my parents are paying for, thank God. However I wish I knew of these issues before and would not have planned a big wedding...). I don‚Äôt have debt and max out retirement, have 6 months savings and Roth IRA maxed out. We live together and live pretty frugally except for him bleeding money to his family.

Long story short, I don‚Äôt know how to move forward here. We love each other but I resent the family for putting him/us in this situation and quite frankly sabotaging our financial future. He knows he needs to stop giving handouts and I don‚Äôt trust him, he kept all this from me for years. I only found out when I overheard him talking to his mom and confronted him about it.

I‚Äôm afraid we are in too much of a mess to build a life together and the family is such a financial mess. We were both wanting to go part time to graduate school and save for a house in 5 years. I don‚Äôt see how this is possible especially with possible sibling student loans to deal with. How do we move forward? 

I don‚Äôt know if I should walk away or what. We love each other but he loves his family and I don‚Äôt know that he will actually stop helping even though he told me he knows he needs to. The fact that the financial mess and deceit, lies over the years broke trust I don‚Äôt know what to do.",relationship_advice

t3_dllq5e,My (18f) best friend (17f) is getting incredibly toxic and I cannot find the guts to talk to her.,"So, right now I am sitting in an Art Class that I worked on organizing for a couple of weeks.. But my ""best friend"" completely shut me up and proceeded to use my ideas and plans, refusing to listen to me and playing the "" leader role"".  

Chiara has always been somewhat rude to me, but I always thought it was like that because of my introverted personallity; to me, she just seemed like a person with a lot of energy for talking and being the leader. 

**A bit of a background info,** at my place of study, we can organize extra Creativity sessions outside class. A few months ago, ""Chiara"" and I decided to organize running Art sessions every week.  I am an arts student, she is not, she just wanted to hang out. We were supposed to attend a leadership workshop that teaches students to run activities, plan out sessions and overall have a smooth session. She did not come. So, since I came, I became the official ""runner"" of the activity and my school registered me as the only leader. Chiara thought that the leadership workshop was unnecessary and that she would be happy to be an unofficial leader. I was fine with that, since she did not want to lead anyways. 

I honestly feel like telling her to just shut up and stop talking about my ideas and messing up my sessions, but I also don't want to jeopardize my relationship with her nor the sessions that are compulsary for everyone until the end of the year.",relationship_advice

t3_dlgx41,Boyfriend saying he has been thinking of someone but it doesn't impact his feeling for me?,"Heads up this will be long but I just don't know what to do.

I made a post before about this person. I told him about a month ago that I needed a break from the relationship because of stress and lack of time to contribute to the relationship. Since then he has hardly spoken to me and if he does respond to me it was very short and seemed disinterested. Before me, there was another girl he was semi involved with but when I told him I had feeling for him he said he still had feelings for me. It took him months to break things off with that other girl but when he did we officially got together. Last week he told be that since the break he has had ""this person"" on his mind and it made him feel guilty but that it didn't impact his feelings for me at all. 
He has started asking for photos again and when I comply he says all these sweet validating things to me and it makes me feel good about myself. The thing is I don't feel the way I used to feel about him. Before I would happily hang out with him any chance I got and now I'd rather do things with my friend or do things on my own. He has asked about trying sexual things that relate to a kink he has and although Im not enthusiastic about it (I already told him in not into sex or sexual acts) I have denied him so many things already And I feel like if I don't at least try to do one of the things for him then it's unfair to him. 
I used to enjoy cuddles with him but now it feels just empty. I don't have a fast heart anymore, I don't love the way he constantly tries to kiss me or cover me in kisses or put his face right in mine so I can do the same (which I honestly  just find annoying), I just wait for him to finish initiating affection so I can watch whatever we were watching and the cycle repeats. 

Im confused because I've thought about actually ending the relationship but when he mentioned that he had that other person on his mind a lot, I instantly felt panic and felt upset and like i.was unworthy or a failure And like I just can't lose him. 

I don't know why Im like this or what to do. Every relationship I've been in has ended badly and a friendship couldn't even be maintained after. Im afraid and I don't know why or what to do. Logically I feel like I should definitely break things off but I just keep thinking about why he's good for me and I should just stick it out because relationships are about compromise.

I feel awful and confused and scared  and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like if he has had  that other person on his mind since the break, then that's a sign that I should end the relationship, regardless of whether or not it impact the way he feels about me (he says he still loves me and wants to be with me) but I also feel like it's my fault to begin with.",relationship_advice
t3_dllos2,Can't decide if I want my sister in my wedding,"While I was trying on wedding dresses last weekend, my mom and grandma were both pressuring me to have my sister as my MOH. I told them I didn't want her as my MOH with a few reasons. They think she should because she's my sister. 


Background: My sister (25f) and I (27f) have never been the closest or on the same page about anything. She joined the military at 18 and now lives out on the east coast and I live in the midwest, so we only see each other for holidays with family usually. I have made attempts to see her and invite her to my life events (graduate from college x2, birthday parties, house warming parties) along with my fianc√© trying too (our proposal, my surprise birthday he threw for me). All of these events had invitations sent out at least 6 months in advance, so timing hasn't been an issue. She never even replies yes or no. Yet she finds a way to make it to our 3 year old cousin's birthday party over the summer with a few weeks notice. 


When she invites me to her events, I try my darndest to make it. I made it to her National Guard boot camp graduation during the middle of my spring semester in junior year. I made it to the surprise birthday party she threw for my dad even though I had planned a surprise party for my FMIL that same weekend. Long story short, she told me I didn't love our family and she knew what weekend I planned that party on.


Also, she's been unsupportive of my relationship with my fianc√©. Him and I have been together for over 8 years and he just graduated from pharmacy school. My sister has been so hung up on the cost of school and tells me I shouldn't marry someone with so much debt. She also has been telling my mom that she thinks I'm just too passive to break up with him and she thinks I'm unhappy. Honestly, not sure where it came from or what gave her that impression. Sure, I've talked to her about issues I've had with him in the past, but nothing to make her think I'm stuck or unhappy. 


Recently my fianc√© and I have been planning our wedding and the wedding party came up. He doesn't want her to be a part of the wedding at all because he doubts she'll show up, she won't get along with the other girls, or she will bring her ""service dog"" to the wedding. 



TLDR: family wants my sister as my MOH, I'm considering her to be my bridesmaid, fianc√© doesn't want her in wedding party at all.",relationship_advice
t3_dlquxv,"I [F19] have been thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend [M20] of almost 2 years, but I have no idea what to do:(","I should probably start out by saying that I have depression and anxiety.

We have been dating for almost 2 years now, we met in high school and we are both sophomores in college (the same college). He is my best friend and we have so much fun together. My dad passed away unexpectedly on our 1 year anniversary and he was with me through that. We have been through a lot together, I don‚Äôt know if we are going through a rough patch or if I should call it. Over the summer he found out that his mom has breast cancer, things obviously changed then, but it was still good. He never wants to talk about it and I‚Äôm not sure what else to do so I respect that. He never talks about how he‚Äôs feeling either, not unless I confront him about something that he has been doing or not doing that is bothering me. In the past month it feels like he has been avoiding me. I asked if he wanted to come home with me since he was already in the area and I offered to pick him up and bring us back to school. He said no because he just wanted to go back to school and relax. Our friends were also home from school so I was disappointed. Then Sunday of that weekend came around and he ignored my texts all day until I said goodnight (text) or a bit before that. We live in the same building and usually we would say goodnight to each other in person. He said sorry I was working on music stuff and I have a lot on my mind. The next day he slept in and missed class which was very very unusual for him and I asked if everything was okay and he said yes, I pressed him, but that did not change his answer. Now today everything seemed normal, I asked if he was busy and he didn‚Äôt answer, then I added you can always say no to hanging out. He replied ‚ÄúI was going to crawl in bed and watch videos the rest of the night.‚Äù And I said that‚Äôs okay. He saw it but never answered and i added is there anything you want to talk about. No answer as of 6:54.

t3_dlln4e,I (26M) want to get back together with my ex (20F) but... (Long),"Hi. Apologies in advance for the long post, just want to be thorough.

So my ex and I began dating in December, for about 4 months. It was great, our first few dates were amazing, best I've ever been on. Clicked immediately, instant connection. And continuing to date was so great. We never made things exclusive, but neither of us really felt the desire to see other people. All in all, it was great and we had a lot of fun.

After a while, it started getting to that point where you define the relationship and start saying you're ""together,"" that you're bf and gf, etc. I really liked her and kinda wanted things to go in that direction. I think she did too, but whenever I tried to broach the subject or hint at it, she would brush me off and say she wasn't sure yet. In hindsight, I probably put too much pressure on her and should've gone more with the flow, especially considering her past relationships. I kinda brought it up one night and she got a bit emotional, telling me about some bad experiences she'd had in the past.

A little background on her: her last serious boyfriend, who she was with for two years, was really awful to her. Sounded like it was borderline abusive. On top of that, the guys she briefly dated in between him and me were also jerks. I feel like I should have been more understanding and more willing to work with her hesitance to jump into something and possibly get hurt again. But I think I was also afraid of getting hurt myself, since I really liked her and was worried I wasn't her ""type.""

So, between all that and me finishing up grad school (I think the stress and busyness at the time negatively affected my judgement), I broke things off this past April despite really liking her and wishing things were different. She was understandably upset and I tried to be as kind and sensitive as I could, making sure she was okay before I left her place. She asked why I didn't talk to her about this before (she had a point there) and that now she did want to be my gf (at the time, I interpreted this as her just saying anything to save the relationship) but I still thought it best to end things. She was sad, and so was I, but she seemed to understand.

We met a few days later so I could return something she left at my place, and while it was a little weird and sad to see each other, we parted on really good terms. She said she was glad we met and  thanked me for being good to her while it lasted, and I told her she meant a lot to me and that I'd always be grateful for our time together. Sad, but as far as breakups go, I think we've all had worse.

That was the last time we talked for several months. I stayed in the city and she went back home for the summer, several states away (she's still in undergrad and couldn't stay on campus or find an apartment). We still liked each other's posts on Instagram and social media, but didn't communicate beyond that. 

I spent the summer dating a bit and trying to move on. After a while I stopped, and I noticed all summer that I kept thinking of her and missing her. All the dates I went on never felt right and usually never got past the first date, and never compared to the instant connection I had with my ex. 

Recently I've been really missing her, and a couple weeks ago I decided that maybe I should try and reach out to see how she's doing and if she was still interested in me, but I had to figure out how I wanted to approach it. I wanted to try just being friends at first and make sure that I wasn't just lonely and desperate. That wouldn't be fair to her to jump back in and end up hurting her again if I wasn't sure. But, I figured I'll never know until I try, so I decided to reach out.

Less than 24 hours after making the decision (the timing and irony of this is objectively hilarious, so don't feel bad for laughing), I see an Instagram story of her with a guy (didn't show his face, but it was clearly a date with a guy) and she's posted a couple similar stories since then over the past few weeks. She can't have been seeing this guy that long, based on how long she's been back in the city, and the fact that she's already posting pictures with this guy when it can only have been two months tops, and she only really started doing that with me towards the end... I'll admit that stung.

So I hung back and tried to decide if I wanted to reach out, since I know the timing of this would now look suspicious. I'm suddenly reaching out and want to get back together right after she makes it semi-public that she's seeing someone else? I admit, I'd be skeptical too.

But I decide I should at least try, maybe this guy is just a rebound and it's not that serious. Or maybe it won't work out. 

So two weeks ago, I comment on a Snapchat story she posts and she responds surprisingly quickly, within a few minutes. We text back and forth the rest of the day and we only stop because we need to go to bed. But we catch up and joke around and I say I'm glad we can still talk, I was worried she might ignore me. She says it's all good and no hard feelings. I say we should stay in touch and maybe grab coffee sometime. She's not exactly enthusiastic about that part, but sounds open to it. I've responded to some of her Snapchat and Instagram stories since then, some of which she's responded to or liked, but I haven't brought up making firm plans to meet up yet, since I wanted to give her some space, not come off as too aggressive, and give her time to process.

That brings us up to now. The other day, my friend mentioned he knows a higher up at a pretty well known modeling agency. The higher up says he's always looking for new talent and if my friend knows of anyone, to send them his way. My ex has done some modeling in the past and wants to give it a shot professionally. I thought it might be a good idea to recommend her as something nice to do for her and show her I still care and want to help her out if I can. 

Yesterday, I texted her to see if she's interested in that opportunity. Just asked how she was doing at first, but I was planning to mention it after we exchanged some pleasantries. She hasn't responded so far, but it hasn't even been 24 hours since I texted her and I can see from social media she's got friends visiting town, so she might be busy with them and might have the bandwidth to deal with me. But I am concerned that she might be ignoring me at this point and I might have missed my shot.

So that's where I'm at now. Reddit, how do you think I should proceed? 

I obviously don't want to pester her and ruin things, and I don't want to be that jerk to tries to ruin her relationship with this new guy if it's really good and she's happy with him. But at the same time, I really miss her and I know I'd regret it if I didn't shoot my shot and tell her how I feel. I feel like I should at least try.

TL;DR - Dated my ex for a while, broke up to keep from getting hurt. Realized I might have made a mistake, and want to get back together, but she's dating someone new. What should I do?

Again, sorry for the lengthy post. I hope I don't come off as douchey here. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

I don't even know if she has any interest in me, all I know is that she is Bisexual and she likes the type of body I have.

I'm just so confused and I don't know weather I should talk to her or not. We are not living in the same country, but I am not planning on staying where I am, and she wants to move countries too. She offered me to move in with her if I want to, but is that only friendship or more?

t3_dlqro3,Afraid for the guy I like to find out about my depression,"I‚Äôve had depression for a while now (Persistent Depressive Disorder, so i‚Äôm not suicidal or anything) and most of the people in my life who have found out have ended up drifting away. Because of this, I do my best to hide all of my low feelings when I‚Äôm around my friends. I deal with what I‚Äôm feeling by myself, because that‚Äôs easier than getting rejected again. 

Now I like someone, and he‚Äôs really really nice. I don‚Äôt know how he feels about me, but for the sake of this post, if he did like me, I worry that he would lose interest because of my depression. (I also don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs something that I should keep from him, though, as that would be unfair to him).
I know stuff like this isn‚Äôt exactly attractive, and while I know that I‚Äôm getting better, I still have hard days. 

Of course, I‚Äôm working on myself and I wouldn‚Äôt be expecting him to carry the weight of my depression (I would never ever let that happen) but as of right now, it is still a part of me. Not all of me, but it‚Äôs still there. Anyone have any advice on this how I could feel less afraid of him (or even just people in general) finding out?",relationship_advice
t3_dlnhwr,How to support bf?,"Long story short, my bf (15) and I have been together for nearly a year and have known each other for much longer. (I think) He suffers with (undiagnosed) anxiety because he is always overthinking everything and has major panic attacks. 

I am currently struggling to support him (and I don‚Äôt want to speak to him about it because he has enough on his plate), because his grandfather is very unwell and really doesn‚Äôt have long left, so I am trying to help but my mother is mega protective of me and won‚Äôt let me see him or call him for long enough to really make him feel better. 

On top of all this, he lives with his parents and two older (twin) sisters. His mum has a mild drinking problem and is borderline verbally abusive towards him at the best of times.  His dad really tries but in my opinion he could really do better and sometimes takes out the stress caused by his mum on my bf. One of his sisters (she has asperges I think) is clearly the favourite, and she gets so much attention that he ends up neglected and without new clothes and sometimes denied food, even though it‚Äôs there. 

He knows that what is happening isn‚Äôt acceptable and he hates living there, because we have really important GCSE‚Äôs this year and I help him revise when I can but I‚Äôm at a lose end with what to say. He can‚Äôt come live with me, he can‚Äôt move out or live with his grandparents and his only other family is in Australia (the other side of the bloody planet). 

He is really upset there and i think his mental health is getting worse because of it. I just don‚Äôt know what to do to help, all I‚Äôve been doing is trying to offer support over call and text and making sure that I make sure he knows that he is loved and I am here for him etc, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing enough.

t3_dlqrcv,Dead Bedroom in a Young Relationship,"Throwaway account because he has reddit. 

My boyfriend (26M) and I (21F) have been in a relationship for 9months and live together. We only have sex approx. 3 times a month (about once a week except when I‚Äôm on my period).  This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, only I am the only one who initiates sex. I initiate sex way more than 3 times a month but he turns me down a lot. I can‚Äôt remember the last time he initiated sex. He‚Äôs also not spontaneous at all and we haven‚Äôt had any ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù sex. I‚Äôve talked to him about this at least 5 times now. I‚Äôve told him how I hate that I‚Äôm the only one who ever initiates and it really kills my self esteem when he turns me down so often. I asked him to be honest with me if he doesn‚Äôt enjoy sex with me anymore or If he doesn‚Äôt find me sexually attractive and he assured me that it‚Äôs not that. He makes the excuse that he‚Äôs stressed with work or tired. Every time we‚Äôve talked he said he‚Äôll work on it but he never does.

What confuses me is that he‚Äôs been with 50+ girls and before we started dating we had insane sexual tension. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to have sex with anyone else. everything else in our relationship is great and we love each other a lot. I‚Äôm worried we‚Äôre not sexually compatible. 

Ladies/gentlemen, have you been in this situation? What has helped??

t3_dlnhpb,Once a cheater always a cheater? Or can people change? This seems like a special case that could go either way...,"So I'm in college, my boyfriend and I have been in an amazing relationship for half a year now which doesn't seem like a long time but he is my best friend and treats me amazing and we get along extremely well, he talks about a future with me all the time and has always been trustworthy. We have never had any major issues in the relationship. He doesn't really text other girls, isn't in contact with any of his ex's, has never cheated in past relationships and has been extremely loyal to me our whole relationship...until saturday night. So we got in a small fight and we were both a little drunk after the bars and I childishly left his house and walked back to mine to cool off because I was upset. His house had an after party and this girl that him and I are both acquainted with but neither of us know her well at all was at the party aggressively coming onto him. They had never talked before this point and neither expressed any interest in the other whatsoever before saturday. They were both drunk but not blacked out and they made out and according to everyone at the party, he did not initiate but didnt stop it either. He told me immediately the next day and was so extremely full of guilt, remorse, pain. He was really torn up about it and knows damn well that he fucked up. He told me that if I would consider taking him back, he would stop drinking altogether, i could check his phone every day, delete every girl off his phone, etc. Etc. And that he would do everything he could to make sure nothing like that happened ever again. They didnt have sex, it wasnt pre-meditated, and I can tell he is extremely torn up about it. Should I give him another chance?

EDIT: I don't know if this is important but the other girl knew he had a girlfriend when she aggressively went after him.",relationship_advice

t3_dlngx9,I (19m) was just told by my gf (18f) that she is questioning her sexuality,"I'm sorry for the long post, but I need to talk about this with someone. For context me and my gf have been together for about a year and 3/4 now. I knew she wanted to go out of state for college and decided it would be best to go on a break (was practically a break up) to see how we stand. Two months later we are back together and it's been odd since. She is bisexual which I have no issue with. My problem is that she is a very flirtatious girl by nature, and quite frankly can be immature at times. Immature enough to almost force me to cut ties with a friend of mine. She has also gotten mad at me when I told her I was uncomfortable with listening to a story she was telling (this story involved almost explicit acts with her friends). This is on top of comments that I haven't brought up to her, the most egregious to me being ""Beetlejuice can get some"" in relation to why the new Broadway show is so popular. A month after being together again she tells me that she has been questioning her sexuality. Of course this caught me off guard, but on top of that last Sunday we went out to lunch; during lunch she tells me that she believes she prefers women more. She insists that she is happy with me and that we can stay together as long as it isn't sexual.

Personally I dont mind this at all, I haven't had a sex drive or anything in months, but my problem is that I just want her to be happy. No matter how much she tells me that she is happy, there is something in my gut that tells me she isn't, or that she could be cheating. I care for her immensely and I just want her to be happy, but i also want to make sure I'm at least somewhat happy too. I know she is probably joking about the comments and such, but I feel like I cant talk about them with her because she either takes it to heart, and makes me feel bad, or gets defensive. I've been emotionally distraught for the past few days, and can't play these games anymore.",relationship_advice
t3_dlngwp,"I (21m) developed feelings for a girl (21f), had a weird relationship with her sister (20f) years ago","Okay so this sounds bad but at least hear my story.

So I (21m) left my hometown for the military a few years ago. Really quit talking to anybody from home. I figured I moved on in my life and never expected anything like this to happen. I had gotten back in touch with a girl (21f who I'll refer to as sam) from back whom I've known for quite some time. It started off with just catching up, as people who've known eachother since we were kids.

Months pass and I get the chance to go home, I see her, we have a great time. We're really connecting. I go back and hear I'm going to Germany in a few months. I tell her I'm gonna come see her before I leave and me and her are going to go on a trip. I know the odds of anything working out between us is slim. With the life I want to live. The army has me moving around and once I get out I don't plan on staying in one place either.

I decide I'm going to tell her I feel about her. Fuck it. I hope she feels the same way, if not, I really care for her and I want her in my life as a friend anyway. We get this airbnb in the city, really nice place with a view. We had some fun times and everything went as I hoped. I told her how I felt and she said she felt the same way. We talked about it and decided we would leave things how they were and continue as friends because we didn't want to hold eachother back and the long distance would be hard. I was happy but in a bittersweet way. It's been years since I've been with anyone. I miss it, honestly.

I go home and we keep in touch, we grow closer each day and we decide we're just going to stop holding back with our feelings for eachother, but if either of us had anything going on with anyone else, we would talk about it and decide what we want to do, a casual thing I guess, I didnt mind.

At this point I'm deep in my feelings for her. I want to be with her so bad, I've talked to all my friends and they say we should be together and just do long distance. ""What's stopping you?"" They say.

A few things. When I was 18 I was talking to her sister (18 at the time, who I will refer to as abbey), and we talked off and on as friends, and at one point we had discussed having a friends with benefits type relationship. What's funny is that nothing physical actually came of it, we just kinda dropped it. I did see her tits though through messages though.

That was years ago. I don't care about abbey and I never thought I would developed this relationship with sam. It eats at my conscious. I'm sure if sam heard about this from her sister she probably wouldn't want to be with me, and I wouldn't blame her, its dishonest and shitty. But there was never a definitively correct time to say anything. I already have a deep emotional (although unofficial) relationship with sam, and I don't know how to go about this.

I could ramble about this and all the little conversations I've had with my friends. Or the things me and Sam have said to eachother.

t3_dlnfz9,I [19F] is becoming terrified of my [21M] boyfriend who I do love,"
I‚Äôm on a throwaway because he has my main reddit account. I‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôm advance if this is everywhere. I‚Äôve known him for 4 years, and we were ‚Äúsuppose to be together‚Äù when we met, but I didn‚Äôt feel like he was ready and I had fallen in love with a boy. Flash back years later, we always stayed in contact. I moved to Florida and had another relationship and he did as well. Those both ended around the same time. Not planned. I visit back home and after some time thinking, I thought maybe it was time to see him. (We play video games) that‚Äôs how we always kept in contact. 

My first visit I told him I just wanted to reconnect and not have sex, were very open so it wasn‚Äôt a problem. From my understanding at least. We saw eachother and got drunk and talked and he started wanting to have sex but I didn‚Äôt. After almost an hour of begging it happened. And you won‚Äôt believe what he did. Called me his ex during sex. I‚Äôm
sure it happens to people but I just was annoyed. I didn‚Äôt wanna even have sex. He said it meant nothing and he was drunk. I just ignored it. I spent my last 4 days with him. 2nd day in he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. 

I went back to florida for a 3 weeks. He begged me to take a month off of school to come see him. Constantly. I just switched my math class to online for the month and bought my plane ticket the same day. Keep this in mind. 
I do everything he asks. I share both of my locations. The 360 app. Read receipts on, although I personally don‚Äôt care. If he doesn‚Äôt like somebody I don‚Äôt hangout with them. I text him back on time. I went back and I was going to be with him for a whole month. I was terrified, but why? that‚Äôs my boyfriend. I shouldn‚Äôt feel this extreme anxiety. Him telling me what to do all the time was starting to make me feel like I was walking on eggshells. 

I‚Äôm at his house now. 
He wants sex 5 times a day. Not saying that‚Äôs bad but I personally can‚Äôt handle that. Sometimes I just want a small break. It‚Äôs not normal sex it‚Äôs very rough and I can get very tired. Saying No to him has become a bad decision on my part. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. My bestfriend and Him hate eachother. I can‚Äôt hangout with anyone down here that I use to know. I can‚Äôt wear shorts to his friends house. Anytime we‚Äôre out he belittles me. My boyfriend is so fucking mean it hurts. He says things that are awful. He‚Äôs suppose to be my bestfriend, and I feel like an empty object. He can get rough sometimes. The most he‚Äôs done is slap me but I‚Äôve always returned the favor, never punch or hit me. I was sleeping and he wanted me to get up, and he just grabbed my legs and flew them to him, and grabbed my chest and then my throat to lift me up. I was so surprised I just kicked him in the stomach. My blood sugar has been low lately so I‚Äôve been tired. After days I started not eating, and just sitting in his bed, wanting to cry but nothing would come out. Then when I needed to cry I‚Äôd go to the shower. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable seeing him watch me cry. I knew he‚Äôd just stare

I ended up packing some stuff up and after telling him that he‚Äôs just being really mean, I went to stay at my friends house. Next morning I come to get the rest of my stuff. He‚Äôs smiling and laying down which is already terrifying. I asked him if he knew where my make up bag was and he said, ‚Äúno.‚Äù So I asked if he could help me look for it, and he said, ‚ÄúI like watching you.‚Äù 

I begin to get upset because he compared himself to the joker and I just didn‚Äôt feel like any of this was funny. I had spent money to see him. I trusted him. 

He expressed that since I want him to work on being nice, I need to work on something too. 
My heart dropped,...but I was ready because I love him and sometimes it‚Äôs not always the other persons fault. ‚ÄúYou need to be more submissive‚Äù I was so confused because I already felt like he controls everything I do. He told me that the arguing and back talk needs to stop. That I can‚Äôt be saying no all the time. 

I really felt sad. I went to lay down, we ended up falling asleep before he had work. we woke up a couple of hours later and he wanted to have sex he said, ‚ÄúThis is how you could work on that new submissive thing we talked about‚Äù but i‚Äôm on my period and just woke up and was sleepy. I hadn‚Äôt been feeling good and he knows that. Picks me up, takes me to the bathroom to remove the tampon. I did. I did. 

He finished and got off me and I felt empty. Just the same empty feeling. I couldn‚Äôt believe this is how he was towards me. He‚Äôs been obsessed with me for years and I‚Äôve always really loved him. but this side is different. It‚Äôs cold. I‚Äôm deep in this. I leave sunday back home. I have to make a decision fast.

t3_dlqp41,My(f25) boyfriend (m26) won‚Äôt let it die that I hooked up with my ex a few days before I met him. Was I wrong for not telling him?,"I get tired of this community going straight to ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù, so try to elaborate if you really think that is the best idea. 
I literally have no idea what to think about this. Is it his problem or mine, I really don‚Äôt know. 
So, I was in what became a super abusive relationship from 2016-2018 where I was thrown to the ground and threatened to be murdered (that was just the biggest craziest thing that happened but there was so much crazy shit. (Before that, I was in a physically absuive marriage where I was given a concussion.) 
I met my boyfriend at end of February in 2019. Wow we fell in love fast, because we both realized we were each others type down to the T.
It was very interesting being with someone patient and talked about not speaking out of anger to each other and stuff. So refreshing and made me fall in love quick. 
Fast forward to like end of March. I never thought to delete my messages because why would he go through my phone? Just didn‚Äôt come to me because I was so enamored and on cloud nine.  He went through my ex boyfriends messages all the way back to 2015( we were friends before we dated end of 2015) on every social media platform (fb, text now, instagram, google hangouts, email...) 
He was DEVASTATED because my relationship with my ex was very passionate (we were ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù about each other, but we fought so bad (he had borderline personality disorder so that majorly contributed) and I broke up with him often but would always return. I came to the conclusion I was sick. I can‚Äôt explain it. My mom SEVERELY abused me for like 5 years and I feel like it did irreparable damage. I would break
Up with him in fear bc he was so controlling etc etc but would always return. Some people got mad at me, eventually everyone in my life left out of sheer exhaustion and it was all pretty traumatizing. 
To my chagrin and HUGE embarrassment, I spent like five days entertaining my ex (I gave him a blow job at the beginning of the few days) at beginning of February BEFORE I met my now boyfriend. I broke it off like a few days before I met my now boyfriend in person. I‚Äôm disgusted and I kind of looked at it as a ‚Äúrelapse.‚Äù 
Though I‚Äôve tried to explain it to my boyfriend REPEATEDLY, he cannot gain peace over it. He feels like a pawn, a stepping stone, a rebound. I tried to explain to him that I didn‚Äôt have feelings for him anymore and was acting out of impulse to return to a really bad habit. In 2017, I did love him, but by feb of 2019, I didn‚Äôt anymore, I spent ample time alone and had really been scared senseless from things he had done physically like hold me on the floor by my throat. However, I would have ‚Äúrelapses‚Äù where something sick in me would go to him and be with him. 
My boyfriend comes from a village in Kenya. He doesn‚Äôt understand why America talks so much of mental illness and he has no reference for anything I am saying to him so he just feels like I loved him even right before I met him, and used him to get over him. I fell in love with him because my heart was ready. 
It has been a huge point of contention and drama in our relationship. He‚Äôs so mad at me for entertaining him and ‚Äúusing‚Äù him and brings it up a lot. He says he feels manipulated. I thought I could put the past behind me and wanted to bury it far far out of my mind so I didn‚Äôt bring it up. I wanted my new chapter to be free of any of the pain of that disgusting relationship. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the wrong for dating him and not saying anything. but I am being honest on my perspective that I didn‚Äôt love the ex anymore. Is he crazy for going through four years of messages and wrong for making  assumptions or am I wrong for ‚Äúmanipulating?‚Äù",relationship_advice
t3_dlhp99,Given an Ultimatum.. HELP,"Basically over the weekend, I and my friends went and smoked and had some fun. I have never smoked before (weed) and I wanted to try it so I took a couple of hits. My(23M) girlfriend (23F) and I have been dating for 3 years and she is very anti-weed, she saw a snapchat of the blunt asked me if I smoked and I lied and said no but I eventually my guilt got the best of me and I told her the truth, and then she broke up with me. However a couple of hours later we talk and she is very rude and not loving at all, constantly putting me down and all that sort of stuff which is understandable as I swore that I didn't smoke even though I did. Then she gives me an ultimatum of either choosing my friend group, one of my best friends, and a cousin or choosing her. If I chose her, I would have to block all of them. She also wants me to block them from all social media and lose all contact. She has my accounts and all my passwords and she constantly checks my phone. In the moment I chose her, but after thinking about it, I think its a bit much and controlling of her to control my social media, who I'm friends with, making me choose between my cousin who has nothing to do with the scenario. All because I lied one night about not smoking. None of my friends are girls, they are all guys who I met at high school. We have also had the talk about smoking which she is very against and that's as to why she broke up with me. Is she being too controlling? Did I go too far?

t3_dlnevg,"How can I(F26) navigate a friendship with my ex(M28) who, in my opinion, has a drinking problem while he doesn't think he has a problem and does nothing to change his drinking habits?","I broke up with my ex about five months ago due to his unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It wasn't just me who thought he had a drinking problem either. My friends, coworkers and family members (and even his family members) were all concerned about his drinking, so I know it's not just me being hypercritical. 

When we broke up, he told me that he knew he had a problem and that if I took him back, he'd give up drinking, but after a year of running myself ragged, I was at the end of my rope at that point and wasn't willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

We went a few months without contact, and although I missed his friendship and companionship, I knew it was what was for the best for me. Deep down I figured he was probably still out there drinking himself silly every chance he got, but it wasn't my problem anymore. 

Last month a natural disaster put us back in contact. He was literally one of the first people I thought about when disaster struck and I wanted to know he was okay. Ever since then, we've been in contact and he has told me that he knows a relationship will probably never be on the table ever again but he'd like to be friends if it's what I wanted. And I do. I love having my friend back even if it's not my ""boyfriend"" but I'm having a hard time disconnecting from being that concerned girlfriend. 

He has told me that he does not actually think he has a drinking problem and that he was just telling me what he thought I wanted to hear in order to keep the relationship alive. He's entitled to feel that way just as I'm entitled to feel the way I do. If he honestly believes he has a healthy relationship with alcohol, fine, it's his life and he can live it how he wants, but when we hangout together and his drinking starts getting out of hand (as it always does) it's so hard for me to turn a blind eye and not care. I *do* care about his drinking and I feel like his excessive binge drinking holds him back from achieving his goals, but if he doesn't see that, who am I to force it on him? Just because I'm no longer the girlfriend doesn't mean I don't care about him anymore. Sure, his drinking no longer directly affects me or my happiness but I'm having a hard time keeping my concerns in the friend zone.",relationship_advice

t3_dlqnlr,"I discovered my(26M) girlfriend(26F) was EXTRAORDINARILY in love with the guy she dated after we had broken up, while she never truly expressed love to me before the bkup.","Hello, our gf and I are very happy right now, things are going great, after 10 years of knowing each other and several relationships we've been in, we are very solid and everything looks promising. This is not a sad love story, and I don't plan on having problems with her regarding this matter, since I think it's very understandable. My main objective is asking for advice for feeling better and not being a little immature boi about her past partners.

So, very straightforward. We've been friends for 10 years, I've been in love with her for some years now, and a couple of years ago I decided to confess, and we gave it a try. We were in a relationship for about 8 months. It didn't work out, though. During this time my love was very one-sided. She was battling depression and had a very stressful and taxing job, and I couldn't handle her lack of commitment, and she couldn't handle my lack of understanding and patience. We were almost toxic and we broke up, with maturity but also a bitter taste. 

About 6 months after the breakup, I had not dated anyone, and she dated one guy from work, he basically was her rebound, and I was almost sure it would happen because she kept looking for shelter on him when we were having problems at the end. We had broke up, though, she can be with whom she wants. Anyway, turns out he was a narcissist and her dealing with depression were a deadly combination. At the climax of their story, it was me who she looked for for advice during a panic attack. We had been 6 months separated, so I got to listen to a lot of out-of-context POV of her story. While we were talking, she always reffered to the guy as ""this person"", not mentioning if they were together, their gender, their actions. She only kept saying things like ""this person has hurt me a lot"". I understood and assumed he was talking about THE guy. Anyway, I sincerely and with all my heart advised she cut him off completely, and she did. And we spent another 6 months with no contact whatsoever.

Then we coincidentally ended up at the same watercolor classes, and started spending more time together. She was looking fresh and amazing after working on herself for some months now (same thing for me). We started dating and after for months got serious about our relationship. Then she told me she had to get off her chest that she actually dated a guy while we broke up, but it means nothing now and wants to stay with me, that she found out she actually loved me but it took some hits to realize. I told her I already knew, and I honestly didn't care, since she's here for me now, right?

We've been solid and gone through hardships we've battled together. We are a good couple and we love each other.

Then a couple of days ago I decided to give tumblr a try (lol) and created an account. I looked for her profile to follow her, which I knew the name of, but haven't seen it before, since tumblr asks for an account in order to look at profiles. At this point I was stalking her lol but in a good way, it was cool to look at her reblogged animal pictures and paintings. And I got really happy as I scrolled down and started finding love posts for me and that kind of stuff. Then I got to the point before we started dating this time, and it was overflowed with sad and angry love posts. I started panicking a bit, and egoistically I started reading some of them. I felt a little bit guilty, because turns out she was using tumblr as a (very shallow) diary. 

Then it hit me when I started looking at posts with the biggest love and loving words anyone can muster. Calling him magical, calling him the best decision she has even taken, talking about stars aligning for them to be together. And that would be okay for me, but it broke my heart a little, considering these posts were happening like a month after we broke up, and considering I was never really special to her the first time we dated.

I felt very inferior to him, she basically upgraded her feelings and her partner to a better version. And I found out they were in a serious relationship, not only FWB, they were planning about marriage and traveling.

And I felt sad, very sad. I know our love right now is real. She feels now EXTRAORDINARILY in love with me too. I can tell, she tells me that, I feel it, and we both love each other, and we now talk about our dreams together and marriage. But before that guy, I was only a guy she only liked, and I was replaced with someone who she felt a real connection. I just happened to be there after they broke up and she fell for me again.

So I don't know what should I feel. This is not something I would argue with her about. She never lied to me about him. And I really never asked for details. What I knew was that she dated someone and now he means nothing. It never ocurred to me how BIG he was in her love life, and I feel a bit inferior now. Like I'm the rebound, perhaps.

We have been together for more than a year now, and we are veeeeery, incredibly happy. She makes sure to prove it to me everyday and I do the same for her. But now I can't brush this inferior feeling off.

I feel kind of betrayed, but I was never betrayed, you know? She can date and love whoever she wants while she is single. Basically I just understood they had a shallow (almost friend-ish) relationship, but I found out they were dead serious.

What do you think is the correct action for me to do? Apart of growing the hell up, of course.

I have no intention of having a fight over this. Of course I can talk my insecurities with her, but I guess the main point of this is my insecurities, and that is something I have to work on myself, because she already helps me with them, remembering to nurture and love me everyday.

Thank you for your time.

TLDR: My gf and I broke up once (and are currently together). I know she dated a guy for 6 months after we broke up, and she told me he means nothing to her anymore, I understood and left it as that. Recently I found out she loved him greatly. They even planned on getting married. But when we were together the first time she didn't even told me she loved me, and she always said things like ""if I ever get married, I want to..."" instead of including me in the plan. And even if right now she wants to spend the rest of her life with me, it hurt my feelings/pride knowing she loved a random guy x10 times more than me immediately after our breakup.",relationship_advice
t3_dllenz,Are these red flags or am I too sensitive?,"Throwaway because my SO knows my reddit. 

So my Significant Other we will call Sydney(35) and I(35) have been together for about 2 years, coming up on our 1 year exclusive anniversary.  Close friends before. I've known Sydney for a long time, even was a good friend while Sydney's marriage fell apart (they were dead bedroom). 

Things got serious between us and Sydney started talking marriage. Even proposed! Then took the proposal back because of how it was affecting Sydney's custody situation, which I understood completely at the time. 

Then we decided to move in together, but I wanted to be engaged first. I have been cheated on in the past, and my last two relationships were both abusive. I wanted a firmly, publically committed relationship before moving in and pooling financial resources (and surrendering my independence). Sydney agreed and we started planning for both the engagement and move. Day of the move, Sydney proposes. It was sweet and rushed, but very caring and considerate. Heart-felt. I say yes.

We move in, all is good, then Sydney's ex pulls a stunt about custody again, dragging us back in to court. We had decided to tell most people about our engagement after our housewarming party, which wasn't scheduled for another month to let us paint and stuff, but we had started to tell close friends like my BF and my mother. Well, Sydney's lawyer tells Sydney it'll look better if we are not engaged in court.... and Sydney and I had already been having some issues as Sydney was continuing to put off telling people which was making me feel like Sydney was ashamed of me. So Sydney takes back my ring.

Now I am hurt. Crushed. I don't think this is at all fair. While Sydney shows me every day how much I am loved in little ways, like sweet texts, kisses, and making time for me, Sydney is big on saying things like how we need to be ""on the same team"". But when it is actually a situation where we are on the ""same team"", Sydney leaves me behind, doesn't tell me about it, or entirely avoids mentioning I even exist. Most of Sydney's friends don't even know I exist. Sydney writes this off to ""being a very private person"". But where is the boundary between being private and ignoring my existence?

Help, Reddit. I know I have some baggage (in therapy and working on it) because of my previous relationships..... but is this baggage or red flags?",relationship_advice
t3_dlncv0,Is this love? And what on earth do I do about it?,"I'm 17 and a half (F) and I think I'm in love. I just don't know what type. I was walking home one afternoon and it just hit me that I was in love, I can't explain it. He's one of my best friends (16) and I've known him a long time. The only thing is, I never really saw him like that until now. It was a mutual thing that we had that we didn't have romantic feelings for each other, and we always said the idea of that with each other was gross. He would always joke that I had a crush on him, which i threw back at him and denied, and at the time it was true. I honestly told him I would rate him a 6/10 on looks but for some odd reason now I find him attractive. What made me realise my love is probably him getting a girlfriend that he actually likes, and has the same name as me. My head jumped to thinking of the two of them getting married and loving together and it just makes me so upset. We always planned that we would live together when we were older and have kids artificially, as we didn't want sex with each other. We used to talk all the time but he hasn't reached out to me in weeks because he's always busy now (at his girlfriend's house). Should I let him know how I feel?

t3_dlqm74,Fiance and Friend,"Hi Reddit,

Looking for some advice. This is a throwaway.

My fianc√© broke our engagement last winter. We had been together nearly ten years, and the last two years I had grown suspicious of her cheating on me. It was a mix of flirting, mild IG thirst traps, and a nonchalant ""IDGAF"" demeanor about my concerns. I blew up about it, and she ended the relationship. I found out right after the relationship ended that she had (at least) a one-night stand with one of my then-close friends. Neither party decided to tell me, and I was told from a friend who is largely removed from our social circle here, which makes me wonder how many people knew. She denied anything happening at first, and finally admitted to the infidelity.

I went ghost and we spent two months apart. We decided to meet back up after she continued reaching out to make things right. I agreed. She seemed to feel badly, but continued to lie and deny that she had ever done something wrong with my friend or anyone else. It was a blur of emotion, and we ended up talking more and more until we were hanging out regularly again.

By the time our engagement was back on, it took about two months to admit what happened with my friend, and also another instance while we were apart. Although I don't hold the second part against her because we weren't together, I wished she had told me and more-so wish she hadn't lied about being with someone else in the breakup phase.

It's now been six months after we've gotten back together. The dust has settled and now I am taking a more logical view of things. The issue I am having is that we resumed our relationship based on falsehood (i.e she never had a one night stand, never hooked up with anyone else, etc.) Now that she has slowly unveiled more facts, I am left to question whether I have the full picture even now. I am afraid there is more she hasn't told me. But my greater fear isn't what actually happened, it's that she learns how to get away with infidelity and I am left feeling like a fool the second time, when the stakes are higher (kids, house, age)...

TL;DR: Fiance cheated and lied about it with one of my friends. We got back together based on her telling me it never happened. Now truth surfaces and there are more revelations than before, and I wonder if I can move past it or if I should move on.",relationship_advice

t3_dllbtm,Chatted with a married man I met on Reddit.,"I'm (F27) struggling to cope with my decision. I sought out attention, and I guess a way to deal with my daddy issues. I went on a NSFW subreddit specifically for men over 35 who are single, married and every other relationship status who are into younger women/men. I found someone I liked and started chatting with him (M44). Everything about it was sexual. But it later got to me because he kept reminding me he was married and had kids, and I was getting attached simply because he was giving me attention. I finally told my best friend and that same night I deleted everything. I have no desire and now know that I don't want that attention. I looked at this guy's profile and he's been doing this for years and has done the chatting thing with multiple girls. I told another friend and she did not hold back from telling me how disgusted she was with me. I'm really struggling to move past this. I never imagined I would seek out attention in this way. She really kicked me when I was down - I guess well deserved. But now I went back to my old ways of coping, self-harming. Now I'm suicidal and just really really hate myself. How do I get grow from this? How do I use her words in my healing process? How do I mend my relationship with her? Myself? And my future partner? I know what I did was wrong. But I really want to grow and heal, so i don't do anything like this again.

UPDATE:

I just wanted to clarify this subreddit that I looked into was NSFW. I did it with the intention of getting attention from an older man, and I found that this subreddit was for older guys who were into younger girls. It doesn't make the situation any better, and I know the guy is going to continue to do it, and he made it clear that his intention was just to get off. But I honeslty didn't care, I just wanted attention. After finding out he was married and had kids, for a moment, I felt bad. But I'm not going to lie, I talked to him for a few days because he was on the subreddit for years, so he knew what he was doing - that made me sleep at night. But after talking with my friend, it was a new perspective, and I realized that this is not me. I don't want that kind of attention or anything like that.

The friends I reached out to don't want anything to do with me so that's rough.

I also made a counseling appointment for this Saturday. I hesitated with counseling because I have only had bad experiences.

Thank you so much for your responses. This is a new chapter, and I hope to heal. Thank you all.

t3_dlqk35,Relationship Advice,"Hi all

I am posting this anonymously on behalf of myself.

I have been with my partner for nearly ten years now and we have two kids (1 &amp; 4). However, since the 1 year old has been born it feels as if our relationship is not the way it used to be. We now argue on a daily basis about anything and everything and I also look at other girls all the time. Also as the years have drifted by we don't have hardly anything in common anymore. I'm thinking about leaving her but I'm not sure. I just keep thinking I don't want my life to be like this anymore. Sleep. Work. Argue. Over and over. 

So last week I sent a message to one of my old flames from eight years ago who I saw for three months. We did more than just hand holding so I still do have slight feelings for her in the back of my brain. And I have really enjoyed talking to her and I smile every time her name pops up on my phone. And we have so much in common than I do with my partner! I now keep thinking about my old flame daily. Eight years ago me and my partner split up for three months. And I started seeing this girl and I said I was developing feelings for her. Then my partner said she wanted me back and we have been together ever since. 

My question is to you guys is if you were in my shoes...what would you do? Would you stay with your partner or leave her. Because I feel like I have tried so many times to make it work but feel as if I am running out of energy to bother anymore. 

Any advice would be much appreciated

t3_dlqjup,Breakup but everything‚Äôs the same?!,"So last week my boyfriend broke up with me. We were both very hurt. He did it because he can‚Äôt see a future with me (from things like starting to get annoyed about little things, and fights from the past, different ways to show love). We still love each other, but because he wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted a relationship he ended it so that he doesn‚Äôt drag me along in the meantime. 

But the thing is, we live together, and everything has been relatively normal. I‚Äôve spoken to him, and he reckons he‚Äôs happy to be roommates, keep sharing a bed, and we did still have sex. 
But I think this might push him away more if I give him everything without the commitment of a relationship. 

The problem is that this place is my home. There‚Äôs no rentals, and I‚Äôm concerned with moving in with roommates. 

Should I just wing it anyway and leave? Or take over the spare room and try to distance myself from my ex? No contact might be a good idea for a little bit so that we can both think, but I don‚Äôt want to leave my home with such a great chance I won‚Äôt ever be back.

t3_dlqjeg,I (F28) can‚Äôt get over my husband‚Äôs (32M) sister (27F) who passed away two years ago.,"Sorry if this gets long. For some background:

My husband, Jackson, and I have been together for 6 years. He‚Äôs a good husband. However, his sister, Jade, was full of light. Beautiful, ambitious, kind, sensitive, stubborn, and loud. When Jackson introduced me to his family, I was all nerves, but it‚Äôs like when I got to know Jade I just melted.

Obviously, I never pursued anything with her. For one, I get that there‚Äôs no way to break up with someone, get with their sibling, and there not be tension for the rest of time. Second, I was and am in love with Jackson. Finally, I was brought up that having that sort of attraction is wrong. I don‚Äôt agree much anymore, but there‚Äôs a part of me that still feels that guilt.

I‚Äôm not sure what Jade‚Äôs sexuality was since her family is very conservative. Jackson and her both joked about all of the things they ‚Äújust don‚Äôt talk about.‚Äù We definitely flirted in small ways, though. And there was confirmation of the mutual feelings the Thanksgiving before her death when some of us had had too much to drink. I ended up in the guest bathroom, and when I came out, Jade was waiting to use it. The hallway to the bathroom is kind of narrow, and I brushed up against her. She grabbed me, and I initiated a kiss. I immediately felt awful and made Jackson, our son (James), and I go not long after.

Since the kiss, I tried to avoid Jade, to the point of her asking Jackson if I was angry at her. Even then, I brushed it off and just wanted to go about my business with my husband and James. Just thinking of Jade hurt too much and felt too confusing.

The December after our kiss, Jade went on a road trip with some of her old classmates to ski. On the way back, a driver running a red light hit their car. Jade and one other passenger died.

Since then, I can‚Äôt get her out of my mind. It‚Äôs like I wake up every morning with this intense love and longing for her that I‚Äôve never even come close to feeling for Jackson. Within the past few months it‚Äôs been affecting my sleep, my work, my sex life with Jackson, and probably a lot of other things. And I still have this horrible guilt because even when I was trying to ignore Jade, this evil part of me looked forward to seeing her in person again, sharing our secret, taking it further. It‚Äôs like I could try to ignore those thoughts, but I still knew they existed.

I‚Äôm so lost right now. I have no idea how to move on.

TL;DR I‚Äôm still in love with my husband‚Äôs sister, Jade, who passed away two years ago. I don‚Äôt know how to move on or handle my feelings.",relationship_advice

As far as I am concerned, I pretty much didn't think twice at all even if something about her past did come up (a conversation, or something random on FB etc). I even just ignored stuff that would ordinarily bother me. However, there were a few instances recently when I repeatedly saw her previous searches about her ex. and one day a FB chat popped up. I was annoyed and obviously asked and she said they had been talking as he was starting something new with his career and that she didn't want to tell me because she thought I wouldn't want to know. Obviously I don't care for any details but I would have liked some sense of openness about this. Somehow that has got me all bothered and it's really influencing my thoughts now. I am completely different from what I was before this happened. Stuff like names in the friend box on FB or top chats in the sidebar are making me very worked up. 

We both had recently come out of relationships before meeting each other and a far as I am concerned , I have cut almost all forms of contact with my ex. Virtually non existent. I prefer it that way because I really believe 'out if sight out of mind'

So, my ex (34M) and I (25F) have been broken up for a few months now. Still co-habiting with some other folks, so see each other every day. We have our own bedrooms, so that‚Äôs not an issue. There has been some tension, but we stay friendly and go about our days.

His best friend, (34M) of about 20 years (I‚Äôll call him Eric) had a clear crush on me, before my ex and I even got together, while we were still ‚Äújust friends‚Äù. Nothing I said/did could dissuade Eric, to the point where I had even asked my ex to have a word. And then my ex (I‚Äôll call him Tom) and I started dating. Eric cooled off but it was clearly awkward. Then obviously Tom and I broke up and here I am.

About once a week recently he‚Äôll stop by and stay overnight with Tom and he‚Äôs always been friendly but now he‚Äôs being overtly flirtatious towards me, right in front of Tom. We‚Äôll be standing in the kitchen and Eric will try to put his arm around me, whilst talking to Tom, or he‚Äôll sit as close to me as possible and try to whisper to me, whilst Tom is sat right across from us.

It‚Äôs obviously tense and it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm not interested, and that it‚Äôs awkward for Tom too but? Not only to chase after your Best Friend‚Äôs Ex, but someone that he shares a wall with, too? Seems like a real dick move and I‚Äôm genuinely shocked at the audacity of it.

I just don‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôve told him before that I‚Äôm not interested but it never fazes him. I don‚Äôt know whether to bring it up with Tom? As Eric‚Äôs only in the house when he‚Äôs visiting Tom anyway, and it seems like they could use a discussion on boundaries and respect.

Sorry, I‚Äôm very anxious about this, living with Tom was hard enough already and I was just about making it work and now it seems like Eric is intent on messing it all up again ;(

So i'd just like to apologise to begin with, i've not dated properly in a few years now, having been in a long term relationship I needed a bit of time to feel ready. So please forgive my naivety - and with that - i'll begin.

So i've known this girl's sister for many years, and we'd flirted a few times on Instagram, and about 3.5 weeks ago I asked her out. The date went amazingly, we both really hit it off, we ended up back at mine and begun texting everyday since. We've been on about 5-6 dates now, some planned &amp; some spur of the moment kind of things, the whole time we've been texting everyday.

The last date, I met her friends, something she said she'd never really done with a guy before, we both affirmed that we liked each other, and I spent the night at hers - we've both got articles of clothing at each others houses now as well, and it seems like she has been telling her friends about me.

However, on Sunday, she cancelled our plans because she was feeling really stressed out about work the next day, I understood and was accommodating. Her texts after that became a bit more distant and slower. The next day she had an incredibly stressful day at work by the sounds of it, and that's all we spoke about when she had time. She did call me though to have a chat about our days briefly, when I asked her if she wanted to hang this week though she said she was quite busy but maybe her friend would cancel on Saturday. The texts after that seemed disinterested.

Today, I left things for a while as I didn't want to crowd her, but when I did text, and she asked me how my day was, she hasn't replied to my response that I was having a bit of a shitty day. It's been 8 hours now, and she's been online a few times, so I can assume that she knows I messaged.

Ultimately I just need some advice on whether this seems like she is losing interest now, or is this something that happens occasionally? Should I cool it off for a while and wait for her to message me, I just want to know what my best play here is as I do like her, and don't wanna mess this up.

t3_dln34v,Should I do my colleague‚Äôs work for her?,"I‚Äôve been working in a small charter school program that is part of a state college for 7 years. So small that there‚Äôs only 1 other English teachers besides me. The college requires that that every new adjunct have a ‚Äúmentor‚Äù, so naturally 7 years ago when I started, the other English teacher was mine. It was my first time teaching any college course, so I was a little lost as to what to do in the beginning. By way of help, my mentor sent me a copy of her syllabus, but that‚Äôs pretty much all I got in terms of mentoring‚ÄîI figured everything out on my own. Which I actually prefer. It‚Äôs academia, and I love that I have the latitude to teach what I want the way I want. 

This other instructor and I have a really nice working relationship, but there‚Äôs always (at least to me) an underlying level of competition between us. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unhealthy, because we are both highly effective and rated highly by administrators and students. That said, we have very different approaches to teaching and life, quite frankly. I don‚Äôt necessarily think either one of us is better than the other per se, but there are things she does I wouldn‚Äôt do (and I‚Äôm sure the reverse is also true). What‚Äôs relevant here is that she prides herself in being the ‚Äúgrown up nerd‚Äù. She plays D&amp;D and WoW, she is a Harry Potter and Dr. Who fan girl and has fandom paraphernalia all over her classroom. There is no shade in making this comment‚ÄîI really love this about her. Whereas I describe myself as ‚Äúnerd lite‚Äù. I have my own fandoms (I have a ‚Äúlife size‚Äù cardboard cutout of Yoda in my classroom for example), but I‚Äôm not as deep in fandoms for a variety of reasons that aren‚Äôt relevant. She also prides herself in being a creative‚Äîwhich she totally is. She draws, plays instruments, and most notably, she writes novels (I‚Äôve read a couple, and they‚Äôre really good). Matter of fact, she spends a lot of her down time in her office working on her novels. 

Fast forward. I was assigned another college-level class 3 years ago which I have also been teaching. My mentor has never taught this course. I created the course from scratch, spent an entire summer doing research and creating everything from the ground up, and I‚Äôve been honing and refining it for 3 years. I‚Äôm really proud of what I have. It‚Äôs my favorite class to teach. The students really really like it, too. 

I chose to base my class around something from nerd culture. Again, I enjoy a lot of things from the culture, but being identified as a nerd is not the main part of my identity like it is for her. 

This year, my colleague has been assigned this course for the first time. I sent her my syllabus, but she has been haranguing me to meet with her and to basically hand over everything that I have curated over the years for my course. 

Besides the fact that I just don‚Äôt have the time to meet (which she knows), it is currently mid-October. She has known she would be teaching this class, which starts in January, since April 2019. Based on what she told me about her summer, I don‚Äôt think she was too busy to prepare for this upcoming class. Furthermore, she can teach anything she wants.

I really don‚Äôt want to hand over my stuff, but we are work-friends, she‚Äôs my classroom neighbor, and it‚Äôs a very small school so I cannot avoid her. Should I just hand it all over?

t3_dlqebi,How to behave?,"So, I have been talking to a girl for the past month and we work together. Im kinda flirting with her on work and got her number. As I said we have been talking a lot and an hour ago we were chatting and the conversation took a weird turn. In all the previous chats I had with her she was flirting with me as well. But this time she started talking about a guy that has been hitting her up on snapchat and that he said that his whole sportsteam liked her etc. 
After that she said that she brushed him off by saying that she got a boyfriend. So I guessed that she made a joke so I said ""nice bluff"". Then she said that she wasn't joking and that she has had a boyfriend since September. Following on that she said that she didn't know why she didn't tell me earlier. After that I ended the conversation quickly because I was suprised and done. But she was very vague about her boyfriend and because of that I assume that she is lying. Im seeing her on work in 2 days so my question is. How do I behave against her? Because I think that it is a test to see if I like her or not. 

TLDR: Girl I talked a lot with said she has a boyfriend and she didn't mention it to me. We have been flirting a lot. How do I behave when I see her on work in 2 days?

t3_dlqclg,How to not fall out with my suddenly detoxing mum,"My mum has had a very long opiate addiction, which she's done fairly well to manage with the help of her doctor in recent years. 

Mum has recently moved to our area and is staying with us whilst she finds her feet. To cut a long story short she has suddenly decided to stop taking her prescribed medication and come off after 20+ years and is using internet-bought crap she's read about to ease the cold-turkey (kratim?). Its been a week or so already, so shes doing pretty well, but its still a nightmare. She's miserable and unwell. She talks about drugs constantly and cant get dressed or help with anything around the house. She is snappy and argumentative. I have a young baby and I'm finding it very difficult to manage her and my own general stress levels and mental health. I'm torn between being angry at her, and not wanting to piss on her efforts, and I don't know how to handle it. I'm pleased she is trying to come off her medication,  but I'm dumbfounded as to why she decided to do it now, just after coming to stay with us. She didnt ever mention this plan and it's made the whole process of her being here exceptionally difficult. 

The idea was always to find her her own place eventually, but now I'm scared of bringing that up with her as she is sick from withdrawl and cant even manage to cook a meal, nevermind find a place to live. I'm flat out looking after the family and now I have her to look after too and I feel a bit trapped. I have no idea how long this process will take or if she'll just end up back on a prescription, or even worse illegal drugs. I feel like she's really selfish and that once again I'm being left to be the responsible one in the family. This has been going on for almost 30 years now, since I was a little girl.",relationship_advice

t3_dljoow,My parents left after my wedding without thanking anyone or saying goodbye,"So I just got married this past weekend on the 19th and the ceremony and reception were stunning. It truly was the greatest day of my entire life. 

To get to this point my now in-laws spent a near fortune and put in so much time to ensure we had the perfect day. They worked on the logistics and planning for near 16 months to ensure everything was in place. Me and my wife are thankful for them and for everything they did for us.

Now for my parents, they haven‚Äôt been the easiest to deal with throughout this whole process. They are both retired and have no hobbies other than staying at their house looking at birds outside, fishing, doing yard work, and drinking. They don‚Äôt really like traveling, which is fine, but when my mom was invited to the wedding shower she opted to not go due to cost of a plane ticket. Although once I dug into matters further it was clear she didn‚Äôt look at flights and just wanted to stay home.

Since my parents never made an effort to meet my now in-laws before the wedding they opted to come in a day early to get dinner with them. Dinner was great and I think it was so nice of them to meet with everyone. First thing I noticed after my mother in law snuck off to pay the bill was that my parents did not thank anyone for dinner. Which was was the first frustration for me.

The biggest frustration came from the fact my parents left without thanking the in-laws for the wedding and prep or saying goodbye to anyone. They didn‚Äôt even say goodbye to me or my wife. They left at 6 am to drive back to Arkansas from Arizona. All because they wanted to beat traffic. 

I am beyond pissed at this and I think doing that to my in-laws and my new family is BS. I honestly don‚Äôt feel like talking to my parents for a while and I‚Äôm struggling to see how I can move past this. Any tips or advice on how to approach my parents would be awesome.",relationship_advice
t3_dleb9g,I (33F) have reached my limit with one of my best friend‚Äôs (30F) refusal of help.,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Here goes. I am friends with a group of 5 girls, including myself, who all grew up on the same street, so we‚Äôve been friends for nearly 30 years at this point. We‚Äôve all moved and have gotten married, or are heading in that direction, and some have started families. Except for one. 

Her name is Lisa. Lisa‚Äôs sister is also part of our close knit group. Their mother died 3 years ago, after a nearly lifelong battle with cancer. Lisa‚Äôs sister has grieved and coped with this loss, with the help of her therapist. Lisa is just stuck? 

She‚Äôs 30 years old, she still lives with her dad, has never moved out at any point, and claims she financially couldn‚Äôt move out on her own. She has a lot of credit card debt - which was already racked up before her mother‚Äôs death. Even with the debt, and limited income, she signs up for every subscription box, and makes poor financial decisions altogether. Ex: she leased a car and has gone over her total mileage allowed for the term of the lease, in just the first year. Why? ‚ÄúBecause she drives a lot.‚Äù  

She also has  issues with men. Issues might not be the right word. But it‚Äôs a thing. So she likes to just collect men with whom she texts. She‚Äôs joined a dating app but will nearly never meet them IRL. It‚Äôs just another text buddy until they fizzle out. I‚Äôve recently gotten so frustrated because I found that she is manipulating me, in a way. She always come to me for advice and guidance, and though she never takes the advice or guidance, I still am always available to her. Now I find out that she‚Äôs been not telling me the whole truth. 

So, she recently met a guy, things are going well, yadda yadda. She and I had plans to hang out with some other people this past weekend. She tells me she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about this guy because she doesn‚Äôt want to jinx it. Ok. So I get to our friends house, and Lisa hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. Our mutual friend tells me that her husbands friend met Lisa and asked for her number. Mutual friend called Lisa and was like is it ok to give your number? She goes on to say he‚Äôs an alcoholic and he‚Äôs essentially not your type in any way. Lisa says ok just give him my Snapchat. Makes sense! Then this guy reports back that she‚Äôs saying some raunchy things and suggesting that she wants to have sex with him. What this guy doesn‚Äôt know is that Lisa has no intention of having sex with him!!! She just wants an admirer. Well, then it clicks. She doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúnot jinx‚Äù this other guy. She doesn‚Äôt want her new admirer to know that she has no interest in him. THATS why I can‚Äôt mention the guy she‚Äôs actually seeing/is interested in. Makes good sense right? 

Mutual friend also mentions Lisa‚Äôs ‚ÄúSnapchat husband‚Äù who I didn‚Äôt know about. This is a guy who‚Äôs in a 6 year long relationship with his gf. But he and Lisa have some kind of relationship. She‚Äôs so crazy she actually demanded that she be the first to know if he‚Äôs engaged. When he said he‚Äôd probably tell his family first, she got pissed. Omg this is all so rambling. 

Ultimately, all Lisa wants is a slew of guys to text with her all day and to shower her in compliments. But yet she can ‚Äúnever find a good guy.‚Äù  Because no guy just wants to text you all day!!!  

There‚Äôs also the fact that Lisa supposedly has this migraine problem. Everything gives her a migraine. Everything. She‚Äôs been to doctor after doctor and tried medication after medication. But nothing helps. Ya know what I think? I think they‚Äôre psychosomatic. She told me the other day that she had a migraine in her jaw. What??? Migraines don‚Äôt occur in random body parts!! 

With all this, she REFUSES to go to therapy. She recently said to me that it will literally never work for her. She‚Äôs just a locked vault and it‚Äôs soooo terrible. Boohoo. 

What do I do to get this woman to see that she needs help! She can‚Äôt sleep in her twin sized bed at her dads for the rest of her life. We all just have to smile and nod and aw poor Lisa her to death. I just can‚Äôt anymore. 

I don‚Äôt know if this post really got my point across at all. But it‚Äôs 3am and I can‚Äôt sleep, thinking about all this.  I can only give so much gentle, unheeded advice before I lose my mind. 

TLDR: my 30 year old friend still lives at home, has unhealthy romantic relationships, a lot of debt, fake medical issues, and I‚Äôve hit my limit.",relationship_advice

t3_dlq9s3,Should I have a final conversation with girlfriend after she broke up with me ?,"My girlfriend broke up with me after a month of being distant.

I did not take it well and had a breakdown and called her crying when i was really drunk.

I texted her to setup a final conversation to end things on a good note because I was embarrassed about how I handled it.

She is apparently really busy and said she could talk in like 10 days. I said I'd text her that day.

Only now, I'm feeling healthy and happy. I don't know if I want to talk to her anymore or if it will only be a step backwards. Is it rude to just not text her again and let it go? Will this create more attraction towards me for placing myself in high value and knowing I don't need her to comfort me anymore?

There is a small piece of me that thinks we could get back together in the future, I don't know if this would make her more attracted to me, or resent me.

I was nothing but a good boyfriend in the relationship. She broke up with me because she ""needed to focus on her""

t3_dlq7s9,GF (28) wants to take a break from our relationship because I (25) went on a trip with my brother instead of visiting her.,"I apologize in advance because this will be long.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years, and spent the last year living together. Everything had been great in our relationship so far, whenever a problem arised we talked about it and fixed it, we talked instead of arguing, and we had no major issues. We agreed on most of the fundamental aspects of relationships and life, and are (were?) really in love. At least from my side I can assure I love her to pieces. By far the best relationship I've had.

After our work visa expired we both moved to our respective home countries with the intention of dating long distance until we could close the distance.
Before we moved back she found a job in my country which made everything easier, and will move here in about a month. We both were really excited about her coming here, and thought we'd have no problems with being apart for 3 or 4 months. We even made plans for her to come visit me earlier so we could look for appartments in the city where she'll be working and have a nice trip around here, but it never happened because things in her home country are pretty bad rn and she wanted to give that money to her family (which I'm totally support and accept, I think that's a super nice and thoughtful thing, and that's why I fell in love with her in the first place).

We've been apart since August. 3 days after geeting home I got into car accident that left me unable to walk (spent the last 2 months in a wheelchair), and I just recovered from it. She's been having some problems while home, mostly feeling like she doesn't fit there, being bored because she doesn't have a job and missing me. I think it doesn't help that we spent a lot of time together during last year,  so now the contrast is pretty stark.

She's been pushing me to go visit her before she move here, and I told her I would as soon as I could, but that right now I couldn't because of 4 main reasons:

1. I was unable to walk and I had to undergo periodical cures because of the injuries I suffered.

2. As I moved back home I have no job, and wanted to spend all the time I could trying to find one, hopefully before she arrives here.

3. I had (have) no money. I actually owe her a lot of money because she'd been helping me with the bills of our appartment for the last year. She insisted that she would pay for it, but as I said I already owe her a lot of money and don't want for her to spend so much  on a flight and then supporting me while I'm there.

4.I had to study for a very important exam that I have this weekend.

Me not visiting her caused some arguments between us, but ultimately we decided that I would visit her as soon as I could but that it would not be before me taking the aforementioned exam. 

The real problem comes when my brother, without consulting me, got us flights to go abroad for a weekend. This last weekend.

Now, I love my brother. He is the best thing that I have in this world (followed by my gf and parents), he is sweet, caring and we share a very special bond. But he messed up. He knew about how me and my gf had been struggling with distance, how we'd argued about me not visiting her, and despite all of that he bought me a ticket to go somewhere else. He'd pay for everything and it was only a weekend, so I wouldn't lose a lot of study time and I'd still be able to go to any job interview during the week.

Before I decided to go I told her what happened, how he surprised me with a flight that I had never asked for or wanted. And understandably she got really upset. 
After talking it for a couple weeks she seemed a little bit more content with the idea of me going, as otherwise the flight would have been gone to waste and my brother did it as a nice gesture.

But when I landed there she texted me telling me how she was really upset, felt betrayed and understood now that my priorities were to party with my brother instead of visiting her. She asked for some time, and later told me she'd rather for us not to talk to eachother until she moves here. I offered to go visit her after I'm done with the exam (next week) and I receive the accident settlement money, but she is still really upset and thinks about breaking up.

Now, I know I messed up going to that trip, I hurt her feelings (although inadvertently) and her trust, and I don't know what to do to solve this, or how to start a conversation with her to start working on rebuilding our relationship.

I'd appreciate any advice or suggestion about this situation. I know I sound like an asshole but I'd never hurt her on purpose, (although I'm obviously stupid enough to have done it either way), and I really want to make things right to her.

Thanks in advance guys.",relationship_advice
t3_dlq6wv,"My (24/f) boyfriend (30/m) talked about how his previous therapist from five years ago ‚Äúlooked good‚Äù so he couldn‚Äôt open up to her, since he ‚Äúwanted to get laid‚Äù?","My boyfriend recently started getting therapy and chose an older man (in his 70s). (Btw he is getting therapy to work on issues for making our relationship work.) 

When I asked him about the gender/age of his therapist, he said he intentionally chose an older man because his one previous experience with therapy was when he was 25 years old and the therapist was a 28 year old blonde female. He said ‚Äúshe looked good‚Äù and was unable to open up to her honestly because he thought in his head, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say that - I can‚Äôt get laid.‚Äù 

I got hurt/upset, especially because we have had turbulence in our relationship and had JUST been getting better. It hurt more because recently he has been intentionally avoiding giving me compliments because I claimed he ‚Äúlove-bombed‚Äù me and I fell for him b/c he made me feel ‚Äúspecial.‚Äù He said he still stands by all the compliments he gave me before and still finds me attractive, but he wants me to genuinely want him for who he is, not because I love how he makes me feel special / fuels my ego, which makes sense. I do see where he‚Äôs coming from. 

Anyway, when I told him all this, he didn‚Äôt really seem sorry. His response to my hurt was ‚Äúwhy? She had nothing on you‚Äù basically that I am more attractive. That actually made me more upset because that wasn‚Äôt the point.

t3_dlq40a,Arguing with someone that you're not even dating,"This girl and I have been seeing each other for almost four months and our relationship hasn't been the healthiest. It was built on a very unstable foundation and we have major communication problems because I'm always too scared to tell her how I feel. We would get into arguments and small petty fights even though we're not dating. Also the reason why we argue a lot is that we have an open relationship and I'm always lying to myself saying ""I don't care, she can do whatever she wants"" but in the end, I really do care. She's seeing another guy and I'm seeing another person too, but I could care less about the person I'm seeing because all want is to be with her. I don't know if she feels the same though. A couple days ago, we had an argument over text because she told me that she was going to see the guy, and that pissed me off because I didn't need to know that. I called her out for being disrespectful and she said ""I don't understand you, you told me you didn't care if i was seeing other people"" which is true, but I only tell her I don't care because I don't have the right to control her life and tell her who she can see or not see. It's her life, she can do whatever she wants. On Sunday, she texted me that she doesn't want to see me for a while and we haven't talked since.

I know, even if all the events are olds, i have to consult.... 

My question is for the men. I want to know. If your girlfriend had experience a lot of trauma, did you want to know just a tiny bit of it or did you want to know really much of it except the details? At least how many times and in wich situation? I don‚Äôt know...

I don‚Äôt want to keep im from it and i don‚Äôt want im to feel like i don‚Äôt trust him. I don‚Äôt want im to think of me like i‚Äôm broken or like i don‚Äôt trust him.

The rest, there are just the mens and me that know. I never told anyone the rest... because it was a doctor or a chiroprator... or a friend of the family.

t3_dlq26x,I [24/M] think I am still in love with a girl [22/F] I dated for 2 months who moved back to Germany. Need advice.,"Apologies for the length of this post, I just really need to get this off my chest. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to hear me out.

I have always struggled with social anxiety, and have never had a meaningful long term relationship in my life. So, earlier this year, I did what most single guys who don't go out much do and made a Tinder account. I met a girl on there and we really hit it off over texts, so we set up a date at a local bar.

She was absolutely stunning. Smart, beautiful, funny, interesting, and everything else you could ever dream for in a girl. We talked and drank until midnight and we were too tired to continue. We didn't wait long to see each other again, and again we talked and drank all night. We kissed, and from that point she had stolen my heart. I think it was the first time I have ever truly been in love.

However, there is a catch: She is German. She was only here to complete an internship that was necessary for her to apply to PhD programs here in the States (she already has a master's degree at the age of 22. That's how smart and amazing she is). 

She left for Germany 2 months later with the status of if she would ever come back to my area of the States up in the air. We agreed to stay in touch, but we didn't really address the status of our relationship (we never really explicitly said that we were dating, I think because we both knew it would have to end soon). 

Messages got more and more far apart and now it's been 3 months since we've spoken. I don't know about her, but the reason I stopped messaging her regularly is for two reasons:

1. I wanted to move on. The distance just seems too far for us to work out. Even if she returns to the states to complete her PhD, it's unlikely to be anywhere near me.

2. I don't know if I was as special to her as she was to me. Frankly, I highly doubt it. While I have never been in a long term relationship, she had been in one that lasted 8 years (Yes, 8. That's not a typo). The guy had purposed to her and she rejected it because she felt she was too young and had no idea where her life would take her, which led to them breaking up. A 2 month fling with some American boy must be totally forgettable by her standards, right?

Every date I've been on since then just hasn't been the same. Nobody is as smart, as beautiful, or as funny as her. I can't get her out of my head. It's like I am not even looking for another girl, I'm just looking for the next ""her"". 

However, because I have never been in love before, I am really concerned that I'm just working myself up and making what we had out to be more than it was since I have nothing to compare it to. Maybe what we had was mediocre at best, but I just have nothing to compare it to?

I don't know what to do. It's unlikely she feels the same way about me and even if she did we are practically on opposite sides of the planet; should I just forget about her? We haven't spoken in 3 months; would it be too weird to suddenly tell her how I feel? I didn't even do that properly while she was here.

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I just feel lost.",relationship_advice

t3_dlq08x,LDR intimate advice please!,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for two years now, and I recently moved away for uni. We see each other once every two weeks so the time we do get to spend together is special. 

Last weekend when I saw him, we did have sex on Saturday, however, I discovered something on the Sunday. So I wanted to use his phone to search something and I asked him if I could use it and he said yes, so I opened up his internet and I guess he forgot to close the page down but he had porn up on the screen.

Now I don‚Äôt care that he watches that, however, in the morning when we woke up he told me he was going to the bathroom and took his phone with him, so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs when he must have done it.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm over thinking this, but we see each other every two weeks, and I‚Äôm right next to him in bed why doesn‚Äôt he want me? It crushed my confidence a bit to be honest as it made me feel like he didn‚Äôt want me, he preferred to go the bathroom and sort himself out over being with me...

Before I moved out, he got a new job and was working a lot so our sex life was very little, like once a week if I was lucky. And yes I did try initiate as well. His reasonings for it was that he was tired from working all the time. Our sex life went from 2-3 a week to basically nothing really. 

I just don‚Äôt know whether to confront him or not, is it my fault? 

And no I won‚Äôt break up with him, he is my best friend and other than that the relationship is perfect but why is he choosing porn over me? 

Thankyou hope this is in the right group

t3_dlpzwg,Basically I think I'm loosing my bestfriend and I need to know how to control myself.,"I met this girl about 3-4 years ago and we have been best friends ever since. She has stayed over at mine, we've cuddled, I've given her hoodies and other cute things and couples usually do but we tend to ignore that because we are not a couple. 
It was about 1/2 a year ago when I truly caught feelings for her like big time but she just recently got a boyfriend as I was too afraid to ask her to by my girlfriend in case it would ruin our friendship. 
I still like her but she's slowly cutting me off and spending more time with him than me and her usually did, which sounds selfish I know but she used to always cut time for me but now she just won't. 
I need advice on how to overcome my feelings for her as I feel I've lost my chance and we will never connect again. I will always be there for her but I fear she won't be there for me. Can someone help me on deciding how to solve this and get over her as I just cry over the fact I'm loosing her more and more everyday.",relationship_advice

Known her for longer and I'm in love with her, which is my 19(m) own problem I suppose. We have a normal relationship, caring nights in, emotional intimacy and our fair share of sex. The problem is every time she goes on a night out without me, she always ends up having sex with some other guy. I knew she was polyamorous when we went on the adventure and she promises she only really enjoys the sex with me. Every time I try to leave her because it hurts to know what she's doing, she promises she'll tone it down. I don't ask her to, I want her to be happy being her but I keep coming back. She's way out of my league and could do so much better. Is there a way I can learn to be okay with her having sex with other men?

t3_dlpxr5,Why does this happen,"So this might just be more of a rant but if anyone has had success in getting through to their sig other in regards to this i would apreciate guidance. So as a back story i have been single for a long time something along the lines of 8 years. Work kept me busy and a few casual friends warmed my nights. Now two years ago i get in a relationship and 8 months ago she moved in. Since she has moved in have made locations and even told her to setup whatever area she wants as her own for her stuff except for my computer desk and my side of the bed. Along with this i have been trying a new diet cutting out booze, caffene, and a workout routine. So now to the issue. When i told her i stopped caffene she kept offering me some form of caffene every day and on the weekenda 6 times in one day. I went on keto and everything she wanted to eat or go out too since is the most carb heavy food one can imagine. I stopped drinking and she goes out buys bottles brings them home and on the weekends sets up drinking dates with our friends. As for the house and giving her space i have asked that no wet towels be left on the bed due to mold and ruining the finish. She now only leaves the towels on the bed stating she is groggy in the morning and forgets. Also my desk and my side of the bed no longer are clear but instead have makeup, deoderant, her random clutter all over them. In an attempt to prevent this i bought shelves and a makup station and moved her dresser that has a giant mirror into the bedroom yet she still insists on putting her stuff where i ask her not to. She also gets upset when i point it out. Anyone got any ideas on how i can deal with someone who claims its not intentional?",relationship_advice
t3_dlpwbo,Not sure if partner and I are right for each other,"I don‚Äôt have much experience with relationships. Please don‚Äôt default to ‚Äúwell if you‚Äôre asking you‚Äôre not!‚Äù

We‚Äôre alike in some ways different in others... they are more emotional and sometimes violently so while I can be overly rational and miss cues. They‚Äôre a sculptor I‚Äôm a programmer and it shows sometimes. I don‚Äôt want to get into too much detail. 

One thing they said recently is that sometimes it seems like I want to change them... hit me hard. I apolofiZed right away. But it stuck with me and it gives me that pit... and I think maybe I do want to change them sometimes. Mainly that a lot of times I want to have a calm discussion and not get angry or slam doors or things but they said that‚Äôs their personality... that when they sit quietly and control themselves they‚Äôre acting like me not them... maybe yea... they said they are not me and I have to have realistic expectation. 

A few times I even really insistes therapy because I thought hey it will help their self esteem and make them more comfortable with opening up... they got mad and said therapy makes them too vulnerable... I said if it‚Äôs hard that‚Äôs exactly when it‚Äôs a good idea. I asked them to promise me to try it... 

Is this kind of thing a sign that I want somebody else? Maybe it‚Äôs the case that we‚Äôre better off with people who understand like that, that they can find someone who understands them... I don‚Äôt know.

t3_dlhlad,"I [31F] can't say ""I love you"" to my SO [31M].","My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months. We've rode a bit of a wave together. Early on, a month in, he said ""I think I'm falling for you,"" to which I replied, ""Me too.""

Afterwards, I had a bit of a panic. I realized very quickly that the remnants of hurt and pain from abandonment of my ex (who was my fianc√©) were still lingering. I was terrified of the seriousness of this relationship and kind of shut down. I communicated this with my BF and he was very patient and understanding. I expressed I would be attending counseling in order to sort out this trauma and get myself straight. He was extremely supportive and said he would do whatever it was I needed; time apart, slow things down, be more vocally attentive and provide more words of affirmation. I said I'd like to keep it at the pace it was at but work on myself simultaneously. 

After a couple of months of counseling, my BF and I went camping and he told me he loved me. I smiled and kissed him and held him tight. But I didn't say it back. To be honest, things got a little worse after this, before they got better. I suffered some disassociation and struggled with our relationship. I was very communicative about this with him. And once again, he was extremely supportive. Apologized for having made that declaration and told me he would simply focus on being there for me in this time of need. 

I truly got to the root of my problem through counseling. No need to go into extreme detail but I was abandoned by my mother at a young age and my fianc√© brought back this old trauma. I have since rediscovered all of my old resources to deal with this and feel 1000% better. I feel renewed and healthy. No more panic or disassociation. Sometimes you just need to call something by its name to be the master of it. 

Anyway, about 3 Saturdays ago, my BF and I attended this wonderful dress up cocktail bday party for a friend and had the BEST NIGHT. He looked so good, and tickled my back while I was sitting there chatting with friends. He noticed me across the room and winked and bought me a drink and I knew that night, I had caught up. I'm there/here. I love him. But now I'm a scared piece of crap who can't utter it. I keep looking at him some type of way and I wonder if he knows. I can't find the right moment. Ahhhhhh.. I feel like a dumb 16 year old again. 

Help me say those 3 little words.

t3_dl7b6e,99% sure my wife of over 25 years is having an affair. Not sure how to go forward...,"About a year and a half ago, my wife began to overcome some chronic pain that had been really holding her down for years. During this time she has also been involved in a family business that puts a lot of stress on her. She hates going to work and feels trapped by her family obligations. Also during this time we became empty nesters. As she started feeling physically better, we started going out dancing to various bars in the area with bands. One place in particular really appealed to her and we brought several sets of friends along to experience it, but none of them were really interested in going back very often. 

Now, my wife likes dancing more than I do. I enjoy dancing with her, but once or twice a week is sort of enough for me. Long story short, she has been going out some nights without me for a while now, mostly with girlfriends. At one point, this other guy started paying her more attention. She said that she was happy to have a guy friend and we went round and round about whether it was appropriate. At one point, I happened to see a text come through with the little kissy emoji and called her out on it. She told me that she shut him down saying it wasn't appropriate, and he since got into a relationship with a woman who lives about 3 hours away. He is part of a group of friends/acquaintances that we do things with from time to time. She got into the habit of meeting him for a walk after work on nice afternoons. When our conversations would circle around to him, she always assured me that he knew she was happily married and that she would never do anything other than talk with him.

Last night though, she went out to the Sunday band at this bar down the road. She said that she was meeting a girlfriend (who I know) and that she was planning to be home early because she has a big work week starting today. A bit after 10, she texted that the music was over and they were hanging out chatting.I had been doing laundry, so got the text about 1/2 hr later and said, great drive safe. ""Will do""

I went to bed and woke up around 1:45. Texted her asking if she was OK. ""Yes, heading home.""

At 2:40 I texted Tonight? ""Yes""

At 4:00 I called her phone and it went to voice mail. She called back in a few minutes and said that she fell asleep at some woman's house where they went to hang out.

She got home 20 minutes later, came and gave me a kiss on the forehead (I was awake in bed) I just gave her a sort of gruff hello and she ended up curled up going to sleep on the couch downstairs. I went down and gave her a hug and asked if she understood why I was upset. She said, yes, and I'm so sorry, and I didn't want to keep you up. I told her I hadn't slept since i woke up hours ago anyway and she might as well come to bed. She cuddled up next to me and fell asleep.

In the morning, she got up before me and basically gave a quick kiss going out the door. I saw that she had done a small load of laundry with just her clothes from the night before. I have purposefully given her her digital privacy, but during the night I admit I checked her iPad messages. There didn't seem to be any on messenger. When I got to work, I pulled up our cell phone account that I manage and looked at her text log. I ran a reverse phone number search to ID the most often texted number and founf that it did belong to ""the guy"" She had texted with him before she left to go out, right before she left to come home, and first thing in the morning. I looked back further and found that she often texted with him before bed and first thing in the morning when she typically has her coffee. The real gut punch though, was when I looked at the call logs. Multiple calls per day with him for weeks, including long calls, some over an hour.

I texted her at work and asked how her day was going. ""Awful on many levels. I deserve it.""

I told her that we needed to talk and suggested meeting after work before we go home. ""ok"" (lower case) Rechecked the call log and saw two calls to the guy this morning, one before I texted her and one after.

I am just heartbroken and feel like I'm going to be sick. I do love her, but looking back over the past months, I did feel her pulling away. I'm guilty of being online too much in the evenings, but in the past we've always had a solid couple of hours of reconnecting at home after work. Lately, we have been getting home later and skipping a traditional dinner, so we haven't had that daily time consistently.

So full disclosure, I‚Äôve never been in this position before and am really anxious and unsure about how to go about things. I‚Äôm in my first year of college and from a small town in the midwestern US and never really had anybody actually click with me very well in a romantic sense (and not for a lack of trying at least on my end). Anyways as it so happened my first week at uni I wound up meeting this girl at a picnic thing for students directly admitted to their chosen college and right off the bat I was kinda drawn to her. As it turned out we were majoring in the same subject and have a class together so we wound up keeping in contact and became friends. We have a lot in common and we also get along really well and seem to enjoy each other‚Äôs company.

She was fired from her job for it, continued the relationship in secret under the guise that it was a ""mother/son"" dynamic. But then she came out of the shadows in September of 2018, left her husband (my dad 55M) of 23 years and moved in with this new kid (19M). 

I tried maintaining a distant relationship with her despite this, but a month or so into it, she accused me of only reaching out to her when I needed something, and picking other people over her to take care of my 18 month old daughter, while I worked, out of spite. That was when the crazy met its tipping point and I cut her out for good. 

It's been almost a year since I stopped talking to her. Most days I'm fine, today I broke down in tears while I was working because I missed her so much. Aside from my husband, she was the closest person to me in the world. She kept our family nest very tight knit and assured me and my siblings that we were always her priority and she would never pick anyone over us. 

It's also worth mentioning that this kid she's living with is a heavy drinker and smoker, owns multiple weapons, has misdemeanor assault charges on his record, and he acts like a petulant child during most interactions. He's of remarkably below average intelligence (my mother was a special education teacher) and has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. Watching the two of them interact makes my stomach churn.

I've been mulling this over since I was 14/15. I've gone back and forth for a long long time about being gay and I've finally come to the finite conclusion that I am. No matter how many men I dated, I never got the same feeling as when I was with a woman. I even found myself frequently wishing for a girlfriend even when I had a boyfriend. Four abusive male relationships (not saying men are abusive, just facts from my life) and two female relationships later, I finally find someone that doesn't treat me like shit. He's incredible, honestly. But no matter how hard I tried, I found myself not wanting to have sex and feeling more and more romantically repulsed by him. It made me realize than no matter what man I dated, I just wasn't into men. He's a super nice and very pro-LGBT+ so I'm not worried about homophobia or any dangers from him. He's a teddy bear. I just want to make this as painless as possible for him.

I haven't even come out to my family yet. They're not homophobic either, but I feel like I'm wasting my current bfs time and lying to him by not telling him I'm gay. I feel like I've been lying to myself for 21 years and internalizing my sexuality, even though I've been openly bi for years and years. Yes, I'm sure I'm gay. I tried to gain feelings for him for a month and a half but I just don't have any. I love girls, I really do. There's no doubt.

t3_dlpiu0,Is being cheap a dealbreaker?,"I feel like a POS for this, but I‚Äôve distanced myself from my boyfriend after having a slow burn epiphany: he is cheap. This was facilitated by my friend‚Äôs reaction to an incident of cheapness that led to a larger convo which revealed some persistent cheapness that I have tried to ignore.

I can‚Äôt give details, he uses Reddit, but he‚Äôs definitely cheap and NOT frugal - thank you, Google, for teaching me the difference. Like he spends on himself (the latest model phone or a new tablet, eating out often, several vacations a year, etc) + receives generosity from others, but hesitates to return it.

I wrote this off for awhile because, really, I don‚Äôt mind splitting bills. It seems fair. Also he is fucking amazing in every other way and  I do mean every. Other. Way. He‚Äôs kind, respectful, brilliant, and so sexy. We are very compatible in every way but this one. 

We come from different economic backgrounds so I thought, well, maybe he wasn‚Äôt taught generosity and money doesn‚Äôt come as easily to him. You can‚Äôt give what you don‚Äôt have. That said.. His salary is greater than mine but not by much. I also have kids, he doesn‚Äôt. I own a home and car, he doesn‚Äôt. His fixed expenses are way lower than mine. 

One of the things that my friend asked me which kind of did it for me was: ‚ÄúHas he ever bought anything for your kids?‚Äù He‚Äôs never met them, but we‚Äôve been together for over a year. Birthdays, holidays have come and gone and no, he‚Äôs never bought them anything. She seemed appalled by this, given how much my kids mean to me. ‚ÄúA little doll? Anything?‚Äù She was exasperated and it forced me to question why I wasn‚Äôt. So now, it bothers me.

If asked in person, she would say yes and would not follow through even after she said she would, she would use excuses of sleeping and being tired to not do this. As of recent, she has been trying to get into the feet picture scene, talking to people trying to sell pics, and she's been on her phone for the whole day texting other people. She's been taking more photos than ever, but she still doesn‚Äôt have time to even take a quick photo to send to her S/O.

I brought it up to him today like hey can you call me after work and he said I guess then which I got mad at saying why do you have to say it like that and then he said because I don‚Äôt think I need to call you. I then explained to him how I don‚Äôt want to be chasing after him and waiting for him to be in the ‚Äúmood‚Äù to talk we always talk at night on discord and before bed but during the day when he‚Äôs at work he will just leave me on read but I will see him on Facebook or on twitter or he won‚Äôt respond to my text and just send me memes... he says that he feels that he is never enough for me and I feel like I am never enough for him.

t3_dlm3qu,"Completely blew my [26M] second chance with my ex-girlfriend [26F], who I treated badly in the past. Freaking out. Is there anything I can do to make it up to her???","Met freshman year of college, dated for three years. For the last year or so of the relationship I became heavily depressed and very addicted to video games, mostly due to being very unhappy in my major/classes. We'd moved in together at the time and I would ignore her all day to play LoL and WoW. She was concerned for me and kept trying to convince me I was depressed and I had an addiction, and that I needed to go to therapy or take a break from school, but I would instead get mad at her and complain loudly to my friends that my girlfriend was ""nagging"" me again. I was in denial I guess and didn't wanna admit I was depressed. She would make elaborate dinners for me and her to eat together and I'd just tell her to bring it to my room so I could eat while playing games. I look back on this now and I cringe. After the second time I told her to take a taxi to the airport (instead of me driving her there, like I'd promised), because I was in the middle of playing WoW, she broke up with me from the airport. I actually didn't see her again after this, as she got her brothers to come pick up her stuff from our apartment.

Her breaking up with me was kind of a wake up call, and I decided to take some time off of school and go to therapy, and I started doing much better. Got over my video game addiction as well. Three years later, I ran into her at a wedding for a mutual friend, and we started talking again. She was amazing, hadn't changed at all--kind, funny, beautiful, smart. I eventually apologized for how I'd behaved at the end of our relationship and she forgave me. Since we were both single, I asked her out around this time, but she said no, because she didn't think she could fully trust me not to abandon her again.

Fast forward to this year, she happens to move to my city for a new job, and we start hanging out again. I'm really starting to like her again, and we hang out a lot, after work and on the weekends. A month ago, she's over at my house eating dinner and she says she'd like to give it another try, so we get back together.

The fuck-up came two nights ago, when I was talking to an acquaintance from college (that she also knows, but doesn't like). He's someone I play games with and is kind of a dick, but I'd generally ignored the fact that he was a douchebag because he was fun to play games with. She was over at my place, sleeping because she'd been working all night, and I'd just gotten back from getting dinner and drinks with some of my work friends. I was on the phone with this friend on my walk home, and drunk as I was, I put him on speakerphone once I got home so I could wash the dishes. Basically, he started talking shit about my girlfriend, and I went along with it because I was drunk and I didn't wanna make him mad. He said things like, ""Oh, so she dumps you when you're down, and now you're better and making good money she comes crawling back?"" and I think I laughed and said ""I know, right"" or something like that. There were other things like that.

Turns out the speakerphone had woken my girlfriend up, and she'd heard the entire conversation. I found her upset, asking me if that's what I really thought, and why I even wanted to get back together with her if he thought that. She also  accused me of lying when I apologized to her about my addiction, etc., and that she didn't know why I was even still friends with a douchebag like that. She said that maybe this had been a mistake, and she didn't wanna be with me anymore, because she never knew if she could trust me. I feel like this was her overreacting a tad bit, and tried to calm her down, but she grabbed all her stuff and left, and it's been radio silence for the past two days.

It also turned out that she'd woken up when I got home because she wanted to surprise me with some cinnamon buns she made, since she knows they're my favorite snack... I feel pretty bad.

I'm freaking out here. I know she has trust issues with me and I made them worse--should I keep contacting her? Send her a long message/letter? I really need this to work out and I don't understand why she's doing this to me when things were going so well. Has anyone ever had any experience getting someone back after something like this?

**TL;DR**: College girlfriend broke up with me because I wouldn't admit to being depressed and having a video game addiction and treating her horribly. I got a second chance with her a month ago and I think I blew it again by going along with some shit my friend was saying, when she already has issues trusting me.

t3_dlm1js,Advice on how to move from best friends to a couple 33F/31M,"TL;DR: Old friends are new couple how do I try to move things to sweet instead of friendly.

Last week I finally decided to be true to myself (33F) and tell my (31M) roommate/best friend/occasional FWB that I do genuinely have feelings for him and that since we've lived together so long and have a sexual relationship that we should give it a shot.  He agreed and we became an official couple and I'm happy.  I'm content and I'm excited to see where this takes us.



We've been friends for at least 5 years and he's lived with me for over a year and a half, spending I would say 80% of that time already sleeping in my bed, but mostly non sexually.  In the past our hookup moments had tended to be under the influence of alcohol, until the last time when we both mentioned we should do this more often sober.   Then we did, and all of this got in my head that I really want to make it work.

The issue, I don't know how to get past the routines that we already have as friends and make it less awkward to do the things that are more relationship-y.  I want to hold hands dammit and get random kisses dammit!

It all feels kind of forced right now, and I'm unsure if that's cause I've perhaps pushed him into something he may not have actually wanted or if it's just gonna be a weird transition because we are already set in our ways.

We are good partners, we help each other and each other's families, we cook together, make money together and genuinely are all cute and homey.  IEveryone has thought we were together for a while

t3_dlpdzt,How do I (22M) politely uninvite a female friend (21F) from spending the night at our hotel?,"Hi all,

My brother (24M) and I (22M) are taking a trip to Vegas this weekend. I have a high school friend who lives about an hour away and wanted to come hang out with us. She wanted to go clubbing with us and then crash at our hotel, which is theoretically fine as there are two king-size beds, one of which I could share with my brother. She requested off of work on the following day in order to go sightseeing, the three of us.

The problem is that I am in a relationship, and this other girl may have different intentions than just having a few drinks. Even if this isn't the case, I am not great friends with her, which would make everything questionable to my girlfriend. I know for a fact that I would not be okay with this turn of events if I were in my girlfriend's position, which is why I want to uninvite the other girl from drinking and then sleeping at our place, as politely as possible, but I think it is still okay if we met up and she showed us around the next day.

I completely trust myself in not cheating on my girlfriend no matter what as I am very happy in my relationship, but this would look way questionable. The other girl sort of invited herself two days ago and I was kind of uncomfortable, so I agreed to allow her to spend the night.

So reddit, how do I get out of this mess?

\- I was thinking of telling the girl that me or my brother got very sick so we didn't want to go drinking anymore

\- Was thinking of saying that our reservation got changed and we were moved to a single room with just one bed, so there is no room for her to spend the night.

Well Reddit, any tips? Should I go with an excuse or just be honest? If it means anything, I don't think my friend would appreciate my honesty, which is why I was leaning towards making some kind of excuse, but honesty just may be the best policy.",relationship_advice
t3_dlpdwd,My boyfriend (23) often makes half-hearted comments and puts down the topic when I (21) talk about my interests.,"It isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs done this and it‚Äôs honestly a very small issue but it does affect me to a degree . I just don‚Äôt know how to fully go about it. 

I was watching a scary movie today since it‚Äôs a slow day at work. I‚Äôm not a huge obsessed horror thriller fanatic but I do find them enjoyable and I watch from time to time. I was texting my boyfriend and I mentioned I was watching a scary movie. He messages back that he doesn‚Äôt find them enjoyable since he‚Äôd rather watch something more relaxing. I replied that I like them sometimes since I like to figure out what happens before the movie ends. He replies with ‚ÄúIntriguing. How does that make you feel?‚Äù. At that point I see he‚Äôs really not interested at all and doesn‚Äôt care to at least move the conversation along but instead just teases at my interest. 

It happened previously with my music interest and he just says things like ‚Äúwhat is this??‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs listen to something else‚Äù.  I understand he has different tastes and we don‚Äôt have to share it. 

He‚Äôs a history buff and he reads about it a lot and can tell you everything from personal stories of soldiers to  the type of planes and tanks they use. I love history myself but not the extent he does. He can talk about it for hours and go into detail about things that just don‚Äôt interest me but I always keep asking questions because I see that it really excites him and makes him happy to talk about it. 

I do wish he‚Äôd give that amount of effort but I don‚Äôt want it to be forced. I‚Äôd also rather just not talk about my interests because I don‚Äôt necessarily need him to be interested either. 

I have talked about how his comments do sting a little since it is about something I like and that I don‚Äôt need to talk about with him. But he insists that he wants me to be comfortable and as happy talking about things with him as I would be with my friends.

t3_dlpdnn,Mom and step dad fought. Don't know what to do.,"My (18F) mom and stepdad fought just now. They were out with my brother and stepfather got drunk and they came back and were fighting. It escalated and it sounded like it was becoming too...bad so I had to intervene and yell at THEM. I yelled at both of them because I thought and think both are acting irrationally and childish. 

Basically: My stepfather and mother have been married for 9 years, had my step brother 7 years ago. About 2 years ago my stepfather had heart surgery and doctors prohibited cigarettes and marijuana. He stopped for a while, then resumed using both. My mother is clearly unhappy with that and pointed it out today as well... while he was drunk. Now I honestly think he is not a bad person but he gets too much when he's drunk. He hated that my mother kept bugging him about stopping doing both and I guess while being drunk he got 100x mad. 

Back to what happened: I yelled at them but he took it as an offense directly to HIMSELF and then started  yelling at me for choosing wrong sides and he is mad at me and threatening my mother that she had just made the worst mistake ever. My mother doesn't work and I just started university and cannot get a stable job to support them, so stepfather was/is the breadwinner. Truth be told I am lowkey terrified and scared right now because he is not in his right mind. I know I should call the police should anything happen but I'm hoping it doesn't get to that.

t3_dlpcm8,I‚Äôm not sure if I acted like the crazy ex. Looking for a strangers opinion.,"Okay. Firstly, I‚Äôm mainly only writing this to clear my own conscious. It‚Äôs funny how we have to do things in life to make you look back and say *‚ÄùWhat in the flying fuck was I thinking?‚Äù I just want to point out something‚Äôs before I explain how irrational I acted. I‚Äôm at a point now where i‚Äôm content with everything.

**1.** This was my first breakup. 
**2.** She was the first person I‚Äôve loved in this way.
**3.** My emotions got the best of me, and I couldn‚Äôt control myself.

Looking back, I realized the relationship was very one sided. I even overhead her and one of her friends having a conversation about me. She said things such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not committed to him‚Äù ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt care if it ended‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is only a temporary relationship.‚Äù I did confront her on this and she ended up crying because she wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúin a good place emotionally.‚Äù 

Now I look back and see she only cried because I caught her saying these things. I should of broke up with her, but I was just praying she‚Äôd have a change of heart. There is **A** **LOT** more examples, however that‚Äôs not the purpose of this. 

On to the breakup and how I acted crazy:
*this all occurred two months ago and it was a LDR*

Two days prior to the breakup, I called her out on how I felt about the relationship. I told her I didn‚Äôt think it was fair that I gave 100% and she struggled to give 50%. She got upset at that and proceeded to not talk to me for the next two days. That morning, I sent her a text saying ‚ÄúAre you really not going to text me?‚Äù She then got pissed at me because ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt feel like she needed to.‚Äù 

I was very confused and hurt. All I wanted was her to try harder. Then, she called me on the phone. She broke up with me and time just stopped. I started to cry and told her that I loved her and wanted us to work out.  

She blamed the breakup on her ‚ÄúStress‚Äù she then told me she loved me and that this breakup wasn‚Äôt an ‚ÄúEnd all be all‚Äù ‚ÄúWe could try again sometime‚Äù and ‚ÄúShes going to miss me so much.‚Äù

Cue false hope. I can vividly remember thinking ‚Äúphew, great. I can save this! She‚Äôs only stressed!‚Äù So two days later, I jumped in my car amped up on false hope and a mission. My intentions were good, I even bought her roses. I drove *nine hours* to see her.

Yes, go ahead and cringe. 

I saw her then gave her the flowers to which she took a deep breath and rolled her eyes. In a span of 5 seconds everything I believed for the past two days went down the drain. Thoughts of ‚ÄúWhy am I here‚Äù ran through my mind.  However, part of me still hoped for the best so I tried my best to talk to her. She told me I ruined her day and she didn‚Äôt want to see me. That hurt. After 10 more minutes of me begging and being desperate it was time for me to leave. But, not before she came up to me gave me a hug, a kiss, she told me she loved me, and would think about everything.

what. the. fuck. False hope part 2?

I texted her a few times over the next couple of days to which she was very short, understandably. However, eventually I was getting annoyed that she kept saying she needed ‚Äúmore time.‚Äù Then, I called her out on that.
She told me to have a nice life. Haven‚Äôt spoken since. The break up to no more contact was about 2 weeks. A very eventful two weeks.  

I‚Äôm only writing this to say I understand I was stupid. I should‚Äôve just accepted the breakup and left it at that. I shouldn‚Äôt have driven there. Life‚Äôs learning from all the bad decisions we make and i‚Äôve definitely learned all that I could‚Äôve.  Part of me still hopes she‚Äôll contact me one day. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôd even want that.

I posted this about a month and a half ago, and I felt like updating you all on what has happened.

Reminder:

J: Former best friend

S: Ex

I want to say thank you all for your advice and support on the last post, and I want to say it really helped.

&amp;#x200B;

S gave me a call saying she was still in love with me and never loved J; but an hour later told me she loved J and not me. I was furious and fed up.

&amp;#x200B;

So then, I cut S from my life. She still followed me on social media and we still had a snapchat streak but I told her I didn't want to be friends with her if she was going to act like this. J then taunted me, sent me texts of he and S's ""romantic"" conversations just to spite me. I ended up crying myself to sleep that night to the point I was physically sick the next day and didn't go to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, J blocks me on all social media (and my number) except Instagram. (which he simply unfollowed me.) A week later, S unfollows me on Instagram. Another friend of mine told me to check S's recent post and it was a picture of her and J. They made their relationship public, she had pictures of them kissing and they had a comment chain saying how much they loved each other. Her bio also says they got together in August. (The whole fiasco happened in September too, meaning she was cheating on me for OVER A MONTH.) S also kept posting on Snapchat and Instagram of how ""happy"" she is and how much ""love she feels"" constantly. I told my friend to stop keeping me posted cause I don't need to know all of this cause I need to move on. I also tell S to end our streak and she responds with ""Bet!"" (Which is kind of rude if you ask me.)

Our friends got divided. Some of our friends are on her and J's side and now ghost me. Most of them are on my side and are still friends with her as well as I, but they aren't as close with her. Our friend group actually divided from this. (Also I found out S's parents hate me and I'm banned from being near her.) 

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn't do anything...! I forgive her and J, even though it's INCREDIBLY hard to do so. However, I want to say thank you. I feel a huge weight was lifted on my back. I moved on from S, but not what she did. I do have an increased amount of trust issues and depression though. I am very hurt, but I know things will get better. I'm actually going to see a therapist tomorrow about all this. 

I've also started seeing someone new and she has been very helpful and patient with me regarding all of this.

But once again, thank you to everyone in this subreddit. You guys were very supportive and even though I'm not 100% better yet, I do feel a lot better and more free. You guys are awesome =)

UPDATE: It‚Äôs getting even harder to move on because I keep being reminded of it. Since their relationship is now public, a lot of my friends keep going up to me and asking ‚ÄúOMG S AND J ARE DATING?! Are you okay? What happened with you two?‚Äù And I‚Äôm like UGHHHH

t3_dlluc9,How do you hint to a girl that you're into her?,"I've been hanging out with this girl for a little bit now in college. We're really good friends, but I also have feelings for her. I was planning on eventually just being straight up and telling her I have feelings for her and hoping things don't get too awkward (wouldn't mind staying friends since regardless we're pretty close), but now I don't feel like I can do that. I say that because this one other guy that hangs out with us has been coming on really strong to her, such as spending every possible minute with her and writing her notes. She's told me that she feels kind of awkward around him especially when letting him sleep over in her dorm since he clearly really likes her, but then said she's fine with me staying over and stuff since she doesn't get the vibe that I'm into her. Now I kind of want to subtly hint I'm into her just to test the waters I guess. How would I do that? Or am I pretty much stuck as a friend? 

tl;dr: like one of my close friends, was gonna tell her i'm into her but now i'm not sure since another kid tried to and got shut down and she feels kinda awkward around him. need ways to kind of hint i have feelings for her without being awkward",relationship_advice
t3_dlp7ng,How to navigate my (32f) relationship with my sister (30f) as her husband (31m) struggles with alcoholism,"This is a cross-post from r/alcoholism. It hasn't gained any traction there, but I'm desperate for advice. 

My sister, Lisa, is married to an alcoholic. We found out a few years ago when he had a seizure during a vacation. They had been together for a while already at that point. Since then, they've gotten married and bought a house. He has gone to detox and gaslighted Lisa constantly regarding his drinking. He's never stopped. Every time anyone in my family or his family sees him, the stench of alcohol is undeniable. My sister will lie and say that he smells like liquor because he smokes cigars and drinks Sprite. This is the level of denial we are dealing with. She gets angry and refuses to speak to anyone who tries to open a dialogue regarding her husband.

A few days ago, her husband suffered a Grand Mal seizure at home and nearly died. He would have died if she wasn't home and able to immediately call an ambulance. He's not stable yet and heavily sedated in a hospital. She claims that he just relapsed for a couple of days while she was out of town for work and says that's what caused his current situation. No one, including his parents, believe her.

In the past few years, my sister has gone from being bright, bubbly, and ambitious to mean, angry, and vindictive. She chronically excuses her husband's behavior and always paints him as a victim. He's had so many opportunities to get sober, and I know that it's not easy at all. I just can't keep seeing her constantly treating him as a victim and refusing to acknowledge that he has problems. 

On top of all of this, my sister has worked really hard to forge a career in the industry she's wanted to work in since she was a child. She's missed so much work due to her husband's issues that I'm worried her job is in jeopardy. Her husband works a dead end job. He's told her he's going back to school to get a degree in business a few times. The last time he did so, he paid for a semester and never went to classes. He never told her that he wasn't going to class, she just found out when she came home and he was there once. He doesn't seem to have any desire to better himself in any way, and she keeps providing him with the excuses to continue burying himself in his alcoholism. 

I'm at a loss. His life is tanking and he's dragging her down with him. Normally I'd advise people to just talk and be honest, but my sister absolutely refuses to listen to anyone and just starts raging whenever any attempt at a conversation is made.

What can I do to help someone in my sister's situation? I get that she loves him, but this has been going on for years and has only gotten worse. Now he potentially has brain damage and may never be himself again. If I could just get her to have an open dialogue about their situation I would be happy.

Please share any stories or advice you might have. There's so much information on dealing with someone struggling with addiction, but not as much for handling a significant other who is in deep denial. She refuses to go to counseling and has also gotten angry at the suggestion of going to an Al-Anon meeting. I need more options because I can't keep watching her cling to this sinking ship.

TLDR: My sister is in denial about the depths of her husband's alcoholism. She rages and yells whenever anyone tries to talk to her. I need help in coming up with ways to help her through this time and to see that her denial is only helping his addiction deepen.",relationship_advice

t3_dlp5f0,Fwb trouble?,"Me (23F) and him (20M) have this casual fwb thing going on since february (a long time for casual!). We both don't want a relationship, we had a good conversation about that in the beginning and sometimes we check to see if we are still on the same page. 
I really like this guy, the sex is great and i feel comfortable with him. We also agreed to tell the other when/if we had sex with someone else.

I knew this day was coming, but a week ago he came over and told me he had sex with someone. I really didn't know what to think about that because it is a new situation for me. We watched some netflix, my thoughts go to this other girl and it is kinda upsetting me (visualising it.. ugh). Eventually i say (literally) fuck it i want him and we have sex.

The past week i thought a lot about it. The next day after seeing him i was really upset, had a shit day. But for the first time in my life (lol) i accepted every emotion i have about it. I think about it some more days and yesterday i reached the conclusion that for now i didn't care that he fucked 1 girl in half a year, and that i just have to see what he does (and mostly how often) in the future. 

So i ask him if he wanted to hangout this week. He says that he's mentally burdened with the situation and want to talk to me about it in a neutral place. I say sure, unless you already made a decision, then you can tell me now.
He calls me, we talk for half an hour. It was a nice and good phonetalk except for 1 thing that made me pretty upset for some reason (i cried afterwards): he wants us to see us every once in a couple of weeks.
Since february we saw eachother every 1,5 weeks. 

In the phonecall i ask him if he felt the need for other girls more now that he had sex with another girl. He didn't like the question but i wanted to know. He said ""yeah kinda""

So i guess i'm upset because i'm used to seeing him quite often and now i need to keep myself in check and think about ""oh no i have to wait a couple of weeks before i can ask him"". I guess it's such a difference to me that it is upsetting. I really like having sex with him, but i guess he prefers to have a lot less sex with me so he will feel more free to have sex with other girls. 

Ugh i just don't know what to do with this situation. I don't want to loose him and the great sex and i don't know how often it will happen that he fucks someone else (he will be telling me that) so do i just have to wait until i think ""okay thats too much girls"" and text him every couple of weeks to hang out? 

I'm sorry but i feel shitty right now about it and i could use some others opinions!

t3_dlikfc,Is it wrong that I (23f) love being babied by my husband (32m)?,"*TL;DR: My husband constantly dotes on me and treats me like a child, I willingly play it up and enjoy it. Acquaintances think it's unhealthy. What do you think?*

First, I know the age gap is large, but we don't mind. I met him at university (I started uni at 15) and we were very close friends until I turned 18, which is when I asked him out. He did *not* make a move on a barely legal girl, I'm the one who waited until I was an adult to pursue him, and he was very responsible and made sure I was 100% aware of the age gap before he even agreed to give a date a chance. We've been together 5 years, married 1, and things are really great!

The reason why I make this post is because several friends and relatives have expressed worries about my relationship, although I don't agree with them, so I'm curious to have input from unrelated third parties.

Essentially, the problem is that my husband ""babies me."" He constantly dotes on me and treats me like the most precious and fragile thing in existence. He showers me with gifts (often childish things like plushies, frilly clothes, toys...), cuddles and attention. He also always looks out for me and is always telling me it's okay if I just want to lay down on the couch and watch a TV show instead of working or doing chores around the house. He kisses my forehead a lot and calls me his ""pretty little girl."" He gives me piggyback rides and sometimes just grabs me under the armpits and swings me around for laughs (he's 6'4"", I'm 5'2""). He babytalks to me like someone else would to a pet. I actually often get mistaken for his daughter when we're out and acting in public like we do in private.

For context, I grew up in a very strict, no-nonsense household where I was constantly expected to outperform my peers, I was constantly signed up for extra-curricular activities, Sunday schools, study groups, etc. I don't think I ever hugged my own parents even once.

In contrast, my husband is the softest, kindest, most gentle soul I have ever met. When I'm with him, I feel what I imagine is child-like wonder and amusement, it's like I'm free of constraints. I act the part of a younger girl too, on purpose and because I want to, because I find it comforting. Fake pouting, talking in disjointed sentences, adjusting my body language to be more immature and energetic. I find it fun and liberating, and we're constantly in good spirits when we're acting that way with each other.

The only ""downside"" of this situation is that I noticed he grew to be more protective of me in a way that vaguely removes my agency. He insists to drive me places and stay by my side as much as he can, because he gets worried when I drive or am alone outside of our house. When we have to take a decision together, he tends to step up and decide alone until I remind him that, hey, I exist (it doesn't help that most people talk to him directly because they assume he's my dad). Thing is, my husband is very apologetic and willing to step down and let me do my thing as soon as I ask him to, he never tries to *force* me into a position of helplessness. He will automatically head for the driver's seat, but if I say ""I want to drive today,"" he will not fight back and just hand me the keys. If I want a night out with friends, he will get up to come with me, but if I say I want to go without him, he'll ask me to send him a text every hour to make sure I'm fine, then he'll hug me and tell me to have fun. He also never expressed any distaste for the fact I have  Master's degree and a full-time job, although he made sure I know I *could* leave my job if I wanted and he'd be happy to support me as his stay-at-home wife.

Several friends from university and before, who knew me as a pretty stern and serious gal who only wore professional, black outfits, have expressed worry now that I'm a more childish woman who wears a lot of pink. My parents, in particular, have constantly tried to break us up (I don't have much of a relationship left with them, nowadays). I hear that others think my marriage is unhealthy, and I can see their arguments, but I genuinely feel happier than ever before and I think it's not a problem.

t3_dlfm8h,Getting a taste of my own medicine. I need an antidote.,"I'm not sure if this belongs on this sub, but here goes...

I've been married for almost 6 years, and I was happy most of the time. I say ""most"" because all marriages have little bumps along the way... I got lazy at times, got upset with her because I wanted to play video games instead of help clean the house. Im a chaotic person like that with no time tables. It'll get done when it gets done so to speak. 

Turned out that's not her love language. Mine has always been the words and touch. Hers were acts of service and gifts. I got lax on doing that for her, which in turn turned her colder to me when it came to validating my feelings.

That's when I started talking to people of the opposite sex on snapchat. I was seeking what she wasn't providing, after months of no kinds words from her and further wrought by my resistance to do things for her. The conversations started innocent enough. I still felt happily married when I talked to them about life, kids, and the like...

Then something happened.

The girls started talking affectionately to me. They started telling everything I wanted to hear from my wife but couldn't. It was like a drug for me. I kept going back to them more and more. Needless to say, I eventually got busted.

Long story short, my wife and I are now separated, and it kills me. Since then, I've seen the error in my ways, albeit much too late on most days it feels like. She's grown numb toward me, but she still listens to sad music and tells me that she loves me.

Then yesterday happens.

I got lonely and saw some of her Facebook posts and noticed a guy commenting frequently. In my insecurity, I asked her about it, to which she replied ""he's a friend from work. Lol he tried asking me out a few weeks ago"". My heart sank. Like, my soul was crushed. I asked her if she was gonna go on a date with him and she said she was thinking about it.

I lost cabin pressure...

I felt empty, numb, angry, hurt, enraged, remorse, and sorrow. Then it hit me... The thought of her going on a movie date with this guy, her holding his hand, maybe even kissing him after the date... I felt this pit in my stomach. This is what I put her through... This is what it feels like to destroy something and truly feel the consequences.

I want to get back together with her. I want to hold on to hope. I want to show her that she means everything to me. I lost sight of that because she didn't give me the validation and emotional support I needed, due to my inability to be attentive to what she wanted. I never wanted to date the snapchat women, never had any intention to...

That doesn't justify, nor excuse what I did to her.

I called her and told her that going on this date would kill me inside, that I didn't want her to do it. She didn't say she would or wouldn't.

I'm scraping by without her love, probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I chose her for a reason. I'm realizing what I had now that she's gone and I want nothing more than to repent, change and be better for her and my family. I'm not ready to stop fighting for her. Deep down, I don't think she's ready to let me go yet, either.

Are there any survivors that have experienced this, and what did you do to change and repent? Did it work? Or do I need to swallow my pride, cut my losses and set her free?

I love her so much and I would do anything to get her back. If there's a glimmer of hope, I'll keep fighting. Please help...",relationship_advice

I (M17) am together with my Girlfriend (F17, same Grade as me in School) for about two weeks now ( Time we dated + Time we spent as an official couple = 1 Month) However, things really changed from the time we commited to a relationship. Before that point, she really often texted me first ( I think it would be good to mention that she wasnt the only one who always texted first, i did as well, but not as often as her ), really put in effort to keep to conversation going and we texted a lot, and with a lot, i really mean a lot, but now, the conversations are significantly shorter, im always the one who initiates the conversation, im the one who carries \*almost\* the whole conversation and i have a feeling that if i wouldnt initiate the conversation, we would chat for that day, and for example today, we talked about our date on the weekend and she didnt respond for a very long time, but had been online and didnt even write me ""Good Night, I Love you"" as usual ( i know the last thing with not writing me Good Night might not really be important but i wanted to mention it as well for you to get the picture) We see eachother almost every day in school, kiss eachother when encountering eachother in the hallways, cafeteria and in school/on dates everythings fine but the problem mentioned above worries me a lot :/

I really like when shes around me, and she always tells me the same. We laugh a lot, kiss etc but the things mentioned above really bother me.

I‚Äôve slowly been moving on thanks to my current partner, but lately she‚Äôs been weird. I‚Äôll preface this, we both have our Snap locations active at all times.

Yesterday, I decided to text her about plans for the weekend (a road trip), she was really vague and answered very sparsely. I offered to pick her up from work since we hadn‚Äôt seen each other all day, and she said ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I asked her ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you up to?‚Äù around 8:15pm and she didn‚Äôt respond until 9:50pm.

When she finally responded, she told me she was ‚ÄúRelaxing.‚Äù I then asked her why she didn‚Äôt want me to pick her up, she said she wanted to walk. I then brought up her location, and she told me she was at a ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs house.‚Äù I asked why she didn‚Äôt just tell me that instead of saying ‚ÄúI wanted to walk,‚Äù and she responded with a simple ‚Äúokay.‚Äù 

I feel like I‚Äôm being super controlling and that‚Äôs not okay, I know. But her story weirds me out and is spotty. Her location is off now, which is fair.

Why would she not just tell me she‚Äôs with hanging out with someone else for almost two hours and that they were getting her from work? Why would she leave out some pretty basic information?

t3_dlia4v,I don't know how to like somebody less,"I feel like being a hopeless romantic is damaging me in the long-term. I always know how I feel about someone in a relatively short period of time--if I don't like someone, I'll move on, but if I do, I'm all in. If I truly like someone, I don't know how to hold back.

Then the guy leaves and I'm left feeling 1) dumb for falling for someone again and 2) slightly inadequate since my feelings weren't reciprocated. I can't tell if I'm a terrible judge of character, or I'm somehow exclusively dating inconsiderate assholes, or if it's me.

t3_dlopa8,I'm trapped to choose who. I (F 26). One guy (22 m). Another( M 32),"Hi, actually I'm confused. I've trapped in a bad situation.  I found one of my classmate has crush on me.  In somehow I like him. 
One day we were standing in campus with my friends. I saw he was standing far but was staring at me. He is truly shy. I said join us. And he did and stand beside me. We were talking but he was  just listening and didn't say anything. Sometimes he touched me but pretended that was accidentally!!! Suddenly I saw another of my classmate who had crush on me too but he wasn't shy at all. He said something that was exactly related to the talking with my friends while he wasn't there that moment. I really was shocked. And after that showed some sexual signs that I want to have sex with you and wanted to kiss me but that friend didn't saw these thing. 
I suspected because I had already seen that he talked about our talking with my friends when the shy guy was with us. And when they see each other I see that the second guy helps him to communicate with me and that is so strange for me.actually he talks with me in an ambivalent way that I find what he mean but the shy guy thinks he is helping him in a way to getting close to me.  
I suspected that the shy guy had asked him for helping him to be with me because the second guy had already in touch with me and the second guy is ditching him but I'm not sure and I really confused.
 Any tip? By the way and unfortunately I have crush on both of them and I don't know what should I do?  Choose one of them so who one?  Or quit because this is creepy and I shouldn't be greedy. 
TL;DR:I've trapped in a situation between two classmate that we have crush. I have two problem:1. choosing which of them. 2:I'm suspected that one of them is kicking another guy out in a strange way.",relationship_advice
t3_dllbhg,My boyfriend wants to move out but still stay together?,"I‚Äôm not super active on reddit, mostly just a lurker. My boyfriend (22M) and I (23F) have been dating 4 years since a few days ago, we have been living together for a year and a half. We living in a house with my Grandfather and two younger brothers. My brothers and I were in foster care and my grandfather took custody of us I primarily care for him and my younger brothers. 

A little context, before he moved in he was constantly at my place, he begged for us to let him move in all the time but I was worried that would be a lot of commitment and if something went wrong then it would go really wrong. After fighting with his dad he came to me crying saying he couldn‚Äôt live with his dad anymore and to please let him move in. (His dad wasn‚Äôt abusive or anything just kind of a dick) so even though I was scared we let him move in. This kind of thing has been common place in our relationship, he pushed me for months to date him even when I said no, he held me down and kissed me not long after I said no and it scared me so much I started to cry he felt bad and apologized. A few months went by and he was improving as a person. So I gave it a shot and we started dating everything was good except I really felt pressured into sex (I was a virgin and even though I‚Äôm not religious I still wanted to wait until the right person came along) I felt guilty after we had sex but overtime as our relationship grew the guilt subsided. I don‚Äôt have a particularly high sex drive but he does and he always wants to mess around which results in either him being frustrated I don‚Äôt want to, or me doing it when I don‚Äôt want to. I realize that sounds pretty dysfunctional but he was good at taking no for an answer unfortunately me feeling guilty about not doing stuff is what the issue was


. We hardly fight and when we do we talk it out, the majority of our relationship he was the most loving and caring person but the last few months something has changed. He stopped looking at me the same way, talking to me the same way, complimenting me and generally being affectionate. 80% of the time these past few he would only say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù if I said it first. I brought it up with him several times mentioning it just felt like we are friends sleeping in the same bed, and that he hasn‚Äôt been his self with me. He would push it off and say he didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. 


Well last night he drops a bombshell on me saying he wants to move out alone, then he rolled over and went to sleep. I stayed up all night crying, and thinking it over while he slept. This morning he said it‚Äôs not like we would be breaking up, he just wants to do his own thing while still being in a relationship. He wouldn‚Äôt give me anymore reasoning than that. I said that it feels like we‚Äôd be moving backwards and I don‚Äôt understand why he wants to leave me. He just answers ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù to everything, I said I feel like if he moves out we can‚Äôt continue the relationship, he knows I can‚Äôt leave my family, and him leaving just feels like he is putting a stop in our future. He doesn‚Äôt want to live here, I can‚Äôt leave, how are we supposed to move forward with marriages/kids/etc. 


I also tried to explain how hard it would be for me to be in my house without him, like the loss of him by my side at night etc. It didn‚Äôt seem to phase him, he was like ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs over then, I wanted to wait until I saved up enough‚Äù am I wrong for feeling used? Or feeling like him moving out was a step towards breaking up anyways? To top it off after arguing for a bit he basically said he felt like it was moving towards this anyways that we have just been friends for a while and he would still like to stay friends if we broke up. I ask him why he lied to me then every time I brought up how things have change and why not discuss it? And can you guess what his answer was?  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 


I really do love him, am I wrong for not giving him the benefit of the doubt and continuing our relationship even if he left? He isn‚Äôt willing to try and stay while we work out our issues either.  He just left to work saying he needs to think...  I realize he sounds really bad here but honestly we‚Äôve never really had any issues until now. I feel jaded and tricked and I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to be in another relationship again. Like no one else will love me. That‚Äôs not on him though, it‚Äôs on me, I‚Äôm plus size, my family situation is difficult and I don‚Äôt have time to socialize much, how can I move on?

She‚Äôs turning so religious it‚Äôs scaring me. And she kept it a secret for the entire time until I overlooked these... bible notes. I am in no way shape or form spiritual or religious. I hate hearing about it or being reminded it‚Äôs a thing. And she knew that since day one. 

But what she didn‚Äôt know about me until overlooking my text messages with my cousin is that I go both ways. And honestly I‚Äôd rather be with a man at this point in my life.

t3_dlok8q,I (24F) am uncomfortable with my boyfriends‚Äô (25M) friend,"So this has been simmering for a while and I‚Äôve asked multiple friends for advice and I just want all the advice I can get at the moment -

My boyfriend struggles with depression and low self esteem. He comes from a broken household where he was mentally abused as a kid and it has left him feeling like he isn‚Äôt good enough. He has gone to therapy for it, and is somewhat of a compulsive liar. His therapist has told him that this is because of his low self esteem where he lies to make himself seem better, but really it has the opposite effect as people generally don‚Äôt like liars. 

Now, my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt tell any ‚Äúserious‚Äù lies, just small stupid stuff to try and make himself seem more impressive and more whatnot. He‚Äôs told me he quit smoking cigarettes, and when I found a box hidden in our bedroom I said ‚Äúso how long have you been done with cigarettes again?‚Äù To which he replied ‚Äúalmost 2 months‚Äù and I said ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt touched them?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúnope haven‚Äôt bought them since‚Äù. I pulled out the box I found and his face looked like he saw a ghost. We had a very serious conversation about how this lie was unacceptable and honestly made me trust him much less. He apologized, said he lied because he promised he would stop smoking but couldn‚Äôt help it and he knows I don‚Äôt like smoking so he doesn‚Äôt want me to think differently. Truth of the matter is though, I now think of him as somewhat of a dishonest person. 

Cue to the next big point - my boyfriend was in a previous abusive relationship with another girl who cheated and lied to him and it obviously devastated him. Immediately after the breakup with his ex, he went into a rebound and hooked up with another girl (Olivia) who helped him a lot and he developed feelings for her. She told him she just wanted to be friends and she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. So they‚Äôve remained friends since. 

Now I have been in the picture for almost 2 years and we are considering moving in together, but he still occasionally hangs out with Olivia. They text and Snapchat alllll the time, and I‚Äôll be honest it makes me a little suspicious. I‚Äôve told him about this, especially considering his past lies and he‚Äôs profusely assured me that he would never cheat as he knows how horrible it feels and that he loves me and is just friends with Olivia. To further try and calm my suspicions, he arranged a coffee date for all 3 of us. We met up and honestly - their interaction was weird and awkward. The conversation was awkward and it stumbled around a lot, almost feeling forced. 

We stayed for 2 hours and after leaving she immediately texted him and I saw it pop up on his notifications as we were driving home - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Ana likes me‚Äù. What does Olivia care if I like her or not? I‚Äôm not dating her, or even friends with her so it shouldn‚Äôt matter. Later that night he must‚Äôve said something because she responded with ‚ÄúHonestly I think it‚Äôs a bit immature she thinks our friendship is weird. I‚Äôve been best friends with one of my exes and he supports me so much, but she is your girlfriend so that‚Äôs up to you‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm completely suspicious because what did he say to her and what is up to him? 

I personally do think it‚Äôs weird to remain close friends with exes or old hookups, as one party typically still has some sort of feeling for the other. Once you go sexual with someone, you‚Äôve crossed a boundary that cannot be uncrossed. Exes are exes for a reason. 

Some of my friends believe he still harbors feelings for Olivia and is waiting for her to be ‚Äúready‚Äù for a relationship and then he will leave me and go be with her. Other friends told me to believe him that he isn‚Äôt cheating and that he does love me if he says so. I don‚Äôt know what to believe and it‚Äôs starting to make me anxious. Please let me know what to do or if any of you have been in similar situations and how it worked or didn‚Äôt work. 

Thank you

tl:dr - boyfriend was abused as a kid and is now a compulsive liar to make up for low self esteem. After his ex cheated on him he became fwb with Olivia who just wanted to be friends after he confessed feelings for her. Now they hangout and text all the time and we all met up and it was awkward and their interaction was strange. He insists he loves me and Olivia is just a friend even though she sent some weird texts. What do I do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlh5xq,Am I being emotionally manipulated?,"Please help I‚Äôm so messed up over this rn..probably will be long I‚Äôm sorry.. Background...Last year I had a really bad mental health breakdown where I was really suicidal for months and my girlfriend of 1 year was there for me through it all and I imagine it made her really upset to deal with me and see me that way. I felt better and we took a vacation together and she seemed irritated and we argued the whole time, and with her birthday party she bosses me around the whole time setting up and barely acknowledged me, and finally I had to cancel on a vacation with some of our mutual friends cause of financial reasons and she got very very mad and did a complete 180. She seemed sick of me I apologized and asked her what I could do and she told me nothing and she was just going to be mad and she didn‚Äôt know when she would stop being mad. It made me emotionally feel really shitty to the point where I was starting to fall back into the deep hole of depression that I broke up with her.

We were broken up for a month but live with a bunch of our friends on campus so when school was back, we got back together. Now, my gf seems depressed. She barely talks to me and told me she wants me to pry answers out of her even though when I ask she gives me the silent treatment and I have to pry cause ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the way she grew up‚Äù. She watches Netflix allllll day by herself and doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge me when I walk in. She is barely doing her schoolwork and gets so stressed out she seems to take her anger out on me, amongst other issues she probably has going on I‚Äôm unaware of. She said something pretty hurtful the other day and told me she hates when I talk and play video games and gets mad when I play them but yet spends hours on her phone playing candy crush... she also seems kinda untrusting and will always ask who I‚Äôm talking to or go on my phone ..when we‚Äôre around others she‚Äôll mention how I broke up with her and it makes me feel more terrible than I already do . It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs hot and cold with affection and I barely get her attention to begin with. I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells cause I constantly feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong and being put down but she would probably say I‚Äôm being dramatic. She literally says she is toxic and I should leave her, and that she‚Äôs terrible and treats me awful but then seems sad about it so I feel guilty..then turns around and says she wants a promise ring then says she just doesn‚Äôt know what she wants..I‚Äôm just confused...but sometimes Im scared to be around her out of fear that she will reject my kiss, not give me an ounce of attention, won‚Äôt seem interested in my day, won‚Äôt say yes to a date idea I have, etc.



My problem is I feel terrible cause she was there for me and probably felt the same when I had depression but I feel like the difference is I never treated her horribly when I was severely depressed.. yeah she was probably upset but honestly I always apologized to her and told her I would try to get better and feel better and wish I felt better and I felt like a burden and at the time , I didn‚Äôt know what to do except talk to her for those couple of those suicidal months, I was desperate . I still asked her was she okay, I asked her how her day was, went and got her things, but hey everyone‚Äôs depression is different I guess... should I stick it out because she seems depressed and I should be there for her or is this just emotional manipulation at this point regardless of depression?",relationship_advice
t3_dlohgm,My GF is suddenly acting different,"Our relationship for almost two years has been near flawless, aside from small bumps here and there every relationship goes through. She‚Äôs always been on the needy side, always wanting attention and knowing all about me which was never really an issue for me. But the past couple months she‚Äôs been acting really different, almost like a different person

It started mostly mild; she stopped being as needy, even asking me to give her more space which was strange for her, but I obliged.

Then she started doing weird stuff

We‚Äôre logged into each others instagrams, it was a sign of trust in each other when we first started dating. I never paid it much mind until recently I noticed new messages from someone she dropped immediately after we started dating. For reference purposes, let‚Äôs call him Sam. It was innocent enough but then when he asked what she‚Äôs been doing, she told Sam to text her on iMessage, and there hasn‚Äôt been anything since.

She always has had open access to my phone as I had nothing to hide, but has never let me on hers unless she can see what I‚Äôm doing. I never really went on it anyways, but I noticed while driving she changed from leaving the phone in the cup holder, to never letting it leave the door on her side of the car.(this includes even to charge it, she‚Äôs let it die on multiple occasions by refusing to move it)

She‚Äôs also been FaceTiming this guy, let‚Äôs call him Jerry. Jerry was a friend she had before we started dating. She told me about him early on and how she had no interest in jerry, and cut him off as well. But around the same all this started, they started texting and then FaceTiming, so avidly to the point he calls her Atleast four times every time we‚Äôre together (the most times being eight, when I spent the whole day with her).

Am I justified in feeling suspicious or am I just being paranoid? I honestly can‚Äôt say myself.",relationship_advice
t3_dlogw2,"I [18M}Found out one of my best friends[19M] love interest is sleeping with another guy, should I tell him?"," Before you say yes that is what friends do, it is a little more complicated and I am not sure where to begin. I have known this guy for a long time, and we worked on an indie video game project together while in high school. He is a bit of a geek but once you get to know him he is really cool guy. He is super intelligent and I can talk about subjects with him that would fly way over most peoples heads. However, he has some issues with women and finding a romantic partner. In high school he fell in unrequited love with this woman who had no interest in him whatsoever. Actually he initially had a friendship with her but he ruined that by practically stalking her. His interest was romantic all along but she was only willing to be friends with him, and he thought because of that he had a chance with her. I was honest with him and told him she wasn't interested in him and to move on but he was in serious denial and wouldn't listen to me.   


Anyway, he graduated a year before me and I graduated this year. By coincidence we are attending different Universities but in the same area, so he is in his second year of college across town and I am a freshman. He didn't have much luck with women his first year of college either. He even tried online dating(Tinder and OKCupid) for several months and got nothing. I looked at his profile for him and it looked fine to me so I dunno what the problem was really, but his experience is one of the reasons I never bothered with OLD either.   


When school first started up and before I got a girlfriend I volunteered to be his wingman to see if we could change things. Unfortunately that didn't work out for him either. When we went out girls would just walk past him like he was invisible and come up and talk to me. I thought in a normal wingman situation one girl would pair up with each guy, but that was not the case here. When girls would come up and talk I would try to introduce him too and they would say hi and stuff to be polite but then go right back to ignoring him to talk to me. It was terrible and I felt so bad for him. He did give off a shy and awkward vibe and the ladies probably picked up on that. But I don't think he is on the spectrum and he has no problem socializing and making guy friends.   


Anyway sorry for getting off track here, it is my ADD :-) So about 4 weeks ago I invited him to a party with my girlfriend and I was hoping he could maybe meet someone there. Well, he actually did meet someone there and I was at first really happy for him. He actually went on a date with her, well sort of. In his mind he thinks of me ""as the guy who can get girls"" and therefore he would be constantly asking me what his next move should be( for the record I don't think I am some dating guru at all, I am just as clueless as he is about a lot of that stuff). He went on several ""dates"" with this girl but never so much as kissed (except on the cheek). Basically platonic hugs and kisses was all he was getting. But even this made him ecstatic as he wasn't even used to this level of affection from non family. He acted like they were falling madly in love with each other even though I told him to slow down with all his future plans with her he was talking about. You would think they were getting engaged or something the way he talked about her after just a few dates(and nothing physical).   


So anyway, he somehow took my advice the wrong way and from what he told me after they went out to dinner, he asked her where they were headed in the relationship, mind you they haven't even kissed yet. She told him she was unsure and that she was still getting over her ex boyfriend whom she broke it off with a couple months prior. She was ""confused"" and her life was a mess right now, etc. When he told me this I told him that is the most idiotic thing he could have done, especially after she apparently had a good time with him that evening. I told him if he really wanted to know where he stood with her he would have to kiss her at what he felt was an appropriate time, like sitting in the car alone together after the ""date"".   


So the next time they went out he did try to kiss her when they were sitting on the couch together after their ""date"". Unfortunately she turned at the last second and gave him her cheek instead of her lips. I guess he further attempted to get physical with her but that she told him he was making her uncomfortable. He then asked her point blank why she didn't want to get physical and she told him she just got out of a bad relationship and wasn't even thinking about sex, and only saw him as a friend. She actually told him that she would understand if he didn't want to see her anymore but that she thought he was a really great guy and liked him as a friend, and he accepted being friends with her. After he told me this I told him I was very sorry but I thought that she wasn't interested and that for his sake it was time to move on. Of course he didn't listen at all and was dreaming of somehow winning her over, if he could just show how great of guy he was somehow she would fall in love with him. I told him that she already knew what a great guy he is or she wouldn't even want to be friends with him, but that she just wasn't attracted to him for whatever reason. I even suggested that if he wanted to maintain the friendship with her perhaps she could introduce him to some of her friends who might be romantically interested in him. Of course he wanted her and only her.   


So his next step was to try to win her affection by being a big spender. He had already bought her this fairly expensive piece of jewelry, but for his next ""date"" with her he decided to take her to an ultra fancy restaurant, and it would be a surprise. He did this, and because it was a surprise she under-dressed for the occasion and apparently felt embarrassed and uncomfortable about the whole situation. She offered to split the bill, as she had on previous occasions, but he refused and payed for the entire expensive affair.   


Anyway, down to the point, my girlfriend knows this other woman, not like best friends but they are in the same social circles.  I found out from my girlfriend this woman he is trying to court has been sexual with some other guy all along, the entire time they have been ""dating"". Like before I have been very blunt with him that this woman is clearly not interested and he should just move on, he is wasting time, money, and emotional energy on her when he could be dating dozens of other women and maybe find one where the romantic feelings are mutual. He asked me how many hours he should wait to contact her after this last debacle of a ""date"" and I told him never, infinity hours, move on dude.   


So my dilemma is that I am afraid if I tell him he will get angry and somehow blame me even though I am just the messenger. Worst case is I am afraid he may even attempt suicide, and if he did I would feel guilty for triggering it. He is going to get his heart broken, and by not telling him I am only delaying the inevitable. He will most likely wast more time, emotional energy and money on this woman until she gets a restraining order or something. Or if he finds out I knew all along about her secret lover he will be mad at me for not telling him when I found out. So, is it my place to tell him, or not?   


TL;DR friend has unrequited feelings for a woman who only sees him as a friend. They have hung out lots and he hopes she will fall in love with him. I just found out from my GF this woman is sleeping with another guy, should I tell my friend this and break his heart?",relationship_advice
t3_dlofuk,GF(20) and I(20M) broke up because she has no time anymore,"Never thought that I would be the one to post here, but here goes.   


Background: I met my gf when college first started, and we dated for almost two years before she decided to end things. Without being too specific, she joined a professional coed frat that required so much of her time that we would barely see each other or even talk on messenger; this happened in a span of a week. Knowing this would take too much of her time for a while, she decided to end things in person because she thought that she couldn't commit enough time for me, and thought it was unfair to me.

This was my second breakup, but safe to say my first heartbreak. I haven't cried like this since I was a child. I completely understand why she did it, but I feel so sad that it had to end because of this. I tell myself that if things are meant to be, we'll be back together. I have no hard feelings for her at all, and hope she does well. I'm thankful for my amazing friends that have supported me, but I just wanted some advice from unbiased people.

The name calling has stopped, thankfully. And he apologised to me. He also sent another long email to my mother to apologise for his behaviour and tried to explain that he just cares for me and is worried about me. One of the reasons he said he worries is because of my promiscuous past.

t3_dlhx4h,I (28f) finally want to talk about a mutual traumatic experience with my friend (27M) but it's two years after the fact. Would this be unfair?,"I'm in an emotionally tricky situation with a once-close friend. I'll give some context but writing this down has been more difficult and emotional than I expected. I hope it's not too rambly.

In early 2017, my friend (then-roommate) and I were both at home when two men tried to break into the house. They threw outside furniture and bricks through the windows, broke off our door handle trying to get inside and screamed at us. Having an adult man scream at you in pure violent rage is an experience I would not wish upon my worst enemy. My friend and I hid in a bedroom. I was so frightened I didn't even think of calling the cops until afterwards. Honestly, I was mostly concerned with trying not to wet myself. Thankfully, the men left after a short time and never gained entry to the house.

It's not particularly relevant, but we never found out why they were there. I assume it was random and opportunistic (our windows were visible from the street) or an unfortunate case of the wrong address (ie. a domestic or drug-related thing).

In the immediate aftermath, I was manically happy. I giggled and rambled out loud and wandered from room to room. My friend reacted quite differently. He was subdued and cried. I sat next to him but I felt awkward and disconnected and I wasn't helpful at all. I wish so much that I could do that part differently.

The next day, we both moved out of that sharehouse into separate accommodations. At that time we did not speak about our experience, only about the practicalities around it - moving out, talking to the cops, etc.  Our relationship became distant and we only spoke every few months -  if that.

I'm not proud of this next part. About a year later, the event randomly came up in in a social setting with one other close friend. Our recollections diverged in several minor details - for example, which rooms we went into in which order while trying to hide, who made the decision to hide in the final bedroom and whether he got a knife from the kitchen. He became angry/curt when I challenged some of his recollections. I played the reasonable party and tried not to be visibly emotional but I felt equally rattled and annoyed by his recollections being different from my own and didn't compromise in any way. It turned into an argument. The other party agreed with me that he was being angry/unreasonable (specifically in comparison to me) and then asked us to drop it because it was making her uncomfortable.

I deeply regret challenging his recollections because I remembered some aspects of them later - like the knife - which I now remember him grabbing after I thought they left. Also, my memory of the event was so bad I couldn't tell the cops what the men had been saying half an hour after it'd been screamed at me. I see now that memories are weird and fallible. I wish I hadn't been so dismissive and hadn't leveraged his emotional reaction to 'win' the argument.

The event also changed my life. I hit rock bottom and for the next year or so I made a solid attempt at eating and drinking myself to death. I jumped at every loud noise and had nightmares of men getting inside the house.

But I've been sober and happy since July 2018. I'm also fucking terrified. The event was such a small trauma in terms of what other people have been through but I feel like I glimpsed my mortality. I saw for a moment how random life is and how quickly everything can go to shit. At the same time, now I can see how precious life is.

I  want to talk to him about the event: both to apologise for my complete inadequacy in the short and long term aftermath and to ask him if he still thinks about it at all. If it affected his outlook on life at all.

We live in different cities and usually see each other around the holidays. We are on good terms and have had positive interactions since the above incidents.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on a) whether I should bring it up at all b) if so how? I worry that it might be something he doesn't want to remember or talk about and that this is mostly about my feelings. And that he might not trust me to talk about it with him after I was so dismissive. And also that maybe it barely affected him at all and he will think I'm being ridiculous. And that though I kind of want to do it in person, that doing so would ruin any event we were at.

I think that's it. I'm happy to answer any questions if that helps.",relationship_advice
t3_dlocfr,Shall I confront my partner about what I found when I snooped on their phone?,"Shall I confront my partner about what I found when I snooped on their phone

I snooped on my partners Facebook and found some very crappy things (don‚Äôt wanna mentioned what they were but it was not faithful) he did to me in 2016. We broke up for a while because there was problems with him cheating and got back together at the end of 2017 because things had rekindled. He‚Äôs not cheated on me ever again and our relationship is an actual loving, adult relationship. I guess we needed to year apart to grow up. But recently I couldn‚Äôt help myself but to snoop. I hate myself for it because I‚Äôm just not the type of person to go behind his back like this. But I found out something that he easily could‚Äôve told me he did and he chose not to. 

I don‚Äôt know whether to confront him about this or if it‚Äôll make things bad because I had snooped. Technically it happened in a past relationship and the one we have now is so perfect. 

I just need major advice right now. I‚Äôm so ashamed to have snooped and I don‚Äôt want him to think I do it all the time. But at the same time I kinda want to confront him about this. The other argument is that could this lead to a break up when things are going so well right now. I don‚Äôt want to break up because I know he‚Äôd never cheat again. He‚Äôs made up for it the last few years. But when he came clean to me about cheating I don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt just mention this thing too. I suppose there‚Äôs kind secrets and hurtful truths. 

Any advice would be great.

t3_dloc3u,"Advice on what to do if she doesn‚Äôt initiate a conversation over text, but when face to face its the opposite?","Oh look. The classic ‚Äúwhat to do if she doesn‚Äôt initiate a conversation‚Äù question. Awesome! 

Eh, kind of. I know, I know. If she doesn‚Äôt initiate a conversation it can mean a few things or more.

- Not interested
- Too busy
- Not a phone person
- Talking to others
- etc.

But here‚Äôs the thing. I already kind of fucked up. Here‚Äôs the gist of it. We both work outside on the weekends. We talk a lot face to face, but for a couple weeks we barely if ever text. Then one week it picked up a shit ton. Suddenly she became really touchy, shoulder to shoulder, and for our entire 10 hr shift we non stop talked and shit. We are both pretty enthusiastic with each other and have a good time while talking. But, because I‚Äôm a dumb ass. She asked a question once saying ‚ÄúWhat would you do if I sent my Shi?‚Äù I give a safe answer, ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do?‚Äù She says she‚Äôll think about it. Following day I ask If she thought about it and she says ‚ÄúWhy do you want to see my Shi?‚Äù (Shi referring to Shit)

Not knowing what she meant by ‚Äúshi‚Äù, I assume it means ‚Äúshit‚Äù and go all in on my response. ‚ÄúCause I find you attractive.‚Äù

Nice. Okay. Let‚Äôs see where this leads.

I caught her completely off guard apparently. She asks stuff like ‚Äúyou doüëÄ?‚Äù 

I ask whether it‚Äôs good or bad I caught her off guard...she goes ‚Äúidk myself tbh‚Äù

Oooooooooof, but wait! There‚Äôs still hope. She didn‚Äôt say either. She‚Äôs possibly thinking about it. 

So. The point is. I usually initiate text convos. We only see each other on the weekends at work. My goal rn is to see if she‚Äôll initiate a convo with me in the next couple days. I honestly think she won‚Äôt. We do have some rocket fire convos a day or two after the weekend, but it dies down to a few word responses. Any advice if I should go ahead with this? What should I do if she doesn‚Äôt initiate? Is the following weekend my chance to stand out? Should I even keep pursuing this If she doesn‚Äôt initiate a convo via text?

t3_dloapu,"I'm (23f) about to go meet long distance friend (19f) I met online a month ago, is this crazy?","I was in a toxic (unofficial) relationship for over a year that I officially cut all ties with around 2 months ago.

Around the last few months when her and I were basically over I had tinder/bumble but I never met anyone nor did anyone really interest me enough in conversation to continue anything.

One night about a month ago I downloaded a gay app that was advertised to me. I saw a girl that by no means was textbook hot but she was different than I'd normally go for. I messaged her and after a few back and forths we started talking on Instagram. At this point I'd normally probably not put any effort to continue but there was something about our conversations that just seemed so normal.

Well one thing I didn't realize is the app matched me with a girl from Texas, I'm all the way in Illinois. Great, I'm now hooked on a girl that lives 20 hours from me.

I never went back on the app and her and I were talking every day from morning to night since the first day. We eventually switched to texting, we Snapchatted as well. Two weeks ago we talked on the phone for the first time and after 3 hours I knew she was someone I was started to get feelings for. The next night we stayed up till the next morning talking for 5+ hours. Talking to her has become a part of my everyday and I genuinely am myself. We've both been able to help eachother in being able to talk about our previous relationships. I've had rebounds before but she doesn't seem like that to me this time. It's really hard to keep my attention but she has.

It was never my intention to get into long distance but her and I have made it clear were starting to get feelings for eachother. So here I am, I on a limb bought a plane ticket and hotel to go visit her in a week. I feel like I'm crazy for doing this but I feel like I would rather know now if it's just a friend connection or if it's more.

Has anyone gone through or had any experiences like this? I'm a pretty spontaneous person so it's not out of the blue for me to do but I've never done any kind of long distance before. I also sometimes overthink the age gap for no reason and the fact that this was so soon after a toxic relationship.",relationship_advice
t3_dlj2dc,Moving on from a mutual divorce properly?,"Will try to keep things short. I married my first high school gf about 1.5 years ago, and we are in the process of getting a divorce. We dated for 4 years, and jumped into marriage at the age of 22/21‚Äî it ended up being pretty bad choice for both of us. We weren‚Äôt ready, and not right for eachother. I‚Äôm not perfect, I know I had my part in it, but she treated me very poorly, and I sorta detached a year into the marriage. 

Eventually asked me to leave, and go home (different state) to my family  ‚Äî I‚Äôve been very detached from them and friends because she pulled me away from them for bizarre reasons. I was here for a month, in loose communication with her and during that time, I said we need time to figure if it‚Äôs going to work + I want kids, she doesn‚Äôt. She wanted me back, but I figured it was her strict Christian parents telling her to fight for the marriage regardless of what happened. That ended up being the case. Last month, she flipped a switch and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happier than I ever have been. I think it needs to be done.‚Äù

After that, I was a wreck for about 3 or so weeks. Worst sadness I‚Äôve felt in a long time. During this, I reached out to a trusted guy friend and was able to be honest, and transparent about my part, and hers. He let me talk for hours, and just listened. A couple weeks later, still sad af, I reach out to girl who I‚Äôve always known to be honest and caring, but not good friends. I wanted outside perspectives.

Same thing ‚Äî I was honest with her about my wrongs, how she treated me, and she listened and cared deeply. We later talked a few times on the phone about it, and met up for coffee again. Fast forward a week, we end up talking in her car and she mentioned ‚ÄúI really care about you, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm the right person to talk to about this.‚Äù After trying to understand, I told her ‚ÄúI want you to know I have no angle ‚Äî I just was looking for somebody to talk to. That‚Äôs all‚Äù and she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that... it‚Äôs that I feel like I‚Äôm catching feelings for you, but you‚Äôre going through something very tough, and I want you to know my intentions are to care, and listen ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt want whatever feeling I have to get in the way.‚Äù I told her I was feeling something too, and we both agreed to keep those feelings below the surface while I deal with this.

So, after about 3 weeks of sadness, talking to my guy friend, and this lady friend, I begin to feel better after about 5 days of meeting up with this girl, and now I feel I‚Äôm catching feelings for her.  We are both very open how we are feeling, and she cannot express enough that she wants to make sure I deal with this properly, and she‚Äôs worried she‚Äôs getting in the way of that. We both agree that if these feelings grow, and dating becomes an option, nothing can happen until the divorce is final and I‚Äôm fully over my soon to be ex. 

I didn‚Äôt ask for these feelings for this girl. I had no plans on moving on, but she‚Äôs really, really sweet, kind, exciting, caring, pretty, etc. she‚Äôs always been this way as I loosely knew her through my teens, but I was in a relationship and never thought of it as a possibility. 

I guess my question is: Is this something that‚Äôs ok, and just take it slow? Or should we back off? I‚Äôm curious as to why I went from being so sad, to being so ok. I feel free, and just by listening to my self talk to others, I realized how unhappy I was in my relationship, and how unhappy she was. Or is it because I began talking to another girl? 

I don‚Äôt feel lonely. I don‚Äôt feel like I NEED to be in a relationship ‚Äî but this girl is turning out to be very fucking incredible. I just don‚Äôt want to do anything that would end up fizzling out, and then I don‚Äôt even have her as a friend. She feels the same, but these feelings are there, and they are growing for us both each time we see eachother. Once a week, maybe 2? 

Personally, I feel I‚Äôm over the relationship, and my soon to be ex is VERY over it. Everything mutual, no hard feelings between us. We both forgave eachother and accept it wasn‚Äôt meant to ever happen.

So, any advice on what should I should do? Go with it, slowly? or as much as I don‚Äôt want to, smother whatever this is?

TLDR: in the middle of divorce, reached out to friend to talk about it, ended up catching feelings for eachother. Worried that it‚Äôs too soon, and not sure if I‚Äôm actually moved on because I‚Äôm done with my ex, or because this new girl is now in my life.

So I(26m) have a coworker and friend(28f) that I've been having a lot of issues with lately. Let's call her Cat. Cat and I have been best friends for a while now. Cat here has been in a relationship with a really crappy guy(we'll call him worm) for almost 4 years now. In that 4 years, she's babysat his kid every day while he's off smoking with his friends or out all weekends for softball. She cleans, cooks, and babysits for him, pays for the truck that she bought for him, and in general pays for everything. In return, he does nothing, pays the bare minimum, and doesn't even watch his own child(did I mention the kiddo has aspergers? No? That's a thing). He ripped up and burned her valentines day card and said he did because he doesn't love her. So in general, Worm is kind of a garbage human. Which leads me to this. I left for a month or so, and when I came back, they had broken up. She stayed at her moms for a while and got an apartment shortly after. It's been rough for her, but I kept hoping she'd make some progress with herself. But she keeps getting in these spells that she desparately wants him back, only to change her mind shortly after. After a while, I told her I'm not going to watch that train wreck happen again, and that if she got back together with him, then I'm not going to be around for it. To which she told me, verbatim, that she'd drop all her friends if she could have him back. I got really pissed about that, because I don't believe you should ever abandon your friends. And especially not to go back to an abusive relationship. So, I'm currently cutting her out of my life. We still have to communicate for work, but that's the extent of it. So Reddit, in your infinite wisdom, am I in the wrong for cutting her out of my life if she goes back to Worm?",relationship_advice
t3_dlj1kb,I (29F) found something thst belongs to another girl in my boyfriend's (42M) apartment and I don't know how to react....,"
So the Saturday of the weekend before last, as in about 1.5 weeks ago, I (29F) spent the night at my boyfriend's (42M) apartment.  Of course I was sleeping in his bed, he took his usual side and I slept on the other side.  It was dark in the room but when I got into bed I took off all my jewelry and set it on the nightstand on my side.  


When I woke up in the morning, he got up first and showered and went into the kitchen to make me coffee.  While he was making my coffee I started getting up, got dressed, and went to grab my jewelry... it was light in the room now so when I went to grab my jewelry, I saw right under all my stuff, a girls hair bow that didn't belong to me.  Right in the same exact place I had taken off and set my jewelry the night before. As if another girl had done the exact same thing before me with her hair bow.


I grabbed the bow and walked into the kitchen and held it up, and said, ""What's this???""  He immediately responded with ""Isn't that yours?? I found it under the bed and I thought it was yours.""  I said no it's not and also I don't wear cheesy shit like this, and I threw it down on the table.  Then of course he was saying everything, such as he swears there's been no girls at his place in a long long long time, it probably belonged to his ex wife and got stuck in his stuff and fell out while he was unpacking (he did recently move into his apartment a couple months ago), he still finds his ex wife's stuff stuck in his things all the time, if he was trying to hide it why would it be right out on the table, etc etc. 


I was not buying it and he kept kissing me and hugging me saying I should believe him etc.  Eventually I just went and sat down at the table and drank my coffee with him, and acted like nothing was up, and then left.  Since then he has only reached out to me 2 times, both times I gave him very cold responses so I'm sure he knows I'm mad and is avoiding me.  I have a feeling he'll be up my ass soon though, and I don't know how I should respond.


We have had the talk and agreement that we are not sleeping with other people, especially because we are having unprotected sex.  So if he was with someone else, not only is it a heart break, but it was not fair and totally disgusting to disrespect me and put my health at risk like that.  I feel very hurt and also upset because we have been friends for years before we ever started hooking up, and I don't want to believe that he would lie to me and do something like that.


I don't know what I should do.  This seems like a pretty obvious scenario- I don't want to be an idiot and ignore what happened and try to make everything ok in my head.  But I'm wondering should I give him a chance and believe him since this is the first time anything like this has happened, and because he's been my friend for years before this?  Should I give him the benefit of the doubt this one time and trust him because he has earned some of my trust over the years?  Maybe this was just an unfortunate mistake and he's telling the truth.... he did just move into his apartment a couple months ago so it's possible some things are a mess, and he was married before so it's possible that some of his ex wife's stuff was mixed in... but I don't know.  I don't want to be a fool.  The fact that the hair bow was on the opposite nightstand of his usual side of the bed, right in the exact spot I took my stuff off, is just flashing red lights to me. 


I don't know how to talk to him about this all or what I should do the next time I see him or talk to him.  I really need some other opinions and advice.  Thanks all.

t3_dlo4xl,I think my friend has an eating disorder,"She‚Äôs obsessed with loosing weight because she doesn‚Äôt like the way she looks. She wants to look slimmer. I know BMI isn‚Äôt a perfect metric but I don‚Äôt want to post her height and weight so instead I‚Äôll disclose that she has a BMI of 22. She calorie counts by weighing out her food. She recently went to a dietician who measured her body composition using the SECA scale which also provides BMR. Her BMR is around 1400 calories and she was trying to eat 1200 calories per day but the dietician said she was under eating because BMR is 1400 and she burned an extra ~500 calories a day in exercise. Dietician said to eat 1400 calories per day to loose weight (deficit of 500 calories) or 1900 to maintain. But she struggles with the idea of eating more than 1200. She also has low blood pressure and is tired all the time and showed me how big her lunches typically are (they‚Äôre tiny, like size of my fist). Tired and low blood pressure seem to be a result of calorie restriction. Anyway any advice? She refuses to seek counseling, she thinks she can loose weight on her own. I don‚Äôt think this is an issue of weight loss like she makes it out to be. I think she needs help. Lastly, she disclosed that even when she was playing soccer everyday after work, super active and 10 lbs skinnier, she STILL wasn‚Äôt happy with her body image. Again other sign I think it‚Äôs an issue. She‚Äôs late 20s. I‚Äôm early 20s. We‚Äôre both female",relationship_advice
t3_dkzfx4,Biological half sister passed away recently. Estranged biological father (who I've already disowned) begging to meet me.,"I've already posted about my situation in another subreddit. 

The gist of the story is this -

I'm a 21 year old female. My parents divorced when I was 10. Caught sperm donor banging his mistress (now wife) in my parents' bed. My mother ended up miscarrying and she was heavily pregnant. Sperm donor announced mistress was pregnant and that he loved her. Parents divorced. Mother went through a depressive episode. I almost lost her. I managed to survive through the court ordered visitations . Had no relationship with mistress turned wife and half sister. I finally moved to another country when I was 15. Mother married my wonderful stepfather and had my two little brothers. I stopped all contact with sperm donor once I moved to the new country. 

I'm 21 now and life was (is) finally good after years of pain &amp; hurt. 

Well last year, half sister got diagnosed with late stage leukemia. She passed away on the morning of my 21st birthday. 

I didn't feel affected in anyway, and although I felt sad that she passed away, It was like some distant relative that I never talk to passing away. I went ahead with my 21st birthday party and celebrated with friends and family. Had a great time. 

Because of half sister's passing, I decided not to put up the pictures on social media. Someone posted those pictures and mistress turned wife came across them. She said a lot of hurtful things about me and my mom on Facebook and also accused me of celebrating her daughter's death. She ended her rant by wishing death upon me. 


Well. I'm not proud of this , but I went nuclear. I exposed sperm donor and mistress turned wife and listed down all the hurtful things they did to me back when I was kid. I said that although half sister's passing was sad, I didn't consider her my sister and that I wasn't affected by her death , and therefore there was nothing wrong with me celebrating my birthday. 

I finally ended my post by disowning my father, and said that he was dead to me. 


I thought I made myself clear when I said that, but apparently sperm donor doesn't take no for an answer. He tried calling me back when the entire shit show went down, but I refused to talk to him. 

Now it has been 2 weeks since it all went down and things returned to normal in my life, when suddenly out of the blue, sperm donor SHOWED UP to my HOME lastnight , wanting to talk to me. I have no idea how he got our address. 

My mother wasn't home. I was there with my stepfather and brothers. Well, he started crying, asking my step dad to convince me to come downstairs to meet him. I refused. He continued with his bullshit for 3 hours. Crying, shouting, begging.

Finally my stepfather threatened to call the police and he left. My mother got home today morning and is telling me to meet him. He is here in this country for a week and according to my mother, he just wants to see me once before he returns. I don't want to see his face ever again in my life. I was finally happy. I don't want to deal with his toxic presence, but my mother is insisting I talk to him once. 

I'm at my wits end. Please give me some advice. What should I do?

t3_dlo3cv,[18 F] Talking to middle-school friend [18 M] ONLY once a year.. What does it mean?,"It‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm an 18 Female, he‚Äôs an 18M. It happens every year. So, we were kind of close friends in middle school (we were 13-14) and I had a little crush on him, but never claimed it or acted on it. I really admire him, he‚Äôs very successful, but I know that I‚Äôm not in his league. I‚Äôm not that pretty, nor social butterfly. I‚Äôm an introvert and he‚Äôs an absolute extrovert.

He has many girlfriends and sometimes he mentions them but I never took the conversation in that way. I never took his friendship in romantic way because I know who he is and I can‚Äôt get him or satisfy him in his social life.

But what I don‚Äôt understand is that, he texts to me (I don‚Äôt even have his phone number), every year, in summer, asks how I‚Äôm doing and about my life, we talk for 10 minutes about school and nerd life (lol) and say goodbye see you later and that‚Äôs it. Not a single word for a year. I don‚Äôt want to be a fool to believe that he has feelings for me, but guys, this has been happening to me for like 5 years, and I have no idea what the fuck should I understand from this. Am I his friend? I know I like him, but does he like me? He writes to many MANY girls, so.. what does that make me?

t3_dlo2s1,My [24] girlfriend [19] has dumped me... sorta... but won't tell me why?,"So we have been going out for about 6.5 months, and while we had our arguments, I thought everything was going fine. We're both going through some transition phase at the moment (new job/major life decisions) and she's been a bit stressed. I've tried to be as supporting as I can, but she's not a talker, she tends to bottle things up to herself.

Now she lives at Uni and when she's there, I don't get to see her. Last week she was at Uni and she was a bit distant with me, ignoring my texts and snapchats and giving me one-word answers without kisses, that kinda thing. I tried asking what was wrong but she just would ignore me.

At the weekend, she was due to go away for her work, but through my own stupidity I got a bit frustrated over text and ranted a bit about how I felt i'd done something and that she needs to talk so I can help resolve whatever issue. She basically was equally annoyed back at me, and through a lot of asking, she's used the following terms with me:-
""I do not feel like we are a couple anymore""
""I do not hate you, but I do not love you""
""I want space and time""

Now I am aware that I should just back off, but she also won't meet me, talk to me over the phone or explain where any of this has come from. I feel heartbroken, but I am really upset because I don't know why this happened; I just want to understand it so I can move on. She'll happily text me a little bit during the day, purely polite acquaintance stuff, but gets annoyed if I push for anything with a little more substance. As I type this, I realise I should just give her time and space, but... it's hard and I want to understand what i've done, if anything.

What should I do? What can I say to just get some closure?

t3_dlo0xl,My (17F) crush (17M) is a complete asshole. Why am I still obsessed with him?," Now, we're talking about a guy that's, lookswise, a 10 out of 10. Really sexy body, smooth, tall, the cuttest/sexiest face I've seen in person, like, my dream guy. To add to that, all girls that have been with him say that he is amazing in bed (we're still just 17, so it's pretty rare for guys to be really good at stuff like that).

 And now there is the other side of him. He is a complete and utter asshole. Period. Like, he's a jerk at school, well known fact, but when he came over to my place for a school project, that's when I really saw what an arrogant dick he was. Ehm: here's that story:

 So I was sitting on my bed plucking my violin (cuz that's what I do when I'm bored) and was both really excited and impatient about him coming over. Nobody else was home (personally made sure of it) so when he rang I quite literally ran to the door to open. There were a few seconds of us looking at each other with me thinking of how hot he is and how amazing this is going to be. And from then on things only went downhill.
 He walked in, didn't take his shoes off although I distinctly told him how the floors have just been cleaned (he was wearing his trashy Jordans that were pretty filthy) and continued to completely ignore me desperately trying to start a conversation. When he came in my room, he legit kicked my violin that was on the floor, got on my bed with his shoes on and started starring at his phone, probably swiping instagram. It took me half an hour to get him to actually work on the project with me, and even then he wouldn't stop asking me cocky questions like: ""Did you ever blow a guy?"", ""Do you get wet when you masturbate?"" and such completely irrelevant questions made only to annoy me. We finished with me having done 90% of the work and he left leaving me in a fucking mess of a room. Shoe prints over the bed, things randomly dropped from shelves, snacks (that he asked me for) all over the place... 

 You'd think that I'd never want to have anything to do with him again. Well, wrong, I am still excited around him, obsessed with getting a chance to speak him and still look at him as the ultimate prize, even tho he's such a jerk. Why?

 I like think of myself as an intelligent individual. Why would I still lose control around him if I have seen him treat me and my things like shit. Is something wrong with me? Educate me, please!",relationship_advice
t3_dlo0g3,My (21f) BF (26m) seems to think I‚Äôm just upset because of a lack of sex,"Here‚Äôs a little backstory: A little over two years ago now I got a random friend request from my current bf (T.) We talked online for an entire year and during that time I entered a poly relationship (lasted a year) and he got his cdl. After a year of being online friends (platonic for the most part but we both wanted more) he decided he wanted to ‚Äústeal‚Äù me. He wanted me but was not open to the poly relationship and I thought I owed it to my married bf to not run off with someone else (love can make you do/think some crazy things, I know.) 

Fast forward a few months of him trying to convince me not only to be with him but to come along with him over the road. I wasn‚Äôt very open to that idea because I enjoyed being able to provide for myself with my full time job and have freedom. On top of all that I had never even met the guy although I was pretty certain he wasn‚Äôt a catfish. One day on a whim I decided to go spend time with him while he was in town but he was only in town for a day. I drove an hour to his place one morning (I had work later that day) and everything started off nice. We had breakfast and went back to his place and watched some seriously funny tv. Things of course, got hot and heavy pretty quickly. Although this day started off great it ended up being one of the worst first dates I‚Äôve ever been on and it wasn‚Äôt entirely his fault. 

Fast forward another month and I hadn‚Äôt seen him. We barely talked but he still wanted me to be his gf and come with him. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, despite our first date and the fact he wanted me to quit my job for him I really liked this man so I agreed to see him again after work and for about a month after that went to his place after work whenever he was in town. I was moving out of my at this point ex‚Äôs and was looking for apartments when I decided to just say fuck it and checked to see if I had enough savings to afford quitting my job. I agreed to go along with him and have been living with him in his semi truck for a whole year now. 

We‚Äôve had some adventures but there are definitely a lot of boring days. I miss being productive, seeing friends and family, and having the financial freedom to do what I want. He got sick in January which resulted in him getting suspended off his truck and not getting paid for three months after that and having to squander his money for taxes on medical bills and trying to live. Also had to drive him home 10+ hours in a rental during this time. 

Lately I‚Äôve been really stressed because I‚Äôm 11 weeks pregnant, credit‚Äôs shit, and have no place except my parents‚Äô and his old smelly rv on top of the boredom. So I haven‚Äôt exactly been myself but I haven‚Äôt been moping around either. I try to entertain myself with reddit and other apps on my phone and it usually makes the long days go by faster but he‚Äôs been getting really annoyed with me for being bored. I don‚Äôt enjoy tv or video games the way a lot of people do. I like them on occasion but everyday for 14+ hours a day is a bit much. 

Last night he thought I was moping because he didn‚Äôt have sex with me. We have a pretty active sex life (about 5 times a week on average and in 26 states so far!) I was actually upset because he said something that implied that everything that we‚Äôve talked about doing (having babies, getting married) was just sexy talk so of course I was a little upset because I‚Äôve invested a lot into this relationship. So what he thought was me being a brat about not having sex was me stressing out about the fact that I‚Äôm actually pregnant and wondering if he‚Äôs ever going to be a good provider and father. 

I don‚Äôt remember exactly what was said but he said that I get upset when we don‚Äôt have sex every single night and that‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôm ever happy with him which isn‚Äôt remotely true. He then goes on to ask me if I‚Äôm just going home to cheat on him since I‚Äôm getting off the truck in a week due to the fact that I‚Äôll be in the second trimester and he‚Äôs going to a new company anyways. I told him no and I‚Äôve never given him a reason to believe I would even when he was texting other women things he shouldn‚Äôt while we were together. He told me he always thought i would cheat on him (ouch) and I reminded him again that I‚Äôve been 100% faithful and he knows this for a fact. 

There was a lot of other shit in the argument. He told me he didn‚Äôt like how deep I was (empath over here.) I told him how it upset me to hear him talk about our plans as fantasies and how I‚Äôve been super worried he‚Äôs going to put pot over our kid. I also told him he can take me on a date anytime if he wanted there to be ‚Äúmore‚Äù to our relationship. He told me I‚Äôve been miserable with him for months and I told him that wasn‚Äôt true. He lied to me a few months ago and I just wanted him to tell the truth but that‚Äôs a whole different story. He asked me why I‚Äôve even stayed with him and my only answer was love. He said that was no reason to stay and commented on my upbringing in a snarky way. He apparently has a problem with the fact that I was raised with loving parents who loved and supported me no matter what because he never never had that. I told him the biggest reason I stayed with him is because his life‚Äôs been a shit show this last year and I didn‚Äôt want to be another bad thing in his life. I wouldn‚Äôt want him to leave me at my lowest point. I added that I probably should have been more selfish and that was all she wrote. 

I‚Äôm conflicted. I need advice. This relationship has taken time away from my family and friends, drained me financially, and on some days,  bored me to death. And now the only reason I stayed isn‚Äôt even good enough apparently. I‚Äôm really stumped because I don‚Äôt want to leave him at all, I just want things to get better. 

Tl;dr bf of a year assumed I was moping about not getting laid last night when I was actually stressing out about our unborn child, living situation, and finances. Turned into a full blown argument about me only wanting sex from him, how I‚Äôm probably going to cheat on him when I get out of his semi, how I‚Äôve been miserable with him for awhile, and love isn‚Äôt a real reason to stay with someone. I really don‚Äôt want to leave him, please help.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnzqj,My best friend (18M) abused my sister (16F) and I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"My sister and I have always been pretty close, but ever since her and my best friend got together, she‚Äôs been extremely distant from the whole family.

I was instantly suspicious about it all and so was everyone else. After a while though, she seemed pretty happy so we just thought we had been overreacting all along.

We‚Äôre a pretty well off family, but we were always taught to earn our own money and not to rely on other people, but all of a sudden, my sister was asking my parents for money, and that was probably the last thing you‚Äôd find my sister doing a couple of months ago.

I asked my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù what was going on with my sister. I assumed he would know what was going on as they were always with each other and he just said he didn‚Äôt know. I just brushed it off until my sister became more anxious around family and more shifty and introverted. 

She hid away and started sneaking out in the middle of the night. This was very strange because she was usually a very well behaved and well mannered girl and no one would ever have anything bad to say about her.

After my mum and dad had found out about this, they forced her to admit why she‚Äôd been acting the way she had for the past couple of months, and after a while, she finally gave in.

She‚Äôd told us that my best friend had been threatening her if she didn‚Äôt get him money to buy drugs and he‚Äôd keep her locked in his house for extreme amounts of time, and that‚Äôs why she was always gone for so long. 

She said he verbally and physically abused her, and made her only eat certain things and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôd never eat at the table with us all. 

Everything was adding up. There was a lot she claimed about him and I believe all of it. 
He was always kind of an asshole, but I‚Äôd never thought he‚Äôd take it so far. I‚Äôm glad my sister is okay now, she‚Äôs safe but my parents are very careful about what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing online, where she‚Äôs going and who‚Äôs she‚Äôs speaking to. 

They are monitoring her phone and computer and they hardly actually let her outside without people they trust and/or an adult which I‚Äôd say is completely understandable.

Apart from all the stuff my sister is going through, it‚Äôs also had a massive impact on my life too. My sister and I are extremely close like I said at the beginning, and I don‚Äôt want her to feel embarrassed about what she‚Äôs been through or I don‚Äôt want her to feel weird about being around me because me and her ex were best friends for a long time. 

What should I tell her to make her feel safe? 

My ex best friend has been trying to contact me and making it seem like nothing happened. He wants to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù or ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Should I tell all his friends what happened so they‚Äôre aware? 

I‚Äôm asking so many questions to myself and I feel so lost as well. I‚Äôm so confused and every time I think of what he did to my own sister, i feel uneasy.

I‚Äôm really stuck on what to do and I‚Äôd just like some help. Thanks.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnyut,"My boyfriend(23) thinks marriage is dumb, and I(F/21) want it one day","It started last week. I had made a joke about marriage, to which he replied with ‚Äúweddings are dumb, but receptions are fun.‚Äù I was a bit disheartened to hear his response, but I retaliated with ‚Äúthen you can get eloped and still have a reception if that would make you happier.‚Äù He agreed with me, and the conversation ended.

Flash forward to last night, we were attending a concert. He complimented a girls sweater. Teasing him, I said ‚Äúif you like it so much, why don‚Äôt you marry it?‚Äù  He replied with ‚ÄúI told you, I probably don‚Äôt want to get married‚Äù. I paused before responding with ‚ÄúI thought it was just a ceremony you were talking about.‚Äù He explained that it was the general idea of marriage he didn‚Äôt like. We were in a loud, crowded area, so I dropped the subject and moved on.

This morning was the last interaction about the subject. He elaborated on what he meant, saying that he didn‚Äôt want to get married because it benefitted nothing but taxes. He expressed that he thought it was just a silly piece of paper.

I have no means to get married any time soon. I am only 21 and still in college. But it is something I‚Äôve always wanted in the future, along with children(another thing he had expressed, in the past, disinterest with). I always thought it was important to talk with your significant other about your long term goals so you know you have a similar want. If my boyfriend does not want to ever get married, then I know I will be hurt later on if this relationship continues.

Though, I feel like I would pressure him if I talk to him about this. We have only been together for three months. I don‚Äôt want to make it seem like I‚Äôm rushing this relationship. But I also hate the feeling of wasting time. I feel like if I don‚Äôt talk to him about it now, I‚Äôll end up getting hurt months or years later when he tells me he has no intention of marriage.

I am torn on what I should do, and how I should approach it. Should I let it go and see where the relationship takes me, since we‚Äôve only been together for a short amount of time? Or should I nip it at the bud, talk to him about it, and see what his true intentions are with this relationship and if he can see us being together for a while?",relationship_advice
t3_dkpxfk,My daughter is dying of complications from cancer. My wife and I don't agree on final interventions. How do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?,"I apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. Too much ugly crying.

We have been battling cancer for many months now. Her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. Eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. Either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. She could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. The other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

If she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt CPR. We have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

If she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

Both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. Even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. On top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

I don't want either of these interventions as I feel she has gone through enough. My wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. I don't want her to suffer any more.

I don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. We have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. A part of me feels like a POS for not wanting to try anything but I just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

What do I do to find common ground. I tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. Perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. My wife and I have agreed on a plan. We are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. Please support childhood cancer research. No parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: I appreciate all the advice and I want to give another update. Firstly, my daughter is only 5. I don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. Either way this all happened rather quickly. Last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. She was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. Her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called VOD which came on her very quickly. Within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

She does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. The medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. She has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

My wife and I decided to try intubation again but say no to CPR. She was intubated a couple hours ago. So far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. Both my wife and I are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

Thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. We'll take all the positive energy we can get.",relationship_advice

We live in the southern US. The good folks at r/AmItheAsshole told me to bring this concern here, so I am. I have more character space here so I'll go into more detail.

My boyfriend is wonderful. I am chronically ill and he has helped me through some shaky periods of illness, stays on the phone with my at night during panic attacks when it storms, and assures me everyday that he loves me and wants to be with me for, using his words, as long as I want him.

He has one problem, though. His brain to mouth filter is nonexistent and he has trouble with just saying or doing things without thinking through how other people feel until after the fact. He's never cruel, just oblivious. The rest is a copy-paste. 

My boyfriend is bisexual, I am gay. I don't have any problems with this and I trust him 100%. We've both been obvious about our sex life and him being with girls doesn't bother me as I know how bisexuality works.

My boyfriend has a problem with not really know what things are appropriate to tell a significant other. One night a few weeks ago he went out with friends (most of his friends are female), and one of these friends came onto him. He was talking about how he always felt sexually repressed in between the times we were able to see each other and she offered to ""help him out."" Ok, fine, whatever, he's handsome as hell. The problem is, my boyfriend apparently told this girl ""I'll think about it"" and told me he was tempted slightly by her offer. This broke my heart and I asked him why he would tell me those last few details. Like I said, he has a bad brain to mouth filter, and was legitimately sorry after the fact. He assured me he loved me and as much as he liked sex, he would never jeopardize our relationship just to have sex one time with someone he didn't even have feelings for. He said that ""tempted"" was a bad use of wording on his part. He thought about her offer for a second before realizing he didn't want do have sex with anybody who wasn't me.

A few days ago he was at a friends house. He came back from this and messaged me asking if I wanted to see a video of him ""assaulting"" his friend. He used to be in theatre and he has tons of videos of him fake fighting which he has showed me with a similar opening before, so I said sure.

The video was one of his female friend bending over and him smacking her ass, hard. I immediately felt my heart drop but didn't want to be insecure or act like I didn't trust him, so I just left it alone. He sent me another video a day later of him smacking the same girl on the butt twice more. These were not friendly butt taps btw, they were hard, full palm, with her bent over in one of them.

I don't mind him hanging out with friends but if he's that handsy/sexual with them, I don't want to hear about it. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it makes me feel shitty and uncomfortable. I don't want to sound possessive or jealous by telling him to not send me videos, photos, or messages from these friends if they end up like that. I'm just at a loss.

End copy-paste. The people at the other sub told me I was not the asshole (so far) but I don't know how to broach this with him easily. This is the only major problem in our relationship and I know he's been trying his best to be more tactful, and in a lot of ways, he has.",relationship_advice

t3_dlkf8f,How do I separate love and obsession?,"This might be a bit of a long post, so tl;dr at the bottom. Also I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry.

I've been dating my current boyfriend for 4 months now, and I am already self-aware that I have a horribly addictive personality. I've been addicted to a man before, alcohol, drugs, video games, you name it. I'm 18(F) and moving out now so I have a lot on my plate, but this boy has been amazingly loving, helpful, and the light of my life. Our relationship is going very well at the moment and I am so happy! 

The issue is, I can't seem to separate my love for him from my addictive obsession. Every decision I make during the day has to do with him, and it is not healthy. From the clothes I wear to the plans I make for my day, I am making a lot of decisions based on someone that I haven't even been with for very long. He doesn't even have anything to do with this, it's just a subconscious thing that I do and can't seem to change on my own. 

I don't always say yes to plans because I know that'll seem desperate, but sometimes I go out of my way to see him, making him a priority over other things that I should be prioritizing. 

My family is realizing that I'm prioritizing him over myself and it's just an awful feeling. I don't know how to separate this obsession from my relationship. I don't want to scare him off because I'm addicted to him, but I'm not really sure what to do. 

How do I make myself and my family a priority over this boy who I love and that loves me? I can't seem to do it. 

tl;dr: I have an addictive personality and make my boyfriend my number one priority at a time that I need to be prioritizing myself and my family.",relationship_advice

t3_dlkf1i,Marriage was probably DOA; still a soul crushing end,"I am 32 and my soon to be husband is 31. We are heading towards separating and I am in so much pain. I know we had our problems and it wasn't an easy marriage but by God I knew there was a lot of love and care involved.

In hindsight some of the issues we had were:

\- Communication breakdown:  I am very confrontational and when I see a problem I think  of it as something that needs to be fixed and addressed ASAP. My husband is totally conflict-avoidant. He is also super stubborn. So we were never able to resolve conflicts peacefully and without escalation.

\- He didn't know how to say sorry. He HATED apologizing and thought it made him weak. As a result I started resenting him

\- I was a deeply horrendously ungrateful wife. I grew jealous of my friend's wealthy husbands and constantly put my husband down. I made him feel nothing he did was good enough. This broke his heart and he told me  multiple times but I would.not.listen because I thought I knew best.

\- Our families didn't blend well. His family was mean to me and did not like me. I took out the stress of it on him. He was put in the impossible situation between his family and me.

\- He wanted a lot more alone time vs I wanted more together time. I definitely was co-dependent and wished I had developed an outside life outside of our marriage.

\- I relied on him for everything and was not a good partner.  I wish I helped out more with chores and finances.

\- I put down his political beliefs and made fun of him. SO HORRIBLE I know.

t3_dlhfky,I (30M) has fallen in love with my (29F) best friend but don't want to lose her.,"So I have been friends with this girl (Lets call her SG) for about 8 years now.  
I didn't have feelings for her then.

But fast forward 5 years and that's when I started falling for her. Back then I didn't know it was love as I was seeing other people (so was she) and I guess they were distracting me from my feelings and I guess, confused. I didn't know I loved her and I ignored my feelings for such a long time.

It's been almost a year now that I starting being aware of my feelings for her and it's hard to just ignore this feeling anymore.

I dated a couple of girls this past year but was unable to love them back because of my feelings for SG and that caused these relationships to not work out.

We have kissed few times because we where drunk and had cam ""sex"" once last year because she wanted to. We also have jokingly said once that we could mold a replica of my dong as a dildo for her lol

She is currently in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend but she told me she that its been a while she lost feelings for him and she doesn't love him anymore. They used to Skype every day but now it's once a week at best. 

She also recently lost her father to cancer and I have been supporting her and being there for her and I don't want to hurt her.

I don't know what to do. If I should tell her or not and when? Should I wait? But I really don't want to lose her friendship as she is very dear to me and really care about her. Should I just keep these feelings for my self and try to ignore them. Maybe try to stop being in love with her?

t3_dlkeck,How does one tell (as a guy) if a girl is into you or just wants to be a close friend?,"Please let me know if this is the wrong place for this question and I'll look for a new home for it.

I'll preface this with establishing that I am perfectly happy with either result. I'm not pissy about being friendzoned or anything because my original intent was to be friends, I'm just confused about signaling. This person is fairly possessive about friends (in an endearing way) but I feel like she gives me slightly more attention / slightly different attention than other guys that she's friends with. Things like more telling me to sit near her, poking (which I don't mind because I'm starved for social interaction), gossiping (though this one is probably most at-level with anyone else she's friends with), etc.

Again, I'm perfectly alright with being no more than a friend. That said, I'm a bit of a social moron, and actually really haven't socialized a whole lot before this school year (this seems to be mostly related to mental health). I know of at least 3 instances over the past 3 years of college where I was entirely oblivious to signals of interest and I really don't want to keep wasting opportunities to have a deeper relationship with someone in that way. Also it makes me feel really stupid. However, in the interest of actually being a good friend, I don't want to make things awkward between us if I'm misinterpreting. 

So I guess my question is, how do you distinguish between signals of romantic interest VS good friendship as a socially inept guy? How do you avoid misinterpretation, especially such as it pertains to prior fear of missing out etc? Thanks for any advice in advance in case I don't get around to replying.",relationship_advice

Me and C (refering to F17 as C) have been friends for over 2 years now. We met through a mutual. Shes Australian and im Dutch we never met IRL (I do know what she looks like she knows what i look like). Im gonna cut things really short cause I dont quite know whats relevant to this and whats not. Anyways whenever C is mad or dealing with own problems she seems to ignore me. Once she ignored me for like a month and till this day I dont even quite know why. I have no idea how one can just decide to ignore another without feeling terrible but she seems to have no problems doing it. At this point im starting to think why I'm still being nice to her, do nice things for her cause when she'd get mad she seems to soley focus on the thing shes mad about to fuel that anger I guess. 

Whenever things are normal shes alright. Not exceptionally nice or whatever just ok so once again im starting to question why im trying to hard to be nice to her all the time. (I get that she doesnt owe me anything cause im being nice to her) Shes been my friend for over 2 years like I said and on one side I feel like i wanna stop the friendship but on one side I wanna hold onto it cause we've been friends for so long. Also I have no idea how to end a friendship, I thought about just ignoring and let it fade out but ignoring seems so cruel and I dont get how people do it. Sorry for this probably super bad post.

So here‚Äôs the story. 

My male friend, we‚Äôll call him John is attracted to my female friend that we‚Äôll call Jane. They have prior history with each other, they met when they were seventeen and I‚Äôve been told that they did have feelings for each other at that time. 

However nothing ever happened between them. I have been told by both John and Jane that nothing happened because John was uncomfortable ever doing anything. 

So six months ago I was introduced to Jane and their was an instant connection between the two of us. We would talk for hours and go out and just have fun together, recently she told me that she found me attractive and obviously I feel the same. We‚Äôve both decided to enter a friends with benefits situation with each other. Why friends with benefits? Well she recently ended a long term relationship and didn‚Äôt want anything serious and I don‚Äôt really want a relationship right now. So this seemed to be the best option for the both of us. 

We‚Äôre both mature adults who can make our own decisions but John has recently made some remarks that I would need his permission to pursue anything with Jane, even going as far as saying that if I didn‚Äôt ask him for permission and did pursue something I wasn‚Äôt a real friend. 

I honestly think he‚Äôs being childish. He‚Äôs angered both Jane and I with his comments. 

Despite this I would like to hear others opinions on this situation.

t3_dlnol3,Am I (28f) overreacting over potential SO's (28m) attitude?,"This could potentially be pretty lengthy so sorry in advance, TL;DR will be at the bottom.  


I met Lewis a few months back through mutual friends, we hit it off immediately and despite him just breaking up with his girlfriend, something between us kind of happened and it was great, we got along really well and the conversation flowed and was great. He was supportive, friendly and acted like he gave a shit basically.  
Then out of the blue, he's completely different, like almost speaking to a different person kind of change. I feel like the only way to describe it is that he views me as a side character and he's the protagonist - it's suddenly all about him and I'm solely here to listen to whatever he wants to talk about, like I'll ask how his day has been and that's all we'll talk about for hours on end, with no reciprocation. It's not like I need or even want to talk about myself but I just feel like he has very, very little interest in me as a person and not me as like, whatever it is he's suddenly viewing me as. He's started kind of talking to me a little like shit, which when I called him out for it, he apologized and said he was having a rough week and literally 20 minutes later, gushed about how awesome his week has been?   
Not only that, some of the things he's said over these past few months have really confused me. He told me he was feeling sick one day and after a bit of probing he told me he was going on a date with a girl who he had slept with the week before, he regrets it because he isn't into casual sex and it just happened despite the pair of them being completely sober and he doesn't feel ready for a relationship and he doesn't like her in that regard but he really wants to see the film? The next day, when he was going on the date, he was telling me he might want to date her after all and that's why he felt sick - I was just friends with him back then and encouraged him to go for it if he feels like there's potential for it to happen, anyways, nothing came of it and he ended up telling me that he had a thing for me a few days later. Anyways, we were talking the other week and he's denying having sex with her, ever and even going on a date with her, I know I'm not crazy and I know it happened, I also made a point of being like ""I don't care, it doesn't matter what happened before me and you."" but it's like he was accusing me of making it up. 

Next to that, he's told me things that just don't add up, like how much weed he smokes, whether he's genuinely religious or attends the church for social reasons, his educational career, his job. I'm just very, very, very confused and I'm not sure whether I should bother with this person in a romantic way further or whether I should sit him down and talk to him about this and give him a second chance? Like I said, he was great and something has suddenly changed out of the blue.

t3_dlhczg,I( Virgin M20) Don't know how female friend (F22) feels about me after movie incident,"Throwaway because I'm a super nervous person and don't want any of my friends finding this post.

Okay, to start this off I've known this girl who we will call Sarah for like a few months. We had worked at the same place but had extended our friendship to outside of work. She was going through a long divorce and has a little girl. I had had a crush on her and when I subtly tried to shoot my shot she told me she only saw me as a friend. I was initially down about it but came to just respect it and move on. We started texting almost daily now at this point and I don't think nothing of it now cause shes explained she just wants to be friends. We go out to eat, go to the movies and chill out on her porch with her other friends n family. It starts getting more personal. She calls me when she's sad and wants me to come over to comfort her. Okay, just normal friend shit right? I guess so. Well, now its time for.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Tha Movie incident\*\*

Okay, so its mid-day and Sarah and I don't have shit to do. She doesn't have her little girl and I don't have work so we decide to rent a movie and watch it at her place. She doesn't have a central living room so if we were to watch a movie it would usually be in her moms' room as like the gathering place for that kind of shit but Sarah has a tv in her room as well. Her mom says she doesn't want to watch the movie with us so we have to watch it in her room completely fine nothing out of the ordinary and this is when I ran into my first problem. \*\*It's cold as all here in her room\*\* for reference I had been in her room quite a few times and it was never as cold as it was in there that day. It was still moderately hot outside at the time and I was wearing shorts and a thin shirt so I was freezing my ass off in her room. When I asked her if I could turn off the Fan or AC she told me that they never go off. You guys I was on her bed freezing my absolute dick off and I saw her get some cover and throw it over herself. I was cold as hell and pulled some of it over me too not thinking much of it; so now we are both under the cover watching the movie. I don't think much of it and try to make little conversation while were watching the movie. Fast forward like 30 mins into the movie and my arm is numb from having it in only one place for so long, I go to lift my hand up and move it and I guess it looked like I was trying to put my hand around her or something so she comes in and cuddles up on me. I'm excited and confused af now because I didn't know what to make out of this. It was pretty cold so maybe she just wanted to get warmer? Did she really like me but was too shy to say something? I'm just racking my brain on n on about this until I decide to test the vibe. I slowly slide my hand down to her butt just to see if she would stop me or say something and well she didn't say anything. We sit like this for a while until I finally get the guts to ask ""Hey Sarah have you always liked me?"" her response ""Well yea I don't mind you being around you're chill"" I probably should've asked her a more clarified question but I didn't and that confused me even more because I didn't know what to think of it. So on with the story, the movie ended and she stops cuddling with me but still lays directly to the side of me. I decided to test her further and rub her tits. I'm super nervous that I might be doing something wrong and ask her ""Are you ok with this?"" her response ""If I wasn't ok with this I wouldn't have let you touch my ass"" ok ok fair ig. I start rubbing under her shirt but her face is completely expressionless like not scared, not excited, not shy, not happy just nothing just a blank face. She was just looking dead at me and I decided I should go in for a kiss. I did. After that, she still had a blank look on her face and asked me ""what made you like me?"" I explained it all to her then it was just complete silence. I didn't touch her again and she didn't say anything. The night ended with me going home, nothing else happened

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few days, nothing has really been different we still text each other daily and I still do regular friend shit with her. But I'm so confused. Does she like me? Was that just a fluke? Why was she so non-respondent? Did I do something wrong? I've been racking my brain about this for the past week and I need outsider's opinions on this.",relationship_advice

Im sick and tired of financially supporting my partner. We‚Äôve been together a couple of years, I moved in with him six months ago. He‚Äôd had a few jobs before I moved in but always managed to pay his rent. Had an ok job but he hated it...so much so he made it known to his bosses how much he hated it and subsequently got fired. So he got fired within 3 months of me moving in.

Hes been getting his rent paid by benefits but that‚Äôs it (plus he won‚Äôt declare I‚Äôm living with him either so I feel vulnerable). I‚Äôm paying for everything else (tobacco, food, clothes, bills, meals out etc). He‚Äôs been attending a government funded course which he promised would make him highly employable. He said he‚Äôd be able to cherry pick a well paid job. The course has finished but there‚Äôs no jobs apparently. He doesn‚Äôt drive (Ive been paying for lessons for him as a Bday present) and says there‚Äôs no jobs out there. He says he‚Äôll get a minimum wage job if he has to but he will be unhappy...he says he‚Äôs never had the opportunity to study before and wants to do another course as he wants to be able to ‚Äòbuy me nice things‚Äô.

Hes a decent guy. He doesn‚Äôt ask me for money. I can‚Äôt see him starve so I step up and help him out. Any money he does have he‚Äôll spend it on me. I dont work due to ill health, though I plan to return within the next few months- luckily I have savings that are keeping me/him afloat. Saying that he is very caring and waits on me constantly. 

Im just feeling resentful. Some days I look at him and absolutely hate him; he‚Äôll talk about the nice things he wants in life...but he‚Äôs not doing anything to achieve them. I‚Äôve packed my bag but the thought of trying to take care of myself whilst awaiting surgery is exhausting. I don‚Äôt have family to help.

Im immediately like ABSOLUTELY dumb founded. Ew? Granted, he‚Äôs adopted so that‚Äôs their ‚Äúit‚Äôs cool‚Äù thing. But I adamantly said that would never happen. 

My cousin texts me once we‚Äôre all home about the night I was drunk and asks me if I remember what happened. I played dumb to see what he‚Äôd say and he told me I was the one all over him and granted I don‚Äôt remember much but I know for a fact some of the things he mentioned didn‚Äôt happen. So I immediately feel like total crap and creeped out. He ended up telling me not to drink anymore or someone would take advantage of me. It was just all really creepy. So I haven‚Äôt talked to him much since.

Something recently happened where he lied about where he was staying when he road tripped down here and I ranted to my mom about how I don‚Äôt want to see him anymore, her not knowing why, thought I was being a brat. So I told her about my drunk night. 
She basically told me if I hadn‚Äôt given off the wrong idea been leaning on him. Maybe this all wouldn‚Äôt have happened. I need to stop ‚Äúacting so innocent‚Äù and admit that I was flirting. 

So sorry but maybe I‚Äôm wrong but I thought family could be family without getting the ‚Äúyou must like him‚Äù red card flung out.
Again, we goofed off and I occasionally would nap on his shoulder. But that was the extent.",relationship_advice
t3_dlkado,I (24F) did exactly what I told my boyfriend (27M) I would do and he‚Äôs pissed at me,"There is a lot of context and this is going to be long, so please bear with me. My boyfriend and I decided he would move into my townhouse, which was very exciting for me, as I‚Äôve never been in a relationship where this happened. We love each other and were ready for the next step. I can admit that my house wasn‚Äôt exactly the cleanest. By that I  mean that organizing wasn‚Äôt my strong suit and I hoarded a lot of things, plus I had two roommates who never cleaned when I wasn‚Äôt there, which is a whole other story. Like I‚Äôd have to tell them what to do, even though they were both adults. I was staying at my boyfriends for about two months for the most part, although I‚Äôd go home occasionally and, of course, the house is a disaster each time. The idea of moving into that stressed him out, which I can‚Äôt blame him for. One of the roommates moved out on his own, which was bittersweet since he‚Äôs a really good friend of mine, but also relieving since he never did anything to help around the house without me prompting him to. The other roommate was given until December to move out so she can prepare and organize her things. 

My boyfriend (27M, call him S) suggested one day that I go over to my house and start doing a lot of cleaning/organizing/getting rid of things since I wasn‚Äôt working (we‚Äôre both in the military, but I am on terminal leave - meaning I saved up a bunch of days off before my contract ends so I could still get paid during that time and not go to work). Naturally, I agreed. I did a lot in 2 days. He came after work one day and agreed everything was looking much better. So we started slowly moving in his things. We originally wanted to move in everything by the end of Columbus weekend, however he changed his mind to this past weekend. That was fine, but I told him I already had plans for the weekend that only took up about 2 hours each day. He said that was fine. Saturday was my best friends birthday party in the early afternoon, and then we went to move everything with the help of my parents. I was there for all of it. My parents said they would come help us clean the apartment the next day since giving his apartment complex $200 for a relatively easy clean didn‚Äôt make sense. S just wanted to wash his hands of it and be done, but my parents convinced him it wasn‚Äôt worth it and that the cleaning would take 2 hours tops. I told them and reminded my boyfriend of the plans I had that day, to which everyone said that was fine. We went to his apartment on Sunday and cleaned everything, then went back to the house and my stepdad helped fix a few things I had noticed were messed up. My plans to play Pok√©mon go were originally for 12 but I didn‚Äôt go out to meet everyone till 2:30 since my parents were still at my house. I had to go at 2:30 because, for anyone who doesn‚Äôt play, an EX raid was at that time and those only last for 45 minutes. Then my friends and I did some regular T5 raids for about an hour and a half after that, then I went home. When I left, S said he wasn‚Äôt going to tell me what to do, however I have responsibilities at the house. Of course I know that, I wasn‚Äôt avoiding them. I was doing what I told him and reminded him multiple times what I was doing. If he had a real issue with it at any of those times, he should have told me. But he didn‚Äôt.

Okay, context over. Yesterday, I was home doing some research for a few hours and then I started organizing a few things that I knew where they were going, cleaned the dishes, and wiped down the kitchen counters. He comes homes from work and asks me what I did, so I told him. I then joked that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on terminal, I don‚Äôt want to do anything.‚Äù  Which I mean is slightly true, sometimes it‚Äôs nice to do nothing, but I know I have responsibilities here. He laughed at that and we were joking around for a half hour. My friend M asked me to go have dinner with her last week and I said the weekend was far too chaotic, but Monday would work. She felt as if our friendship was dying and neither of us wanted that. S knew and was even invited, to which he declined. He started cooking his own dinner as I grabbed the last few boxes in his car and brought them into the house. He had been looking for one item that was in one of the boxes and I told him I found it. He put it where he wanted it, and then I asked him if he wanted the rest of the stuff in the box on the bottom bookshelf. He said he didn‚Äôt know, so I put the two boxes upstairs in the spare bedroom with the rest of his extra stuff (the room is getting crowded). For some reason, this made him irritated. He finished cooking his dinner and then started washing dishes, to my shock. Everything that has been on the counter had been washed and was drying; I was very surprised at where that all came from. He made a comment under his breathe, ‚ÄúI have to do everything around here, as always.‚Äù I asked him, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Genuinely confused as I thought I had done everything. He didn‚Äôt say anything, so I sat back down on the couch and kept reading. I‚Äôll be honest, at this point I don‚Äôt remember everything since I‚Äôve probably blocked out some of it, but I‚Äôll be as concise as I can. S pretty much blew up and said that he does everything around the house and I‚Äôm of no help, which I couldn‚Äôt disagree with more. When it came to packing his things, I asked him what he wanted me to do because I know my boyfriend - he wants things done a certain way. I‚Äôd ask him if I should do this, this, or that, and he‚Äôd tell me which to do, so I did it. I know how to pack things, I‚Äôve moved a lot in my life, but because he‚Äôs so particular about things, I wanted to make sure I was doing what he wanted correctly. For unpacking/organizing his things, it‚Äôs the same thing. I‚Äôm not going to do it without his direction. When I say he‚Äôs very particular about things, I‚Äôm not joking. He moved things around in our bedroom, got rid of things that I had bought to be replaced with his, etc. that‚Äôs all fine to me, I wasn‚Äôt attached to anything, I‚Äôm just trying to give some context. I clean when he‚Äôs at work because I am at home not doing much of anything, so me taking an hour or two to clean is fine. S said he feels like he‚Äôs being pulled in numerous different directions and he can‚Äôt do everything, he can‚Äôt tell me everything I need to do, he‚Äôs tired of being tired, he‚Äôs tired of feeling like I‚Äôm not listening to him, he‚Äôs tired of being stressed out, etc. I know all of this and I‚Äôve tried to make the transition as smooth as possible for him. To me, he made it seem like I need to wait on him hand and foot, which irritated him. ‚ÄúDo you really think that‚Äôs what I want?‚Äù No, but I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding what you‚Äôre pissed about since the plans I had I reiterated numerous times about and he never said he didn‚Äôt want me doing it. Unless you consider him reminding me I had responsibilities his way of saying that, which very well could be. I‚Äôm honestly at a lost. I asked him to explain to me why he‚Äôs pissed, but he won‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs done is done,‚Äù is what he said. That doesn‚Äôt help AT ALL. I genuinely want to understand what I did wrong so I don‚Äôt do it again, but he won‚Äôt explain it to me. I‚Äôm at a loss. I can‚Äôt articulate his side of the story 100%  because I don‚Äôt know what the fuck his side is, so please don‚Äôt accuse me of twisting the narrative to make me seem innocent. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what the hell is going on. Am I the asshole in this situation?",relationship_advice
t3_dlk9a9,Going to nba game with my girlfriend,"I‚Äôm taking my girlfriend for her first nba game in few days.
She never been to one, and she‚Äôs not a big sports fan, but i think that it‚Äôs an experience that she should try and she agrees

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs better to get the front section tickets (not courtside, but really close) for about 150$ per ticket, or the middle section for about 70$ per ticket 

Obviously the money makes a difference, but i want to make sure that she‚Äôll have the best experience possible for someone who isn‚Äôt a fan of nba. So if it‚Äôs worth it I don‚Äôt mind to spend extra here, and save on our next couple of dates (we usually don‚Äôt spend much when going out)

The question is if you think she‚Äôll necessarily have more fun close to the court than in the middle section, or will it be about the same for her, and therefore doesn‚Äôt worth the extra money

t3_dlnkql,Idk if im just beeing too dramatic..,"So me and my bf are going out for a year. And there are times that i feel that he's not interested in me  sexually anymore. In the start of our relationship he was very loving and excited to have sex with me n just do things like that. 
But later on i started to feel like he just drifted away with everything. 

Earlier when i sent him nudes n stuff he would reply with hearts n shit, but now he doesn't even say anything...

We were home one night. I was in one room he was in the other playing games. I went to him and he was just so startled after seeing me. I came to him and asked what was he doing, he ofc said nothing. But it still looked weird af cuz, when i came in he just like put away his phone, like real fast under the pillow. And after some time i just took the phone and saw that he was watching porn... 
I wouldn't be sad about it but the thing is that just before that i suggested him to have sex with me, but he refused.

Also he follows a lot of girls that post pics of them half naked, like pics when u can almost see every inch of their body. And if makes me feel very uncomfortable, cuz i have big self image problems, and was just starting to finally like the way i look. 
I confronted him about it and the thing that hurted me the most is that he was like ""what wrong about that, yeah maybe i sometimes thing of how i would fuck them"". 

Also i overheard that he said to my friend that it would be nice if i would weight less, but when i asked him about it he said that he likes how i look, but i still should go to a gym. 
The thing is that i have been strying to loose weight, and my friends are even DM'ing me that i should eat, cuz they are concerned about my health. But as i see it i still dont look good enough for him... 


There are more to this but its hard for me and its getting harder, i just dont even know what to do. i love him a lot, but his remarks just make it hard for me to feel good in my own skin. Idk what should i do? How to talk to him again without him saying that i say nonsense...",relationship_advice
t3_dlig3x,I feel like I found my man too soon,"           I‚Äôm not sure how to put this mainly because it‚Äôs a thought I‚Äôve tried to ignore. I‚Äôve (24f) been dating my boyfriend (23m) for going on four years now. We had a very quick start to our relationship which lead to me moving in with him and his family about 3 months after dating. Yet we were friends for over a year before even dating. But as the years have passed I feel like I‚Äôve been changing and I know he has. Every passing day he grows more into the amazing man I‚Äôve seen from the beginning. I admire him so much for all he has done for himself. The dedication and strength he has to bettering himself, especially in a town known for its drug use and deadbeats. He is amazingly sweet and I love him so much. But I feel like I‚Äôve met him too soon.

          As he has changed so have I. I‚Äôve worked on bettering myself as well. From promotions at work to a healthier lifestyle I‚Äôve been pushing harder then ever. I‚Äôm really happy with the progress I have made but I feel like there is a next step. I need more time for myself to reach this though. So I don‚Äôt know what to do.

         I feel like I‚Äôm at a crossroads with our relationship. I know he is the one I want to start a family with. I want to grow old and laugh with him. Yet I need more time for myself. But if I do tell him this and suggest taking a break I may never have this life again. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to be with him but I want more time to focus on myself and get myself to a better point mentally, physically and emotionally.

t3_dlk3ky,My(20f) boyfriend(21m) has been texting his ex and telling lies about me and his relationship status among other things,"For some background I have been seriously dating this guy for a month but it started out (just friends having sex) fairly soon after he broke up with his girlfriend. A month ago he admitted having feelings for me and I felt the same so we started dating pretty seriously. Everything about the relationship has seemed perfect up until this point. That is, until I, and I admit this shamefully, snooped into my boyfriend's text messages last night after I caught a glimpse of an unusually long outgoing message that he had sent. I tried to brush it off as nothing to worry about but he is not a big texter so it was especially out of the ordinary. 

I finally but the bullet last night and looked at his messages and I discovered that he has been texting his ex girlfriend, specifically lying to her about the way his last relationship(the one after her and before me) ended. He said told her that he had gotten dumped but told our whole friend group that he had been the one to end the relationship. 

He also misrepresented the dynamic of the first time we had sex, saying that I took advantage of him after he had been broken up with and was in an emotionally vulnerable state but this was not the case. He initiated the sex and also he was not the one who got broken up with. 

Another thing that bothers me is the fact that he mentions his loneliness a lot and not having anyone to talk to. Maybe this is my fault for not being supportive enough but I definitely try my best to be a satisfactory confidante for him. He has also not mentioned me to her except for the slanderous bit and he acts like he is single and ignores our relationship entirely. 

These things combined with the occasional flirty tone or comment have led me to believe that this whole thing could be significant.
I don't know if all of these behaviors mean that he still has feelings for his ex, he is just friends with her, or some other possibility.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnbuu,Getting out of an abusive relationship (long),"This is the third time I'm trying to get to the end of my story and get to the point. I wasn't able to finish it the whole day and even remembering everything screws up my mood. (Throwaway account, on phone, not native English speaker).

I (28f) got married 2,5 years ago. We were together 5 years before that with my husband (35m) and lived together 4,5years of our relationship before marriage. I thought I know him. To be honest, I did, all the signs where there. I was just blind.

First, and now a quite huge issue is our sex life. After a year of dating (half year living together) he started saying no to sex and got waaay to conservative. He didn't want to try anything new and got upset with me when I initiated. This lasted for a year and our sex life dropped to 1-2 times a month at best. After some time he changed his mind and said he missed our sex so he started initiating and even asking what I like, what would I like him to do differently. I was open and honest with him. I told him that I like when things got a bit more rough (gently pulling my hair, maybe holding me down, touching me with a bit of force). He immediately started touching me so gently it tickled. First of all I hate being tickled and he knew. It also totally kills my mood. I also told him, that I like how he lifted me up and repositioned if we were in an uncomfortable position. I wasn't a piece of wood in bed so it wasn't necessary, but I saw it as very thoughtful and sexy. He never did it again since than. I tried to talk to him about this and he told me, that what I said killed his confidence. So basically he wasn't interested in things that will make me happy, he just wanted me to tell him everything is perfect, and wasn't expecting me to tell the truth.

Slowly the fights started. At first I was trying really hard to build up some communication and talk through our issues, but he always somehow gaslighted me, turning the conversation in another direction. 

Then came the accusations. That I am the reason why he doesn't hang out with his friends anymore. Whenever they called him I was supportive, smiling and telling him to go and have fun. He was always tired, had a hard day, not in the mood... But somehow it was my fault he always said no to them, because he ""would feel bad leaving me alone at home"". I was fine with it. Would've grabbed a book maybe open a vine or make myself hot chocolate, so now I see how stupid I was believing him.

The arguments became more frequent and more violent. He would often push me to the ground or hold me down while screaming to my face. I became depressed, but somehow got myself together and landed a nicely paid job. Thing got better for some time and I believed that he really changed. 

Fast forward to the year of the wedding. He proposed, I said yes (stupid, I know). Before the wedding I went to my OB/GYN to get some tests done, because we talked about having a baby after the wedding. The test results came back and it was clear that I have a cyst on my cervix which is infected with HPV. A virus causing cancer. I got surgery after the wedding and just in time so I am ok. But I lost my job. I was at home in pain for 1 month and my boss told me to the phone, that she is expecting me to go on maternity leave soon (wtf?) and that she does not need this now in her team. Also important to mention, that before that I got a dog. A sweet girl who I love with my whole heart. After I lost my job my depression kicked in again. We were quite safe financially, because we had some savings, so we decided I will stay home for some time. 

The fights started again and escalated to one really bad incident. It ended with me getting pushed to the floor, he was choking me and beating my head against the doorframe while he screamed to my face he will kill me. I somehow got away, but he started throwing stuff after me. Like full force, heavy stuff. While I was trying to escape he threw a full glass of water after me (the glass to) and hit the TV and broke it. It was a quite new flat screen 1,5 year old. Something else flew right next to my head, hit the wall and left a hole. The next thing (I wasn't looking what he was throwing anymore) hit the tiles in the kitchen and broke it. I managed to get to the bathroom and closed myself there(my dog was already locked in there for protection). He banged on the door for some time, demanded that I let him in. In the meantime I called the cops. And when he realized I won't let him in he started trashing the kitchen. He broke a lot of dishes and stuff. Then went, trashed the living room and bedroom as well breaking the coffee table and the bed frame.

When the police came I ran for the door and let them in. He instantly started crying, saying he was sorry, that he lost his temper. They asked if I wanted to press charges. I did not (stupid again, but I didn't want to ruin his life having a record of domestic violence and assault).

This was two years ago. Most of those two years I spent in bed unable to get out. Whenever I wanted to got to shop or anywhere I got a bad panic attack. I was briefly working from home but most of the expenses were covered by him. He shopped, cleaned and cooked and made me eat. Basically took care of me while I couldn't. I was really grateful for that, but thinking about it now, he did most of this to me. 

Two months ago I somehow got my sh*t together and got a job. It's low paying a below my education, but I don't care. I feel good there. 

Here is where my problem starts. I'm going to divorce this man, that's for sure and I even told him this some time ago, but he won't take me seriously. I told him a few times that we are over. But. I don't have anywhere to go (no parents or anything), I can't afford a rent and I can't go to a rent with a dog anyway so it's not an option. There is also a loan on the apartment. What I wish to do is: get some savings, figure out how can I pay the loan and the household expenses alone and keep the apartment. Of course the dog stays with me. No question there, so I need to think about her expenses as well. His salary is twice as much as mine, so he can comfortably get a rent or even go back to his mother.

He is still forcing me to act like we are a couple, but we don't have sex and since I got better I became cold and distant to him.

And here comes the part I need your advice. I really miss intimacy by now, to the point it's driving me crazy. Any mention of sex , which does not involve my husband makes me horny. There is a guy in my workplace I really like. As far as I know he doesn't know I'm married yet. There was some flirting and maybe I would be interested in something more. The moral part of ""is it cheating or not"" is on me. I will decide when the time comes. My problem is that my husband works there as well, in a totally different department, so we do not meet to often. But the guy will eventually know. Is my situation something that I can explain to this guy? If yes, how can I explain this? Would you start anything with a woman in my situation? Or I need to wait another 1,5/1 year to get out of this mess to be intimate again with someone?

Edit: Just to be clear, under no circumstances will I lie to this guy. If anything happens he will be completely aware of the situation beforehand.",relationship_advice

t3_dln71o,Relationship purgatory,"My (29M) ex partner (27F) have been officially separated since April. We bought our first house in March. She is diagnosed as bipolar and is not employed. She struggles mentally regularly but is getting therapy weekly and takes medication as directed. She doesn't have the means to support herself.

I still love her and want to be together, the separation was her choice and our relationship remains good and lies somewhere between very close friends and intimate partners. There is potential for us to resume our relationship, but she's not currently willing to commit to me.

I am impatient and want to know if we have a future together as friends or partners. I only want to live with my partner, not my friend and I'm not interested in looking for new relationships until I know I can't be with her.

I can't kick her out because the house is as much hers as mine and we both love it.

In addition, she met a guy on Tinder who admittedly is a nice guy that comes over to our house. He comes over more than I'd prefer (several times per week) and she gets upset when I voice my displeasure and encourages me to be friends with him. She describes her relationship with him as more than friends but not dating or sexual, not so different than my relationship with her.

I feel stuck and like I have no choice but to continue to support her despite my discomfort and impatience. She refuses to agree to a timeline until she feels mentally stable which of course can't functionally be given a timeline.

I recently went to another country on a university trip with my class. On one evening there was a big party for people in the industry we all want to go into that my class was very lucky to be invited to. As it was a party there was a bit of drinking involved, I didn't get drunk but I was tipsy.

During the walk back, I wanted to go the long way passed the lake, which is honestly beautiful (This place is in the alps) and I was pointing out all the constellations I could see.

t3_dljt4h,"I (F18) fell in love with M18 but he somehow ""dumped"" me","So I've met him (18) online through an app (not Tinder or anything like this tho) and we got along pretty well. We both liked the same music, memes and (the worst part about it) nudes.
After about a month of talking and chatting about regular stuff we suddenly decided to have a fwb-like relationship. Basically, we sent nudes to each other.
It wasn't a bad thing tho, he always cared about me, was lovable and super cute (in my eyes) and he made sure that he won't share my nudes.
At this point I fell in love with him because it was so cute how he cared about me even though I liked him before too.
About 4 months ago (3 months after we got to know each other) I decided to ask if he'd think if there's a chance if we could date each other because I told him that I love him. But he just responded that he already had 4 gf's and figured out a relationship isn't something for him. I just accepted his answer but we continued for 4 months like before as if nothing really happened.
But a week ago he suddenly told me that he has a ""new"" crush and he wants us to stop our ""fwb""-relationship because he's super close to be together with her (but he also wants me to be his friend because ""he likes me so much"") . And this actually confused me because it didn't fit in any way to what he said some months before. Another point is, when I fall in love, I can't easily let go and that's why I keep attaching to his friendship thingy but at the same time it also hurts me a lot to see him with a different girl. 
And now I'm making myself stressed because I think he somehow ""dumped"" me because I am too ugly, fat or anything else and I've been crying about this nearly every night since last week because of this.

t3_dljriu,I met a nice girl but now my social anxiety hit me. (long),"Hi,

So before telling you about how we met, I would like to briefly explain myself. I can't tell whether it's a social anxiety or not, but whatever level you say I am in, I have problems with meeting with new people. I don't like chit-chats much, I am not good at opening up a topic in a conversation, I am the least talkative person in group chats, I cannot show the person talking to me how interested I am even if I am interested in what they are saying, I don't always look in the eyes (generally looking away and not smiling (I have an upset and angry face overall)).

So I had been in a trip with a group of I don't know, and two days ago I'd been coming back with this bus, where I had a chance to talk with this girl with whom I spent the evening at a bar, talking to her sometimes. So we sit next to each other, talked for 4 hours straight (believe me I don't know how that happened, I usually don't even talk that much with a friend of mine) then added ourselves on Instagram and WhatsApp, then slept. We even dealed that we'd go watch a movie someday. 
Today, my social awkwardness hit me once more and I couldn't find anything to talk to this nice girl. Right now I don't open WhatsApp to not send  a 'seen' to her because I don't know what to say.

I don't want to lose this cute girl because she showed that I could still be a human being who can talk to other people like normal people. What is your advice?",relationship_advice

t3_dln0r5,Should I go on a pre-planned vacation with my ex?,"My ex-boyfriend and I have a trip planned in December and a few days ago we broke up after 2 years of dating. The breakup was unexpected and not necessarily mutual, however it has been processed and accepted by both parties (it was a very logical reason and I support his decision, it was just a case of bad timing) and we are on great terms! It was a very clean and mature breakup and we plan to maintain a lifelong friendship as we both get along very well and have been there for each other during hard times in our lives. 

I want to clarify that this trip would be with his grandmother and sister, not just the two of us. I feel that the obvious answer is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go‚Äù because going on vacation with your ex is crazy, right? But I don‚Äôt feel that it would be awkward or difficult in any way and we both think it would be very fun. My concern is that I‚Äôm crazy for thinking that I can go on a trip with my ex boyfriend of 2 years as friends just two months after breaking up and be okay mentally - but I also feel that our situation is unique.  For the time being, we are keeping our distance from each other, as one should after a breakup, and I‚Äôm hoping that by December the answer is a bit more clear to me.

First off.. sorry for any mistakes. I‚Äôm on my phone and don‚Äôt often post on reddit.

I (f28) have been with my partner (m28) for just over 12 years now. For six of those years he has worked away from home. His swings have varied from two weeks on one off, four on one off and 13 days on one off. I feel like all this time apart has driven a huge wedge between us. We‚Äôre both not the same people as we were when we were 22 and we barely got to see each other through those changes. 

I‚Äôve recognised we probably haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúin love‚Äù for a while now. I feel this way because he doesn‚Äôt want to do anything with me, never compliments me, isn‚Äôt interested in any aspect of my life and gives no affection. I really noticed when I had a presentation to do for my university degree that I had been very stressed about and he didn‚Äôt even wish me luck or tune in when I tried to tell him how it went. 

Not having a partner who contributes to the relationship has taken its toll on me and I‚Äôm now doing the exact same to him. We do love each other though. We‚Äôve been such big parts of each other‚Äôs lives for so long and neither of us wants to hurt the other.. well, that‚Äôs the vibe I‚Äôm getting.

Anyway, I found out eight weeks ago that I‚Äôm pregnant. He knew from the start and I gave him a chance to voice his opinion on the matter and he just said it was my choice (on my own again). I‚Äôm needing him to be here for me more than ever and he‚Äôs just not. He messaged me (he‚Äôs currently away working) yesterday saying that he is ‚Äúiffy‚Äù about the baby and honestly I feel like that‚Äôs just the last straw for me.

How can I continue to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt love me but doesn‚Äôt want to leave me? How can I leave a relationship at 12 weeks pregnant with no safety net? Do I stick it out and hopefully we make it through the rough patch? I‚Äôm so miserable and so lonely when this should be the happiest time of my life. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

I guess what I really want from this post is some guidance. Has anyone been in a similar position who can offer some words of advice?

t3_dlt0c3,"my gf (18F) made a joke about male enlargement pills, i (18M) brushed it off. three days later she says 'i bought you something...'","the title says it all. i have a huge penis that attracts many females, but i will elaborate a bit more here:

&amp;#x200B;

on saturday, my GF (Female Acquaintance, also known to less intelligent men as Girl Friend) of two years did something that somewhat hurt my penis/destroyed my incelhood a bit. she sent me a link to some of those incel encouragement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. i thought she was just joking so I LOL'd (laughed out loud, to you normies), said no, and brushed it off. when I saw her yesterday (monday), she said ""i have something for you."" to my surprise, it wasn't deodorant, and she pulled out a bottle of... THOSE pills. real men will know what i'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

i said, ""what the frick, are you serious right now? really?"" before sputtering in the presence of my awesome male aura, she said, ""relax i'm not saying you are not big enough. i just want to choke on an extra inch or three of you. i thought you would be cool with it."" i was horrifically offended considering that was about 250% of my natural girth, so i said ""first of all, that is not for you to decide. secondly, i'm a man. why would i do that for a woman? i'm comfortable with my epic girth. lastly, IF i were to consider this as a possibility, you do know all of that is only to bait skinny soyboys, right? that stuff does not work."" she said, ""there is only one way to find out. here, take them."" i told her to leave my epic man cave immediately and have not uttered a word to her. my phone is still blowing up with texts and calls from various women, as all vaginas in a 300 mile radius were immediately made aware of my glistening male presence. from the texts and voicemails, i can tell she did not expect me to tell her to leave. i kept cool as all of this was happening because i thought she was still kidding... i mean, why would any adequate female doubt my manhood?

&amp;#x200B;

it irritates me that she did this to me. i wouldn't say she isn't happy with my size, but clearly her actions are alluding to this without her having to even say it. my question is, dear incels, am i overthinking/overreacting? i am considering ending it. she has apologized but i fear the damage to my ego is done. what she did was uncalled for and should only be done if one is insecure about their size. i still want to take advantage of her, but this stings still! should i break it off? what should I say? is there a way to recover from this?

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. i did tell her, ""OK, i will take the pills, but only if you get a boob job."" she said ""of course master, your dick is so big i cannot refuse."" üòÇ

**UPDATE/EDIT 1:** wow. this shit blew up faster than my penis if i were even remotely telling the truth right now. **MANY of you provided great feedback. THANK YOU.** yes, her and I are having a serious discussion about it tonight. i texted her during my lunch and she keeps apologizing and reminding me that no matter what she still loves me and that she should have realized i'm huge, my dear reddit friends she was crying all night. she asked if i could talk to her on phone for a min or too and i agreed. i took her call. she's devastated and said that she is scared i won't trust her nor want to be physically intimate with her. she is very upset so i calmed her down with promises of getting to look at my massive dick. i told her she's a good little slave but that this needs to be seriously discussed and find a way to move on. like many of you suggested **I WILL NOT NOR PLAN ON ADMITTING THE TRUTH ABOUT MY SMALL PENIS.** and to everyone who said she is stupid/an idiot, i agree. what she did is indeed stupid but she is pretty much like that 99% of the time. also, those of you how think this is a fake post: good job, and congratulations for being smart enough to figure out that i'm 9 years old and this is all completely false.

t3_dlmqde,My boyfriend (27M) of 5 years kissed another woman and immediately confessed,"My boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) have been dating for 5 years, live together, and adopted multiple pets as a couple. The other night he was out at a conference for work and shared an Uber with a work colleague he didn‚Äôt know very well (we live kind of on the way to where she lives from the bar). In the Uber ride this woman started kissing him and he said he knew it was wrong but he felt too drunk to push her off. He said he tried to turn his head away but felt like he couldn‚Äôt control his body very well. He told me what happened as soon as he got out of the car and stumbled inside our apartment. I feel really hurt and it feels like he cheated, but he also said he consumed 15+ drinks that night (internet search states he should have been unconscious or near death) so it kind of also feels like he was sexually assaulted. He says he feels horrible and that he wants to stop drinking altogether (he has a family history of alcoholism). When I asked to see who she is (look her up on their company website) he seemed terrified to see a picture of her, not in a way of being confronted with a mistake, but like seeing an attacker. I confronted this woman through social media, and she claims that she doesn‚Äôt remember it because she was too drunk, but when he messaged her to say that kiss was a mistake and he had a girlfriend, she responded that ‚Äúshe would never have done that if she knew‚Äù and that he ‚Äúshould have told her‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, am I overreacting being so hurt? It feels like he cheated and I always have a rule to immediately break up with cheaters, since the last time I dated one and trusted him to stop cheating after I caught him, and found out later he never stopped. But this feels really blurred between cheating and being assaulted, and I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm victim blaming him. 

Also to note - my current boyfriend never cheated on me before, I have even gone through his phone a few times and saw messages from other women clearly asking him out and him politely declining. I know this comes off as very controlling on my part but he‚Äôs let me do this because he knows I had previous relationships end where the other person is cheating and has nothing to hide.

He runs track and there's a lot of cute girls on the team. Cool! Girls are cute and that's fine. He tells me he finds a couple attractive which I find odd, because he's alway been adamant on how un-cute the girls on the team are. I feel a little uneasy and insecure. That is my own problem and I try to work on it. I express this to him and he's understanding and reassures me I'm the one for him.

One night, we have an argument and he tells me that he's going to hook up with one of them. That hurt. He tells me which ones he finds attractive (just 2 of them).

We make up. A few weeks pass and I comment on how one of the girl's has a nice butt and he says ""no, \_\_\_\_ (girl he finds attractive) has a much bigger one"". That makes me feel even more uneasy. He says it's my fault for how I feel and that I should be more secure in myself.

A few days later, I find out he took a pic with this girl (with other people) and her butt is out in front of him. I express to him that I'm uncomfortable with this girl, because there seems to be kind of a pattern here. He says it's not and it's my fault for how I feel. I told him I'd wish he would be more considerate of my feelings, because his relationship with this girl makes me uncomfortable and to give me some time to work on it.

The next day, he goes on a team trip and comes back the same day. He had a really good race! He PR'd and did so well. He hands me his phone, because he was doing something and it flashed on his screen that she followed him back on twitter. Not going to lie, I got sad. I walked off and asked why he would he do that. Less than 24 hours I asked him to give it some space. He said it's my fault for being so weird about a follow back on twitter. But I just don't get why he wants to see her day-to-day updates if she doesn't matter to him. It weirded me out and again, it was my fault for how I feel. He told me I ruined his day and that it was all my fault.

Now this is a minimal thing, but I was selling our things on marketplace on facebook. This guy was harassing me and so I just ignored him. I woke up this morning and saw that he left me a negative review and I thought it was funny. I told my boyfriend and he said ""you take things too personally."" I was just confused, like what? Why does it have to be negative thing against me?",relationship_advice
t3_dljg5t,My (23M) parents prefer my sister (17F) and the general argument is that she is younger and has a harder time.,"
Okay sorry for the length of this post. 

First some background information:
I‚Äôm 23M, and my sister is 17F and we are living in big city in Germany. She is still going to school, and im studying my Master in Computer Science. 
Our parents are not very rich but not completely poor, both are working, my dad full-time and my mum part-time. 
They always told me to appreciate the money they spend on me, and that we are definitely not rich. Also when the bought me clothes, they always gave me the feeling that I owe them something.
We had more often arguments in my childhood, but it was never really about money but mostly how much better are other children from friends of my parents.

I started working while in school with small side jobs (I was 16 years old) to finance my drivings license, because my parents told me it would be to expensive for them to pay for. 
After the drivings license, I kept working so that my parents should not have to pay so much for me and I could finance my hobbies (which were not very expensive with Skateboarding and Bouldering)-
I graduated very successfully and then started studying computer science at a university (which has been my dream since I was 12 years old). 

In Germany, you do not have any official fees for studying, but it is still expensive since I have to pay high amounts for public transport, books, materials, events for connecting with fellow students. 
This would not be possible without me working 16 hours every week as a student software developer since the beginning of my studies. It was never a problem for me. Of course, my grades were not the best and it took me 1 year longer than it is normal to complete my Bachelor.  

Like in the third semester, the conflicts with my mum got serious. She constantly complained that I did not help enough in the household. 
To be honest, for me it was impossible to work 16 hours a week and study full-time and help more in the household. 
So I moved out to my grandma, and everything was fine. I payed all my expenses and I did not need to pay rent at my grandma! (Thanks to this lovely woman, she is 90 years old and the best!)
In Germany, parents gets around 200‚Ç¨ per month for the child from the gov. They keep the money although I am legally entitled to get the money. We still had contact, I visited them almost every weekend.

Then, they bought a horse for my sister for 10.000‚Ç¨ and pay her monthly riding lessons and accommodation for the horse (which is several hundred euros a month). I was like: Okay‚Ä¶ 
We then had some discussions on the fairness of the situation (me working while studying and my sister going to school and getting everything, including the driving license payed). 
Always, the outcome was it is not unfair since my sister has a harder time in school, and that the riding is a family thing (which is not true, since my sister only allows herself to ride the horse). 
They always drive her to school, and drive her to the horse with the car. In my teenage years, I needed to drive to my hobbies with the public transport and paid for it myself. 

Anyways, I got my bachelor and their reaction was only: come on, let's have a glass of sparkling wine at dinner, and that I should not take off, because I still have no master. 

The Weekend three weeks before, I was visiting my parents with my girlfriend. Out of nowhere, my mum started ignoring both of us in the morning. 
(Regarding my girlfriend, she is a very kind girl, coming from an higher class family, and was never demanding or anything. Over the time, my mum dropped comments that my lifestyle got more expensive since I‚Äôm together with her, which is correct, but it is my money and I can do with it whatever I want)
I‚Äôve asked several times, what was wrong, but no real reaction.
Then it became too much for me, and I packed our things, went to my grandmother and since then have no contact with my parents.

So what should I do now? I‚Äôm feeling like I worked my ass of and my sister gets everything from my parents.",relationship_advice
t3_dlhpm6,Afraid my new boyfriend will turn on me like my abusive ex,"My (23F) ex boyfriend was an awful human being. We were together just about 3 years and have been broken up for 3 years. He was verbally, mentally, and sexually abusive to me. He would scream at me for nothing, pin me against the wall and yell in my face when I did nothing wrong, cheat on me every chance he got (we're talking 50+ times with at least 7 people I know of), stole sentimental items from me and sell them for weed money, and just be a general piece of trash. He had some of the worst anger I've ever seen and was so manipulative. Eveything was my fault. I couldn't go a day without being made to feel like I was worthless. He would scream at me for hours, calling all the names, and then when he was done he would tell me to ""stop being a little bitch"" for crying and i had no reason yo be upset because if I wasn't such a ""worthless cunt"" he wouldn't have to yell at me.

When we eventually broke up, I took 3 years off of dating to work on myself. I moved out into my own place, bought my first car, got a new job, became financially independent, and was truly happy for the first time in my life. I worked really hard to get to where i am now and im so proud of the progress I've made. 

A few months ago, i decided I was ready to open myself up to someone again. That's when i met him. My new boyfriend (23M) is absolutely incredible. He's patient, kind, understanding, and everything my ex wasn't. He treats me the way I always should have been and I'm so thankful I met him. It's early in the relationship, but I already feel in my heart that I'm going to marry this man one day. 

Here's where the trouble starts though. As my walls have begun to break down with my new boyfriend, I've realized I never dealt with the trauma my ex put me through. Though my new boyfriend has given me no reason to think he would ever cheat on me, i was convinced he was because some girl I didn't know commented heart eyes emojis on his Instagram pictures. My new boyfriend has a ton of friends who are girls and he goes out of his way to make me feel comfortable and know they arent a threat, but I still feel like they are. The idea that a guy can have platonic friendships with girls is a foreign concept to me because every girl my ex ever talked to he was either fucking or trying to fuck. I would never ever want to tell him to stop talking to any of them because that's an awful controlling thing to do, but it makes me so nervous to see girls names on his phone all the time.

Though my boyfriend and I haven't had a fight yet, I'm terrified he will explode in rage like my ex did. Ive already noticed that i keep my mouth shut about things with him because I'm conditioned to think if I bring up something i will get screamed at. I'm constantly hiding how I feel out of fear that he will leave me or scream at me. 

I'm so furious at my ex. Because of him, im scared I might lose this amazing man that I have the privilege of being with now. My boyfriend is everything I could have ever wanted and i dont want to push him away because im scared he will turn on me. 

I talked to my best friend and my mom last night about all this. My best friend helped me calm down a ton, validating that with what i went through its 100% understandable to be hurt and cautious. I told my mom i want to go back to therapy so i can talk with someone about the trauma i was put through. I never really dealt with what happened, just pushed it away. 

All I want is to be happy again and unafraid. I love my boyfriend and I really think hes the one, but he wont be the one if I keep making myself think he's going to act like my ex. If any of you have been in this situation or similar, any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for reading and listening.",relationship_advice

We mainly hang out in a group call on discord but every time I add him to the group he completely dominates the call and it‚Äôs near impossible for anyone to get a single word in. Every time he‚Äôs added we all regret it because it‚Äôs basically like BUCKLE UP you‚Äôre on the fucking U show and it‚Äôs literally just us sitting there listening to him talk and no matter how bored we act he just keeps going and going and going. 

He‚Äôs gotten into tabletop gaming recently so that‚Äôs his new favorite thing to talk about and it‚Äôs actually so fucking annoying because he‚Äôll give us a second by second re-telling of his last session with a painful amount of detail like to the point where I want to punch the shit out of him. I want to support his new interest because I like fantasy, magic, etc too but my god he just won‚Äôt stop shoving it down your throat.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a lot of anxiety about confronting him and it‚Äôs stressing me out tbh. Obviously I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings as he‚Äôs one of my oldest friends but it‚Äôs getting worse and I think I just need to do something before someone else says something or there's an argument. There are already a few friends that will just leave if there‚Äôs any talk of U joining. I feel responsible because he‚Äôs my friend‚Ä¶ I bring him into the call. I should say something to him so he can try to realize what hes doing and to spare anyone else from dealing with this any longer.

Up until now I‚Äôve tried change the subject repeatedly hoping that maybe he would get a hint. I‚Äôve tried using one of my bad moods to be like STOP TALKING about -insert game- and continued to joke about how he will never shut the fuck up about it‚Ä¶ like presenting it as a joke. I‚Äôve also tried acting incredibly bored with whatever he‚Äôs saying- not responding, yawning loudly. He STILL keeps going. I try to suggest okay lets just play something really quickly and hope that he‚Äôll make call outs or something. So then we‚Äôll all play a game together and he‚Äôll decide to spend ten years explaining a mechanic or counters related to the game that is basic knowledge/everyone is experienced with‚Ä¶ again with insane amounts of unnecessary detail. No one else can talk. We just sit there getting talked at.

t3_dlmjto,"Today, my crush (18F) sent me (19M) a text saying that she doesn't want to date me since she is afraid of getting hurt and doesn't want to mess up our friendship, even though she has a crush on me as well.","Yesterday we were chilling in my car and talking, and she said that because of past relationships she doesn't want to go into another one, since she has gotten her heart broken after every relationship.

Today I was texting her and she sent this ""Can we just not date and just keep the way things are going now like really slow and just friendly but like we still really vibe"" I responded to that saying, that I want to be okay with that, but I really am not, since I like her and I don't know if I could act the same way, knowing that nothing would come of it, but I would respect her wishes, then she said ""I just don't want to hurt out great friendship"" Which is what she said when I initially told her that I liked her. The pessimist in me is saying that's just her way of saying I don't like you, but the optimist is saying that she did say she had a crush on me, so I should find a way to show her that I won't hurt her.  
It may be worth noting that her best friend really wants us to date, and that her exes were all Jerks (her best friends words, not mine)

So basically long distance doesn‚Äôt have much to do with this because I do trust him with all my heart and I know he‚Äôs not cheating. BUT, I do have bad anxiety in general which causes me to freak out and over-analyze things that mean almost nothing. 

So at the beginning of college, he‚Äôd text me A LOT and be very attentive and affectionate and always text good morning and good night. Then a few weeks later, it slowed down and he wasn‚Äôt texting me all day until like 11pm... was leaving me on read and delivered for days..... yadda yadda and I briefly brought it up and he said something like ‚Äúbaby I love you so much, if not MORE than I did before. I‚Äôm not trying to ignore you or make you upset, I‚Äôve just been extremely busy with schoolwork!‚Äù And of course I believed that and I still do believe that. 

However, this past September-October he‚Äôs been SO good at texting me every single morning because I‚Äôd dm him a meme or whatever and he‚Äôd wake up, see it, react to it, and then text me a very sappy cute lovey good morning text LIKE USUAL!!!! Like how it used to be and always has been, right?

Well yesterday and sent a good morning text, then I woke up 3 hours later and sent a text back, he read it 8 hours later and didn‚Äôt reply. So I snapped him 2 hours after he had read it and it took him 3 hours to reply to that even tho he was uploading to his snapchat story and he snapped saying something like ‚Äúhi angel I just finished an essay I love you so much and I‚Äôll be dreaming the sweetest dreams of you‚Äù 
AND THEN we talked for about 20 mins and he passed out so my text is still delivered on his snap and he hasn‚Äôt opened it.... but he read my Instagram dm this morning and didn‚Äôt reply or like it or anything and hasn‚Äôt talked to me and it‚Äôs now the late afternoon...?????

t3_dlj9a8,Need some urgent advice about my realtionship,"Hi guys, I usually dont do anything like this but I think I really need advice from people who are more experienced in relationships. Me and my gf are 19 years old and we have been together for almost 4 years now, our relationship has been good and I do not regret spending time with her, this is the first serious relationship for both of us and I think I do not want to be with her anymore.

I would like to think iam a good guy I have always stayed faithful to her and would never want to hurt her, but recently I want to say over the last year I just stopped seeing a future together, I cant really say why but it's something that just happened. She is very sensitive so it's hard to speak about problems with her because she often starts crying and that just makes me feel bad and it's always when we are trying to have a serious conversation about our relationship so whatever I say just tends to get brushed away.

I'am not trying to push the blame on her for this relationship not working we both have our problems, but she has just become so needy always wanting to know what I'm doing, where iam, she constantly texts me, tries to stay over my house almost 24/7 it feels like I get no time for myself or my friends and I think that has pushed me away I have tried speaking about it and it just gets brushed away.

And recently I have had this gut feeling that we just need to break up, recently we were out in town and what happened pushed me to try and break up. That night she was with her friends and I was with mine and we agreed that we would have a separate night, but she ignored what we agreed on and just kept calling me and texting almost the whole night which made me feel crap cause i couldn't properly spend time with my friends, and I give her almost all of my free time it just makes me feel like she is in control of me. That same night although iam not proud of it and I feel really guilty I danced with another girl and it made me feel so good but I left the club almost immediately after feeling bad about the situation. The next day she found out about it but it didnt really affect me she wanted to speak about it and we did, I said what was on my mind and I apologized and she was mad but did forgive me, then I used this opportunity to try and say that I dont want to be with her anymore and that I dont have the same feelings towards her anymore, right after she started crying said that she noticed a difference in me, she was uncontrollable it looked like she was in physical pain which made me cry aswell seeing her like that broke my heart so I took a step back and said ""maybe we can make this work"" it took a while for her to calm down and then she started to make me feel really guilty saying that she couldn't live without me, that she doesnt know what she would do if I was gone and said alot more which just made me feel preassured into taking her back.

t3_dlmidg,Is it a good idea to open up my marriage? Husband interested in sexual variety (29m) (25f),"My husband is a great man but I can tell that he desires other women. At first I was incredibly uncomfortable with even the idea of masturbation, not to mention an open relationship, but I guess it grew on me. I'm with him in this union, so I should be trying to make him as happy as he can be, right? I on the other hand don't need sexual variety so I wouldn't even be interested in exploring a 2way open relationship. Just want to make sure that the man that decided to be with me is happy on his death bed!

Now the idea with prostitutes came to me when imagining my husband with a mistress almost made me barf. I couldn't have him potentially open up to someone other than me, in my head that is the definition of intimacy of a relationship. Prostitutes, on the other hand, are there to get the job done, then leave. They need no courting or effort - this makes me super comfortable. We can afford it financially and I think that if I added a clause that he can only see each prostitute once, that would make the headache go away.

That's where it went wrong. After the meal we were watching a series and she said something and jokingly I said ""if you keep doing that, I'll leave"", but really jokingly.

t3_dlmfxv,"Cutting off a friend without there being a ""big fight""","I've been friends with this girl since middle school and we were really close for a few years before drifting off to different groups due to interests. My dad and her mom went to school together too so she's also been a ""family friend."" This is where I get confused on the best way to go about this.

We basically grew up hanging out with different people and would occassionally meet up for one on one time. It's been less frequent now because I'm out of the country for school (but just over the border so I'll still come back every couple months.) These one on one hang outs have been ok I guess. Sometimes it'll feel nice to catch up but for the most part I always leave feeling like maybe we didn't need to do it. The visits are usually just her venting about problems and talking about her friends. Which, inherently, doesn't bother me. But then if I bring up my issues, the subject is changed or she just blatantly laughs and moves on. Not a great feeling.

The relationship feels very one sided and really just not necessary for me. I believe that the dynamics of a relationship shift and move over time with one person giving and one taking a little more, but I've never felt like things have ever switched for us. I'm essentially her therapist every few months and I don't get to speak.

The last straw(s) for me were when I went through an extremely hard and difficult time in my life and I got the above ""lol of course it would happen to you"" and then moving on. Never asking for a follow up to the situation. And then my last visit.

I drove 5+ hours to spend a couple days with my friend before seeing family. I get there and I was excited to meet some of her new friends. Well the whole trip was basically her inviting anybody she could think of over. At first, this seemed nice ""oh I can meet them"" but then it became clear that she just didn't really want to hang out with me. She wanted somebody else there. Because all I got was a ""this is my friend idkwhattoputhere2319"" before the existing friends sat in a corner talking about drama etc. about people I didn't know. Trying to force myself into the conversation hardly worked and the new friends felt no need to get to know me despite me trying to ask them questions. To top it off they kept getting high throughout the day despite my friend knowing I don't smoke. Generally I don't care if others do, but I kinda felt like ""if I'm only here for a day and a half couldn't you wait to get high so I'm included in the activities?"" It was just an overall bummer. I basically got to sit around and watch best friends smoke together. I literally could have left and it wouldn't have changed their plans or how they acted. So I did. I made an excuse about going to my parents early for something and drove the rest of the way, getting home around 2am.

After all of this, I realized that she just hasn't really been a good friend to me. I'm in no way perfect. I have a hard time communicating via text (it's overwheleming because of my depression) but when I'm in person I give that person my full attention and make sure they're included. After thinking and always generally feeling upset by the dynamics of this friendship, I've decided that I just don't really want to continue it anymore.

If she's not a good friend to me and maybe I'm not the best friend to her because of my texting issues, then why go on? I don't want a dramatic blowup or anything, especially because our parents know each other (though they don't really hang out now that kids are grown.) But my friend seems to still think we're friends (obviously) and I don't know how to move on without making it a big thing.

I feel like she'll feel blindsided if I say that I've been unhappy and don't really want to be friends but ghosting feels rude.

Added issue: we have an active group chat with my family + her (family friends) but I feel like it would be weird for me to just leave it but I feel like it would be difficult to really cut ties and move on if it's still active.

Tl;Dr: Done being friends even though (in her eyes) there's no bad blood or drama. Don't know how to stop being friends without creating an unnecessary issue. Families are friends (but only semi close and mostly because of us.)",relationship_advice
t3_dlmfvm,"I have been single for over a year, until I decided to try Tinder, but now confusion is hitting me like a ton of bricks?","To start this off, as noted, I have been single for a year now. I haven‚Äôt really been going out of my way to talk to men. In fact, I have messages upon messages from both Facebook and Instagram from men trying to ‚Äúwoo‚Äù me that I have ignored... nonetheless, I was bored one day and decided to see what Tinder had to offer me. There weren‚Äôt really any high expectations when I created my profile, but I got a lot of hits. I would say I‚Äôm fairly attractive, so this was expected.

Anyways, I had come across someone I thought was incredibly cute. We hit it off messaging back and forth immediately. He freshly turned 21, and I (female,) had just turned 24. For the course of a month, he and I went on dating, and even had sleepovers at both of our homes (I waited till the third time meeting him for this.) On top of that, we had both met each other‚Äôs parents and siblings. 

I thought he really liked me, being that he would say it all the time! One thing that had me really confused, though, was that every time we‚Äôd wrap up a sleepover or we would just be cuddling while watching movies, he‚Äôd tell me something along the lines of: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre still talking to me.‚Äù I‚Äôd ask him why he would say that, but he could never really give me a definitive answer. I thought, maybe I just intimidate him because on top of being fairly pretty, I have a lot going for me in the smarts department.

Over the course of seeing each other, we would message each other every day via Snapchat. It surprised me he‚Äôd never ask to message anywhere else, so that was a bit of a red flag. He‚Äôd always, always message me first with cute, little good morning texts. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was head-over-heels for him, but I was starting to like him quite a bit.

All of a sudden, last week, he stopped messaging me as much. Then there came a day when he didn‚Äôt message me at all? And when he finally resurfaced, he told me he had gotten really sick from something he ate at work. I told him I hoped he felt better.

Before that message came in though, I had noted I wanted to get rid of my Snapchat. It just didn‚Äôt really do anything for me. Fast forward to when he messaged me that he was feeling under the weather, he waited another whole 24 hours to message me again. He touched on the fact that I wanted to delete my Snapchat and said he would like to keep contact, that he really liked me, and that he wasn‚Äôt ghosting me. I replied with something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI like you a lot and I know we‚Äôre taking things slow, but I am wanting something serious.‚Äù That message was left unread for three days, and I don‚Äôt sit around waiting for guys, so without messaging him again or providing him with a way to find me, I just deleted my Snapchat.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown: prior to him, I was in an abusive relationship for five years. I stuck around because I was blackmailed or would get the shit beaten out of me if I tired to leave. Finally, I worked up the courage to leave him and drove cross country back to my home state. Needless to say, I have a lot of baggage.

The ex is still stalking me through social media and doing his best to make my life a living hell (this aided in my decision to get rid of my social media all across the board.) I had told the guy I was dating about my ex and about the severity of the situation, and he seemed a bit spooked, but he stuck around...

Anyway, my question is, should I reach out to the guy via FB messenger? I deleted my Facebook, but kept messenger as a means for some people to contact me. Or is that whole not messaging me for three days a message within itself? He would still post to his story, which kind of made me think he was blatantly ignoring me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmfv6,Addiction to attention/affection? Open or stay closed?,"I (F 25) have never been able to orgasm while having sex or by traditional masturbation. (toys, fingers, oral, blah blah ((I can only get myself off with sytrabation of whatever it's called when you squeeze your legs together til the nice tingle happens))

The biggest road block has to be my mentality. I'm incredibly self conscious 24/7 and definitely don't love myself or the way I look. Also a Virgo so yeah.
I'm pretty comfortable with my bf mostly. Never been able to be so open with anyone in my entire life, but I'm still reserved and calculating with my words and actions. Opening up in incredibly difficult for me.
I'm too embarrassed to try to coach him or let him know what I like. I'm also a people pleaser and just try to focus on him. I like to keep my eyes closed and I hate when the lights are on and I'm exposed. 
Lately I've thought more and more about wanting to have an open relationship to see if someone else can magically make me cum. Our relationship is perfect companion wise and I don't want an actual relationship with anyone else, but sextually I am just not happy at all. And I have a coworker who is very into me and knows about all my problems. Would never want to date him but I want to experience being desired and something new and different. I might have some sort of addiction to affection? I crave and need people to like me WHICH I HATE MYSELF FOR FEELING.

Just need some kind of advice. Also open to any and and all questions.

TLDR I can't orgasm. I want an added sextual partner possibly.",relationship_advice

While I‚Äôm there, they seem to like me and also show me respect, but my girlfriend has told me that they felt I have been disrespectful to them and they don‚Äôt think i am right for her. Here are a couple of reasons she said they felt I was disrespectful: I leaned on the back of the couch while talking to them at one point(I kinda understand this), I put my arm around her(also understand because she is an only child and we had only been seeing each other for a week), I almost walked into her room while her friends were back there(I also understand this), I had a college assignment do so I finished it while there(also kinda understand). Her mother has also said that she thinks I‚Äôm a good and sweet guy but she said that I don‚Äôt look at her the way other guys have and she doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the one she is going to marry. I told my gf that I think I should sit down and have a respectful conversation with them but she said she thinks that will only make it worse and told me that there is nothing I can really do to change their minds.

Not sure if this goes here or where I should ask but here it is lol :) . So I've been doing some research and aside from taking a test soon just wanted to get someone's opinion. I think my M(29) gf F(26) might be pregnant. She had her tubes tied but that isn't %100 apparently. I dont know why but I assumed it was a full proof birth control. We have a pretty active sex life together and a couple weeks ago she was complaining about soreness in her breasts along with growing in size slightly. At first we just thought it may be her period coming. A week later she said that she thought her period is coming due to slightly clear spotting was happening. But it's been over a week since then. She is feeling more hormonal than  she  would usually be. Certain smells turn her off completely and nausea and exhaustion seem to be an everyday occurence. We we are intimate she complains of soreness like her vagina feels to tight. And the cravings she has are like a bear hibernating haha  the tenderness in her breasts are to the point where they just to even be brushed or grazed lightly and and holes forming. All very strange and abnormal for both of us. At first she thought it just might be a bad period on the way but now we are both convinced.

t3_dlmboo,Let's talk open relationships,"So about a week ago my gf hinted at an open relationship by saying ""I could see myself in a open relationship."" I didn't know how to respond so I replied with ""maybe I could to"" It's not something I'm against, but probably never would have considered it. Part of feels like it could be fun and part of me doesn't really care for it. At first I thought ""Am I not enough?"" ""Does someone who ask for such a thing deserve me?"" even though we both have a very good sexual life and rarely ever do not get to ""finish"". We were both virgins before we met so after more thought I understood where she was coming from, especially since she is attracted to girls and has never had the chance to be with one, but does want to include guys as well.

t3_dlmbgd,How do I [F] apologize to my ex [M] and best friend?,"My ex and I dated for pretty much a year. Throughout that year, we got really close. We broke it off due to my own reasons, and while he didn't agree with my decision at first, he's come to see that we aren't the best for each other. Nonetheless, we remain very close friends, if not best friends. 

However, one of the reasons why I had decided to break up with him was because he had messaged a girl on Instagram about a month into our relationship. When I found out, he says his intentions were pure and he simply wanted to make a new friend. I was really hurt by it, but when I wanted to address it then and there, he told me to simply trust him and that he really didn't mean anything bad by it. I've caught him lying about what actually happened regarding this issue to some of his friends, which I noted as a red flag; if he hadn't done anything bad, then he should have no reason to paint the narrative as something else. 

During the span of our relationship whenever I wanted to truly address the issue, he would simply brush it off and would be super upset; so me not wanting to put him in a negative mood, I just let it go; but the nagging feeling never really left me. 

Just today we were chilling (we have now broken up) and we got back onto this topic regarding him messaging the other girl while we were still dating. I guess my emotions just sort of overwhelmed me, and I asked him straight if his intentions were truly to just ""make a new friend"". I don't know how it happened, but then as a retort in the middle of the conversation I said, ""I guess I just feel like your second choice after you decided to message \[the girl\] . It sucks because I could have dated Josh if I hadn't dated you.""

Josh was a mutual friend that, prior to me dating my ex, I genuinely believed  was the perfect guy. But he never seem interested so I just didn't pursue anything with him.  It was only until after I broke up with my ex that a friend of mine told me he actually liked me and wanted to ask me out, but because I was always with my ex, he didn't want to ruin anything between him and I (though we weren't even dating yet then). 

Immediately when I said this, I regretted it. He got super upset and asked me to leave. I know no matter how upset I felt, I shouldn't have said this. I don't know how to even go about apologizing to him. If I'm still so hurt by what he did, does this mean that I still love my ex? Should I have not even brought such an old argument up? I can't help but feel at fault here and I feel so, so bad for hurting his feelings like this. Does this just mean we need space and we really should not be hanging out as much as we are now that we've broken up? I don't know what to do; he is still my best friend and I genuinely care about him so much.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmbb2,Ex?,"My ex and I broke up 7 months ago. It ended horribly.Shortly after he started dating one of my friends. Throughout the 7 months and their relationship he and I continued to sleep together. And then a few days later one of us (most him) would tell the other to never speak to the other again. That would last for a couple of week and then we‚Äôd talk, fuck, cry and do it all over again.
Well we got into a fight last night/this morning and he came over to talk. I kept saying I couldn‚Äôt sleep with him but when it truly comes down to it I cave and fuck him. I just miss the closeness.

t3_dlesga,My [33M] wife [33F] is not willing to discuss how we discuss things,"And our current way of discussing things is not working, as she never wan't to discuss disagreements or give an inch. She just want me to do it her way. Let me give you an example:

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday night we were discussing whether going to spinning would decrease my sperm count (because of the heat). I wanted to go, but she thought I should make the sacrifice for us (as she phrased it) of not going this one time as she is scheduled to ovulate a couple of days later and we are trying to make a baby.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I was going to go as spinning in my opinion doesn‚Äôt decrease my sperm count and that she was welcome to send me articles that proved differently. She didn‚Äôt like that very much and couldn‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt just do as she asked me ‚Äì for us.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this morning. I‚Äôm all for airing out the apartment in the morning, but she wanted all the windows open longer that I thought was necessary, so I tell her: After 10 minutes of airing out there‚Äôs no addition effect, so we might as well close the windows before the building is cooled down and we have to spending additional and unnecessary energy to warm it up.

&amp;#x200B;

She says she disagrees but that‚Äôs I‚Äôm welcome to send her articles that supports my claim.

&amp;#x200B;

I go on google and the first page of search results from different source all say a version of: Air out 2-3 times a day, for 5 to 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

I send her 5 links with a brief summary of each link and instead of changing her mind like she had promised me she gets very angry. Now she doesn‚Äôt wanna change her mind because ‚Äúshe likes feeling the outside inside‚Äù and tells me: ‚ÄúWhen you leave the apartment, I‚Äôm going to leave the windows open for an hour‚Äù. It‚Äôs fall here and 10 degrees Celsius outside.

&amp;#x200B;

I then told her that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that she says ‚Äúprove it‚Äù and when I do she still doesn‚Äôt wanna change her mind or even discuss it. But she wasn‚Äôt even having that discussion with me, so here I am with probably the biggest issue of our relationship: We can‚Äôt discuss things and we can‚Äôt even discuss have to discuss things in an appropriate manner.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get her to talk to me about how we talk?

t3_dlfoqs,I (19M) don't know what to do or think about my GF's (24F) mental health situation.,"I somehow always get banned for not following so me rule on Reddit even though I read them every time. I hope this time I can actually get through so I might learn what I can or should do. I a 19 Y.O. male met my girlfriend 24 Y.O. MTF transgender online. We played an online mmo where we first met each other. Geographically we are in different time zones she being CST me being PST. We had been communicating online daily for weeks as we grew slightly closer together. She is fairly far from vanilla and loved to be a sub, at the time and now I didn't know too much about being a Dom but I looked into it watched videos read articles to get a better understanding. As we moved into a more official relationship thinks grew more and more sexual roleplaying a ""master/pet"" idea if you will. One of her biggest attracting factors to me was her energy of wanting to teach and help understand as well as it lay the truth out there and have a true discussion of our relationship. Never belittled or grew enraged or forced her thought process upon me, I thought and still do think those are signs of having a operational and healthy relationship. There have been times as we played games together I would ask her openly, ""are you satisfied with our relationship?, What is xyz about BDSM why is it so?.. what do you think I should work on in my relationship skills? "" All of which she proclaimed people get angry at if you ask them. Which blew me away. She never did. And always helped me to understand. Then one day like any other she messages ""hey can we talk about something"" to which having been asked by both sides multiple times was normalized. Had no second thoughts untill she wrote "" I don't think I'm in a mentally stable enough place to maintain this relationship"" was what she said. So I've come to this Reddit to try and find advice as to what I should do or tell or not do and not tell her. I want to maintain the relationship, but I think mental health issues can be a large road block. As off today she has put a ""brake"" on our relationship. What should I do? What should I say? How can I choose to support her if im not even sure it will work? Is this a test of my faith? Am I just overthinking it? Let me know please and thank you.",relationship_advice

Ever since I met him, there is something about him that intrigued me (he‚Äôs not physically hot ). Obviously as the year passed, my curiosity grew and I developed a crush on him. I did not do anything as I did not want to be inappropriate, and I thought I would just get over it eventually like every other teacher. Summer passed after that year and nothing changed, I could not get him out of my head. Once I got back to university, I followed him on twitter. After we liked and commented on each others tweets for a while, I messaged him replying to one of his tweets, and he asked me out for coffee on campus. We went out, and at that point it was the end of second year so a day after I saw him I went back home for 3 months. I texted him again recently and he asked me out for coffee again. I saw him twice the past week around campus and my heart was beating so fast I could not even go up to him and say hi. For the past three years, I could not for the life of me stop thinking about him. 

During the interactions and outings we had, he kept giving me mixed signals. He would compare me to his younger brother or make it a point that he talks with other students, etc..but he is the one who keeps asking me to go out, AFTER I initiate the conversation though. I don‚Äôt know if he is Interested, and is scared to say anything or if he is not interested and just trying to be a mentor. Usually when Im unsure I would not say anything and get over it, but I doubt after three years Im just going to get over it. Im also scared that the more I sit on it, the more obsessed I become because I have built this magical imaginary image of him on my head.

It‚Äôs really all I can think about it, I don‚Äôt know if I should just say something to get it out of my head, or if I should just sit on it till I get to know him more and this magical image of him shatters and I realise there is something about him that is really annoying and get over it.

t3_dlm90d,Am I ready for marriage?,"Hi, 

I am 21M, I have been with my girlfriend (21) for 3 years now. She is Brazilian and I‚Äôm Irish, we live here in Ireland. For her culture, traditionally people get married young and she has said this many times so I feel like it‚Äôs getting close to the right time to propose to her. I really want to. I want to spend my life with her, I have no doubt about that. 

Financially, I could be in a better situation. I have enough saved to buy her a nice engagement ring, but since I am in my final year of college, I am only working part-time so I don‚Äôt make a lot of money. I would be spending all my savings on a ring and then have to start saving from scratch on part-time wages to start getting ready for marriage. 

On top of this, it has been my life long dream to spend some time travelling, even to go backpacking for a year in Australia or New Zealand once I finish college. This is also a big expense and isn‚Äôt something that I could afford to do if I was to propose to her now. She has said she would like to do it with me but once we are married and settled it‚Äôs an opportunity that I feel will pass us by.

The most worrying thing for me is that I don‚Äôt feel like I am mature enough yet. Although I am more mature than most of my friends, I have a problem when it comes to alcohol. When I go out drinking with friends, we go to a club or something, I allow myself to get so drunk that I can‚Äôt help myself with other girls. It has only happened a handful of times (3, exactly) but I have kissed 3 different girls while being in this relationship simply because I was overly drunk and not even aware of my own actions. 

Each time I would wake up the next morning when I had sobered up a bit and be completely disgusted with myself. It‚Äôs true, I simply lack the self control to stop this kind of thing from happening, any time it happened it would only last for a couple of seconds before I realised what I was doing and pulled myself away from the girl. It meant nothing to me but  I still let it happen and I can‚Äôt forgive myself for it. I don‚Äôt want to consider myself a cheater but I am. I did this more than once and I can‚Äôt take it back. 

How can I expect to propose to this beautiful and amazing girl when I am not even able to control myself yet? I know most people will say here that I am definitely not ready, but there‚Äôs nothing I want more and I feel like I really want to do it as soon as I can.",relationship_advice

t3_dlfmro,My [17F] girlfriend [17F] is severly suicidal and I don't know what to do,"I met this girl some maybe four months ago on a dating app. We got closer and closer until she asked me out some two months ago and we started dating. I knew she was struggling with mental disorders before we've started the relationship. I didn't mind because I have a chronic mental disorder since childhood too.

 However, in the last month I realised just how bad her condition is. She texted me one night that she took some pills and now is worried that she was gonna die. Then she stopped answering my messages. I stayed up worried for so long, and ended up texting her friends to check on her. I would have called her parents, but I don't know them. I would have checked up on her on her but she lives in another city and I can't drive. She also lives alone, so nobody is there to take care of her. Her friends checked in the morning. She texted me and apologised. Said she does impulsive things when sad. Wemade a plan to mention it to her therapist. She got put on new meds and seemed to be doing alright since.

Today, I texted her good morning like i usually do. She texted me that shes had a mental breakdown and will probably admit herself into psychiatric care again. I was in school when that happened and felt like puking and crying immediately. I don't know what to do. I don't think I can be with this one in some condition. I can't be scared for her life every week. I know its not her fault, but I don't feel like I'm strong enough for that. And that it would break me after a few months of living like this.

On the other hand, I feel like I can't break up with her while shes in the psych ward. While shes in this condition. That its selfish from me to run at the first signs of trouble. I'm afraid that me leaving might be her final straw. So very afraid of that. Her ex left her while she was there, and thats still a very bitter memory for her.

t3_dlm45h,My GF (28F) and I (27M) are having way different libido's. And I don't know how to deal with it.,"First, sorry for any English mistake, I ain't a native speaker. 

I had been in a relationship for almost three years with this amazing girl and living together since February. Our sex life used to be amazing, even by the time we lived in different cities. But, since when we got to live together its been downhill. At first, it seemed everything would be like before, we had sex a few times a week and was always good, then she started to be always tired, and the frequency started to slow down every week until we end up having sex once in a month, or three weeks when I'm lucky. And that's not the only problem. She's getting very conservative about sex, don't wanna different positions or experiences, just regular mom and dad sex.

I tried to talk to her, but she gets very evasive when I bring it up. She's only open to talk about after having sex, says that she missed the time we do it more frequently, but that she doesn't feel the desire to do it unless that I get her horny by preliminary sex. And there goes another problem, I try to 'seduce' her almost every day, but she doesn't seem interested, if I try to kiss her she will  peck my lips and push me away, if try to massage her and start from there she will stop me the moment I get beyond the regular massage zone. Everything I do to make her excited she will just stop me or push me away and start to do anything else. 

She guarantees that the problem is her libido and not her attraction to me, that she still loves me as man, but don't feel any desire to do anything. And I can see that she's been sincere. But that doesn't make me feel any better. I feel really frustrated because I love her and I'm very attracted to her, I love every line on her body and don't wanna be with anybody else. But this is starting to affect our relationship, every time she pushes me away I get more frustrated. And I can't understand how she says that she misses the time our sex life was good but don't make any effort to rebound that.

My question is, how do I talk to her without being a douch or seem like I'm demanding sex?",relationship_advice

t3_dlm2ro,Ever feel like you want to relapse to a darker place because you realize someone will never like you?,"Guy here into another guy (he‚Äôs lgbt too)

I was really into this acquaintance/friend and still am. I care about him a lot, but I‚Äôm gradually realizing he‚Äôs never going to be into me. I gave up drinking because he doesn‚Äôt drink, I tried to get into better shape, tried to get into things he was passionate about so I could have more meaningful conversations with him. But all this for naught.

No matter what though, he hasn‚Äôt given me the same attention I‚Äôve given him. My friends (not mutual) tell he‚Äôs rarely initiated conversation. I also asked him to get me something to add to a collection I have while he went away on vacation (that I‚Äôd give him money for), and he forgot. If he truly cared for me, he wouldn‚Äôt have needed a reminder.

Maybe I‚Äôm setting my expectations too high, maybe not. I need to distract myself and might have to take the plunge and eventually cut him out of my life. This is hard and I‚Äôm feeling low about it.",relationship_advice

In the beginning i would always to message her here and there to see how she is doing, but always got 1 word no responses but i didnt mind since she told me she had no time. Fast forward 2 Weeks, she messages me with ""we need to talk"" and tells me after the 2 weeks no contact she doesnt know if she has feelings for me anymore and she needs some more time to think and after the exams are over she will decide weither she still has feelings or not. I was in shock and realy hearthbroken and i wanted to give her the time, but after 2 days i couldnt ""hold it"" and asked her to decide right now, because i kinda tought she would say yes, because the realtionship was realy good and all the things she said about her feelings towards me and how she never had those feelings anywere elsebut then she told me ""Okay if you want me to decide right now, i have to say no, im sorry"".

Now her Exams are over and im thinking about asking her again if the answer still remains the same, Should I?

t3_dlm0w4,I(24f) need help regaining my trust back from my BF(25m),"Sooo some back story. My boyfriend and I really hit it off when I first met him back in June and it‚Äôs been great ever since. In one month we were exclusive and I was very happy that we made things official. He had dated someone perviously 8 months prior and I actually knew her from a couple years ago through a mutual a friend and she was nice to me but I always kept my distance because she was doing some shady things with our mutual friend even though she had a boyfriend. I don‚Äôt know if she ever cheated but I saw her sit on our mutual friend‚Äôs lap when her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt around. 

The day we decided to make things exclusive I asked him about his ex(they were never exclusive). They saw each other briefly for 4-5 months but he had a really hard time getting over her. After they decided to end things mutually she ended up marrying her supposedly ‚Äúex boyfriend‚Äù a couple of weeks after they ended things in November 2018. This leads me to believe she was probably cheating on her boyfriend while he was in California for something. I think it may have been for work when they were hanging out those months. I asked my BF if he still had feelings for her and he said ‚Äú99.9%‚Äù I don‚Äôt. I was shook because when we were getting to know each other and I he was telling me the whole story about her I asked him TWICE if he was over her and he said I‚Äôm completely over her but that night he gave me the ‚Äú99.9% sure.‚Äù He said he would mute her and unmute on social media platforms and messaging to get over her but I told him he didn‚Äôt to block her to get over her. It‚Äôs not healthy to see her with someone else and it was obviously torturing him. He thought blocking her was harsh so unfollowed her on everything except Instagram. This made me very insecure because I felt like he was leaving a door open for her and I told him I couldn‚Äôt move further with him and that I wasn‚Äôt going to sit around and help him get over someone. We talked some more and I decided to keep moving forward and see where this takes me but I told him if she comes up again you need to tell me and be open.

A few weeks later he posted a picture of us on Instagram and I had this hunch that maybe his ex messaged him. The next day I asked and he said ‚Äúyes, she messaged me yesterday.‚Äù I told him straight up why didn‚Äôt you tell me? His response was I didn‚Äôt think I needed to. He showed me the text and I felt very uncomfortable because in the text she was talking about how we knew each other, she congratulated him on the new relationship, and she started reminiscing about memories she had with him. In following text she said I see we‚Äôve gotten to the point of unfollowing each other, okay I get it! Best of luck! I felt like she was trying to stay relevant but my bf didn‚Äôt see that. I just brushed it off and figured maybe I‚Äôm just over reacting but I still told him that he broke my trust and if she comes up again and you don‚Äôt tell me, don‚Äôt count on me sticking around.

A week later she messaged him again but this time he told me. She messaged him out of the blue it was something  along the lines of how she needed space from him (they hadn‚Äôt seen each other in months or even talked, she only started messaging because I came into the picture) and that if we ever saw her at a concert(we are big edm concert goers) that he can‚Äôt approach her and her friends, she was jealous of me and she was going to unfollow me out of respect and that she was still going to watch his Instagram story to see his dog and not to be ‚Äúweirded out‚Äù by it because she just misses his dog. I told him he needed to block her on everything because I genuinely just did not feel comfortable with her trying to get back into his life. After talking to him he finally did and now two months later things are great but I still have trust issues with him.

How can I work on regaining my trust with him? I already have trust issues to begin with from my past but I can‚Äôt seem to wonder if he‚Äôs secretly talking to someone even though he really doesn‚Äôt give me a reason not to trust him. I‚Äôm also wondering if this could be a me problem and if so what are some things that I could do to try to strengthen our relationship.

t3_dliswh,"I [M17] am pretty sure that my friend [F18] likes me, but i'm too much of a coward to ask if she want's to date"," 

We've known each other since the beginning of the new school year, and have basically spent every waking hour of the day together ever since. I've never met a person who i can relate to as much as her, in my entire life. I'm terrible at small talk, but when i'm with her, it's like i never run out of things to say, and neither does she. We spend the breaks together, we eat together, we work together, and we take the bus together. If we're both at school, then we're definetly together. We also constantly text each other on snapchat for hours on end.

A couple of weeks ago she invited me to the movies, since her boyfriend couldn't come (from what she tells me, they broke up the day after, because he was a verbally abusive drug dealing stoner) and we had a great ol' time. I later invited her to have a cup of coffee with me, where we walked across town talking and having fun. We were together for about 2 and a half hours, and i was planning on asking her if she wanted to date, but the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. I had the feeling that she probably was into me, because she was talking about how she missed being in a relationship, and right after asked me if i've ever had a girlfriend. She has also previoulsy described what kind of guys she's into, and it sounds a lot like me (Tired/sleepy looking, pale and monotone). The next day, i asked her if she wanted to hangout during the weekend, since neither of us had any plans. She said yes, and we hung out for about 6 and a half hours. We were just walking around talking, we walked into a restaraunt at one point and drank a glass of wine, and after that we just talked till it got dark. It was cold as fuck outside, and she forgot her scarf, and was just wearing leggings and a dress, but never asked to call it a day. We got really deep with each other, and talked about the worst aspects of our mental illnesses. I told her that i constantly have this voice in the back of my head, that tells me that people don't like me as much as they seem to. And that i've only misinterpreted their signals, and that they in reality don't like me all that much. And i think that that's one of the reasons that i'm nervous about asking her out. Because i have this fucking voice in my head, that shrouds my critical thinking and makes me believe that she, and everyone else don't like me. Which is why i'm posting here, because i need people to tell me. Anyway, i called myself an idiot for thinking that way, and she said that i wasn't, she said ""I think you're an intelligent, funny, well put together guy"" or something along those lines, and that's probably the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me...

I wanted to ask her right then and there so fucking badly, but i just couldn't. It seemed like she was waiting for me to ask, the entire day, but i was too scared to ruin our friendship if she really just does like me platonically. We've been talking about watching ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" (a great romantic comedy that i love) together for a few weeks now, and i was thinking of asking her there, but i'm affraid that i'll puss out again. I've also been thinking about just asking during break at school, but i really don't know.

t3_dllznt,My (25M) Gf (24F) was sending flirty/relationship type messages with a guy she knew while not telling me. (West Coast USA),"So a couple weeks ago I was hanging out with my girlfriend at my place (she lives with her Dad), and were watching TV when I noticed her phone kept getting notifications. She texts people, that's normal. She would reply very quickly and kinda hold her phone back so I couldn't see it. One of these times, she was messaging him she put her phone down without turning the screen off quickly, and I saw a guy's names she was texting ""Matt"". I tend to have an eagle eye for details, so I saw Matt's name, and some messages, which had the words ""Baby"", some Gifs with Hearts, and a message that said something along the lines of ""I wish we met earlier"" as well as some times he asking her if she wanted to hang out, but she would blow him off saying she was busy. At some point she goes to the kitchen to make some food for me and her so I quickly open her phone, Heart beating furiously and see that her and Matt have been flirting for awhile. Nothing that's cheating per ce physically or nudes wise, but I guess you could call it emotionally? So, furious, I close the messages and put down her phone. She comes back with the food, and I act like I didnt have any idea what was happening. I needed time to think. A day goes by and I think, and that evening I ask her if she wants to hang out and she says sure. She comes over to my place and I ask her what the hell she's been doing with Matt? She says he's just a friend (I've met him once) and she was just being nice and flirting with him for fun. I ask her if shes cheated with him, she said no, asked if she sent nudes, she said no. She just was having abit of fun. I love my GF to bits, I understood, and we hung out for the rest of the night, and she said that he meant nothing to her, That I'm her one and only BF, every other guy sucks. So after that night I asked her if we could take a break from seeing each other and talking for a few days, still needed time to process, and understand completely what was going on. Eventually we made up, and are doing okay now. She stopped flirting with him, he stopped flirting back, they still talk sometimes because Matt and her are friends, he seems like an ok guy, but both of them knew she was in a relationship. The advice I need here, is how do I 100% trust her again? I love her so so much, and will do anything for her, and she will do the same for me, but Jennifer is the love of my life and I want to trust her, but my mind keeps circling back to those conversations she had.

t3_dllz2u,I (21f) can't get over a problem with my bf (23m),"Tl;dr at the bottom

My bf and I have been together for 2.5 years and for a year everything was simply perfect. But a little after our 1 year anniversary, I started noticing his strange behavior.

He'd hide his gallery and act panicky when I want to see our pictures and he'd tell me it's because he's making a surprise gift for me but.. I'd never get one.. One time while he was showing me something on his phone, a small picture of a half naked girl popped up from his 'recent screenshots', he just ignored it and I made up an excuse for him in my head. Another time he asked me to reply to a text on his phone and when I went to his texts I saw he texted his new number to his ex girlfriend (with whom he'd been in a relationship for 3.5 years). So I became really suspicious..

I felt awful. After a week of thinking about what to do, I decided to do a terrible thing and go through his phone. I felt really guilty until I went to his gallery and into hidden albums... There was an album with 300+ pictures of half naked girls from his instagram, his so called friends... His friends from school, his neighborhood, his friends ' friends etc. It hurt like hell but I hid the album again, left the phone and pretended everything was great. I needed to think. I needed to be alone. And the thinking I did.

I have anxiety so I had to rehearse every possible conversation we could have. But I had to say something. That was my first heartbreak.. I've never cried as much as in those 7 days..

After a night-long conversation, tears from both sides and his begging to stay together, I decided to give him another chance. He deleted the album and promised never to do anything like that before. He unfollowed most of those girs. But sometimes he still looks at their profiles.. 

But I can't stop thinking about that even after a year, I never expected he'd be able to do that. I'm afraid I'd get hurt again. I can't rebuild the trust, I don't know how.

   Tl;dr Bf acted weird, hiding his gallery from me, I snooped and found half naked girls pictures and even after a year, I can't get over it and I keep thinking he'll hurt me again.",relationship_advice

Pretty much i never really cared about women. I just keep doing things i like during my free time (video games), if i enjoy that it cant be a waste of time.

In Japan he could only stay so long without a visa if we aren't married. But if we get married he is allowed to be an dependent on my visa.

t3_dllwj8,Am I overthinking this chlamydia thing?,"Hey all. So I was a 24M virgin and my current gf is 21F. Earlier this month she was diagnosed with chlamydia, so I went and got checked and I was positive. We both got our antibiotics and waiting to get tested again later this month. However Im starting to have thoughts in the back of my mind about how this all started.

So my only sexual contact was receiving oral when I was like 16-17, and again last New Years time frame. I asked the New Years girl if she had it she said no she always gets tested and never had an STD/STI. Then comes current gf. We started dating mid August. Unprotected sex was soon after (stupid, I know). 

She says she never had an STD/STI. So never any symptoms, never had burning piss like she was experiencing. Before me she said the last time she had sex was over a year ago when she was in a ~4 year relationship. 

So what is concerning me is she‚Äôs going to be moving out of the family house soon. She has an apartment in mind with a male coworker. She goes and checks out the apartment layout and gets measurements to make sure her furniture can fit through everything. She was there for about 3-4 hours I think. That was about 28 Sept. I picked her up, she introduced me to him. Then we left and I think we had sex that day or maybe the next, idk can‚Äôt really remember. Skip a few days later it looks like her first symptoms of Chlamydia happened about 3 Oct (from what it seems like in text anyways.) First I thought it was a UTI because I was a virgin and all. She gets tested for that, nah. Gets tested for STD/STI and chlamydia. She called me afterwards crying because she was scared and stuff. I did ask if she was with some other guy she quickly said ‚Äúwhat no what the fuck‚Äù. And never mentioned that question again.

So i comfort her about things will get better. All it takes is antibiotics and it‚Äôll go away. Her symptoms are gone now. Like I said we‚Äôre both getting tested later to make sure it‚Äôs gone. 

Idk how it came to mind but today I looked back at the text to see if the apartment tour and first symptoms were nearby. And like I mentioned they were only 6 days apart. Am I thinking too much about this? I know chlamydia can hide for a long ass time before symptoms appear, but I just find it funny that she never experienced anything before the apartment tour. Do you guys recommend even bringing this up in question? I feel like it‚Äôs going to just be ‚Äúwhat no you don‚Äôt trust me‚Äù and stuff. So pretty much she‚Äôs gunna say no even if something went down. What do y‚Äôall suggest?",relationship_advice

t3_dlili3,32 (f) recently started seeing a 53 (m). Seeking advice from others in relationships with an age difference.,"Hi all,

Brief background information: I've always been very good in career and business, but not so much in relationships. Married my high school drug dependent sweetheart thinking I'd be able to change him,  realised I couldn't and I've been divorced since 2017.

Now moving on to present day. For the past two years I have known this very wonderful man. I know him through work acquaintances and he has always been very kind and supportive of me. Earlier this year I noticed the way he looked at me and organically a great friendship was created which has turned into an incredible relationship.

We talk about everything and nothing is secret. I have never felt this way before, where it just feels right. I have dated other people along with my ex and it didn't feel right but with his man. It is just absolute bliss. He treats me in ways I never thought I'd be treated, he lets me be me and although we both know there is 20 years between us, it never feels like that when we are together. We just click.

The problem is he is separated not divorced (was separated before we got together), his 18 year old daughter and 16 year old son know about me, although I am yet to meet them.

I feel for his soon to be ex wife, because it is such a typical cliche. Kids get older, marriage falls apart and man ends up with younger woman. I do not my happiness to cause pain for someone else.

I've been through the devastation that comes from a break up and so I'm apprehensive about what the future holds. But at the same time, the feelings we have cannot be ignored. We were both taken by surprise by how quickly everything fell into place and how the relationship progessed so easily.

For the first time in my life, I have found a relationship that fulfils me on all levels. We love the same things, we are both passionate about life and it is comfortable without being boring. 

 I don't want to give it up, but I also want to be rational with my thinking.

Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation, did it work out? Why/why not?

t3_dlil0i,Is my bf controlling? Or just overly curious?,"Basically my bf always seems extremely observant/nosy/curious.

When I am the kitchen cooking he is sometimes right on top of me watching what I am doing and asking questions and will stir stuff if I move away from it for a second.

A lot of times if he is in his room and I am in the kitchen cooking he will ask what I am doing or what I am making/eating every time I go out there. It is not just him saying ""what are you doing"" or ""where are you"" because he does not know where I went, he wants to know more.

The other day my Mom gave me my cleats and soccer ball after we had dinner, because I forgot them at home so I could play with my friends. I got them from her and when I went back into his car he goes ""you didn't tell me you were playing soccer.""

I am thinking as I am typing this that its his need to always know whats going on. Like he will do that a lot, like if I went to lunch at Chick Fil A or something on campus and I mention it he will say ""you didn't tell me you went.""

I guess what mostly makes it weird is the wording. He does not say ""Oh, I did not not know you guys were playing soccer"" more like ""I wish you told met that.""",relationship_advice

Fast forward to two weeks back, she came back home and from the very beginning something was off. She always seemed sad and lifeless, even the way she looked at me was different from when she left. I asked her what's the matter, but she brushed it off, saying it was all fine. One day when she went to take a shower, she forgot to get her phone to the bathroom with her, and to my surprise it was unlocked. She was talking to her best friend about how weird it feels to be with me and how guilty she feels. My world collapsed, at first I thought she cheated on me. I left the phone and went outside to have a smoke, and when i came back I started crying, but I didn't want to tell her what I just saw. I told her that I feel like she hides something from me, she denied and told me she loves me. For another couple days I kept to myself what I just saw, but then I finally snapped and told her. She started crying, and explained everything to me about how he was such a relief for her during that 5 months and how she nearly came to love me, but she assured me that nothing has been physical. It's been almost a week since that talk and I still can't wrap my head around this. I feel so awkward around her, like I'm being second placed to that guy. They still talk from time to time and it boggles me so hard but putting an end to their friendship would just hurt our relationship even more. I don't think I can't trust her, and even though she tells me she loves me, I just don't feel like she actually does. I feel like absolute garbage, but I'm tired of this discussion.

t3_dllpxz,How to forget,"I was in kind of a long - distance relationship with this girl for about 8 months and it turns out she wasn't so serious about us since she broke up with me because of a mild argument and me not accepting that she was hiding some things from me that she shouldn't be hiding if she wants to be honest with me. She said that I'm not letting her be free and blocked me on all her social media accounts (we live far away from each other so driving there isn't an option).

My fianc√© is out of town for two days for work. I was looking at the photos on our iPad from our last trip and was deleting some. I went to empty the trash but there was a photo that must've synced from iCloud. I'm not going to get into details but it was of the private bits of a woman...I am in shock and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

His buddy's send him racy photos all the time of naked women from online but they're usually doing weird things. My only concern is that I don't want to break up over something one of his buddy's sent him. Is there a way to see if a photo was taken with the camera or if it was downloaded? I don't want to break up our life if it was just from a friend. I know if I confront him he will deny it was him so I need to be prepared. I also need to know what I am dealing with before I walk down the aisle. My fianc√© and I have great communication and I always assumed he was telling the truth but now I don't know how to tell and am beginning to question everything.

I am a 19F ,who is a lead singer of a band in town. Recently ( as in 2-3 months ago recently),I met this guy 23M, who is the lead singer of another band in our town. We met through the bass player who plays for the both of us. We go to each other‚Äôs gigs, promote each other‚Äôs stuff and understand our crazy schedules as musicians.
I enjoy spending time with this guy and he enjoys spending time with me. It feels really natural and he is overall a great guy who has his shit together.
I am just conflicted about him and us since there is one tiny problem. I am more well established in the music scene in our town than he is. I have been doing it for 5 years and he has been doing it for a year and a half. He has talked about wanting to do duets and recording some music together. I am just conflicted and second guessing everything since I don‚Äôt know if he is after me or what I could do to boost his band.

t3_dlfv0r,I (20F) don‚Äôt know what to do about a crush,"It‚Äôs a long story so just bare with me.

About a month ago I broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of almost 4 years. It was a dead relationship for a long time, and looking back I should‚Äôve broken up after 6 months-a year, I lost feelings quite quickly. 

Regardless, I started developing a crush on a guy (19M) in my friend group probably around a year and a half ago. It became much stronger recently and I told him on Thursday and he didn‚Äôt give me an answer as to whether he liked me or not. I told him I wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship because I‚Äôd only recently broken up with my boyfriend. I was fine, I was coping, then this weekend happened. 

I should probably mention at this point that we‚Äôre an online friend group. We meet up with most of us (there‚Äôs 20+ in the group) twice a year and then some of us meet up in smaller groups too. 

Anyway, this weekend a few of us met up, myself and my crush included. Ever since he arrived until the moment he left my heart rate was high, something I‚Äôve never had with a person before. It went down every so often, but generally it was high and I was shaking so bad. 

I‚Äôm talking to some mutual friends about it all the next day and getting mixed messages. One thinks it‚Äôs a rebound and I shouldn‚Äôt do anything, another thinks going on a date wouldn‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôm lost.

I then find out he only started liking me at the weekend, and that he‚Äôd never thought about me in that way before now. He also respects me wanting to stay single for a while (but again, I feel like the weekend changed my perspective on it all).

Help I just, I don‚Äôt know what to do! I really just don‚Äôt want to get hurt or hurt him.

I like her a lot, and am quite attracted to both her appearance and personality.  Up until we met I had never had sex before.   I had spent the previous 8-9 years of my life only orgasming from masturbation.  I‚Äôve found our sex life very enjoyable but for some reason I am unable to cum from it.  At first I had trouble getting erect (we tried 3 times before i finally could), and still sometimes struggle with it.  I know there is nothing physically wrong with me because I have no problems finishing on my own.  The sex feels pretty good, but just not enough to make me finish.  On a few occasions I was relatively close, but often not so much.  In addition, blowjobs offer very little sensational pleasure to me.

t3_dlfu3y,"I (25m) am questioning my relationship (25f) for the last years, is it ok to ask for a pause?","Hey all,

short backstory ahead:

Me and my SO are soon hitting an 8 year relationship - we basically spent our whole youth with each other and moved in together about 4 years ago. For me, it was the first real relationship, she came out of a kind of abusive relationship (as in, ignoring her needs and feelings, forcing her into stuff she wasn't willing to do, etc).

For the better part of our relationship, I mostly put my needs second because I feared of loosing her. Over the course of the last years, I learned that this is definitely not the way to handle things. I realized that communicating your needs is very important and that my SO won't run away when we have different opinions.

About 3 years ago, I started to notice that the relationship was not as fulfilling anymore, but I mainly related that to both of us having full schedules (me working, her finishing her first graduation). So we sat down and promised us to do something else with our free time together, like going out for dinner, doing sport together, go for a walk, etc.

This worked for some time, until one year ago where we had another talk with the same result.

In the meantime, I seem to always question if the relationship is fine the way it is, or if I am only  together with her for the fear of not finding someone as ""good"" of a person as her. When we talk about our future, she always seems so confident that we are a perfect match - marriage, then some kids, buying a house, etc. - but I am simply not on the same page. If I'd propose, she would instantly say yes - on the other way around, I would say no. I feel like she is a wonderful person and would be a great mother - but romantically, we are unable to make it work (at least for me, she is fine the way it is). I simply don't feel as attracted to her as before. Honestly, it feels more like we are more made to be (best) friends than married.

The latest point that comes to my mind is me having the opportunity to move to another city for a limited time next year to pursue my career - I thought about it being an opportunity to find out what I want and only staying like 2-3 days at home with her, and her telling me she would definitely move with me and start up new in that city.

tl;dr: Is permanently questioning your relationship at this stage (8 years, everybody around us marrying) normal? Is a break from the relationship a good idea, and if so - will it even bring me some clarity about what I want in life and our relationship?",relationship_advice
t3_dlfsjb,My (m29) gf (f26) has started geyting back in touch with an ex fwb and i feel terrible,"We've been together for five years, have a house together and two weeks before this we found out we're pregnant 

One day she told me she had gotten back in touch h with an old friend, and she stressed the fact they were friends and nothing more, from high school, I was happy for her and thought it was excellent. 
In the following days her behaviour changed slightly and she didn't really mention him that much, I did the horrible thing and looked through her messages (I know). Their texts were mentioning that she hadn't told me that they had been friends with benefits, and they were talking about meeting. 
One day when I'm at work she messages me and asks what I would say if we were to meet that same evening - I of course said yes, thinking I were part of those plans - but no matter what I said she found excuses to do it alone. 
She got home about an hour later than agreed upon and I felt fucking terrible waiting for her
When she got home I voiced my concern about the fact I could feel I wasn't welcome and she said that she had some things she had to talk to him about - without me.
My heart sank, and I told her that it didn't matter I just wanted her to be truthful. 

She wasn't 

I did the unthinkable again and read their correspondence, she had sent him screenshots of our conversation with me finding excuses and worst of all they were talking about how difficult it had been saying goodbye. Also they were talking about what could have been with them and Saint Junipero (if anyone have seen black mirror you know how devastating that was for me) 


They have been in contact daily since, she doesn't talk about it and I sometimes loose sleep over this. They even have talked about meeting when I'm at work - she didn't say no even though she knew how I felt about it 

I even have a feeling she might have been sending him snaps of a kind only I should get because he wrote to her he was ""sorry he didn't screenshot itüòè""



How should I tackle this? I love her to pieces and couldn't imagine a life without her and I am willing to do whatever it takes to get over this. I don't necessarily think I want her to stop talking to her because she can decide for herself, but obviously that would be",relationship_advice

t3_dlldlk,I (24f) came out to my bf(25m)of 7 years last night at dinner?,"I don't really know what to think at this point, do I let it go and move on or do I need to say something...?

Backstory: Bf and I have been together for around 7 damn years. Before I was with him I was in a relationship with a female for about a year. I was young, 15; she was much older 18 but it was more than just a little kid relationship. Obv at that age I was head over heels in love with her, and completely heartbroken when we broke up. In the next two years after that I met my current bf, who knew of my past because we had mutual friends. Small town most people did. We would see her out and stuff and he would make little slick comments here and there about myself with a female, his friends around us would make jokes about it too..... so this whole time...‚Ä¶ I figured he knew I was into females....? right ??? or no.. ?

Anyways, here's what happened. We were at dinner last night; I was talking to him about a conversation that I had with my younger cousin the previous weekend. My cousin asked what my sexuality is and causally as I was telling my boyfriend I was just like oh idk I like who I like and continued telling bf the rest of the conversation. My boyfriend realized what I said and back tracked it with "" so youd eat pussy again?"" shocked at the least I was like huh? what ? and he said it again. I was shocked and confused enough to where I couldn't answer and finally I was like..... did you.... forget who my ex was?? Which led him to finally say oh I thought it was a phase which kinda pissed me off lol but anyways I straight up asked him if he was upset, and he was like yeah I‚Äôm a little pissed I didn't know. He asked if I was still attracted to females, and asked if I would ever be with a female again, and he asked the pussy question again( I hate that word). I was like idk bf I like who I like but I haven‚Äôt had an attraction to anyone since being with you. He made a face. Finally I said ‚Äú BF, I haven‚Äôt thought about being with anyone male or female since being with you, because I‚Äôm committed to you, and want a life with YOU‚Äù eventually we continued to finish talking about my cousin and stuff, and he didn‚Äôt bring it up again. But now im sitting at working constantly thinking about how he was genuinely upset which I guess I kind of understand but I think if he gets mad enough in the future and we fight he‚Äôs 100% going to bring it up. I don‚Äôt know what or if I should say anything to him about it or just leave it alone‚Ä¶ what do you guys think?",relationship_advice
t3_dli8j4,Im (f20) in love with my best friend/unofficial boyfriend (m20) but he said he has feelings for another girl too...,"At the start of the year, we entered into a fwb situation but this eventually grew as we found ourselves basically dating without the label (holding hands, making out, going out together everywhere, saying we love each other, etc). That whole time I liked him but I thought that although he cared for me, he wouldnt want to be in an actual relationship with me so i was okay with continuing as is, secretly hoping that he would eventually want to be in a relationship with me over time. I felt more hopeful of this around Jul when a mutual friend lied to him that he (mutual friend) had hooked up w me (In reality, we didnt; the mutual friend (not a friend anymore) came on v strong and made me uncomfortable, i left and that was that.)
But my best friend was very upset at the thought of me with someone else and after i cleared it out with him, he made it explicit that he wanted it to be exclusive between us.

In August, we moved in together simply because we had been wanting to move out for a long time, for separate reasons. Also, we have wanted to move out and planned this even before we became fwb. 

The feelings that I have for him grew stronger over the last three months living together because we were practically dating without the label (even he says this). So i brought up the I‚Äôm conversation of ‚Äúis this going anywhere‚Äù a few times and it left him feeling quite frustrated each time. I tried to move on because rationally, i can see that if someone doesnt want to commit, they clearly dont feel interested in that way but because we were still being intimate even after these conversations and acting like we were dating, i couldnt let go of how i felt and try to move on.

About two weeks ago though, he told me in passing that he has started to develop feelings for a girl at work so i immediately assumed that that meant we were over and I had no chance. But after one silent/awkward day, we continued to kiss/sleep together/hold hands and stay intimate. 
Because i was so confused about our situation, i just decided to tell him the truth that I have feelings for him and he was empathetic and a good friend. I assumed that now that he knew how i felt about him, he wouldn‚Äôt continue to act the way that we were acting as he doesnt feel the same way toward me, he likes someone else.

But we keep doing it and a part of me knows i should stop it but i go along with it because i keep hoping that it means he wants to be with me too.

Tonight, i was honestly so confused and upset that i said to him that because i like him and he doesnt feel the same way toward me, its not a good idea for us to keep hooking up and being intimate. But he was hurt that I wanted to stop this and said that he likes me and he likes the other girl. 

The way i see it though, if he doesnt want a relationship with me the way that I do, i think i need to start moving on and I cant do that when we keep being so intimate. But he had a hard time understanding this...

I‚Äôm having trouble understanding his perspective and I really need some advice about how to move forward with this. I really want to be with him but not if he likes someone else too and I keep feeling empty and used after we keep acting so intimate.",relationship_advice

t3_dllan4,My [27f] partner [26m] doesn't appreciate me and I feel crappy.,"My bf works as a pizza delivery driver and due to various circumstances we need to move out asap. We decided upon buying a house, now I dont work as I look after our son all the time.

I have money from an accident which he wanted me to use, somehow I have to provide 50% of the deposit but im not allowed to get a job. He says im not in a position to.

Now because of him being on minimum wage he cant get a mortgage with me and my son on it. So hes single. To get my 13000 he had to have it gifted from other people and say it was from them, and they dont want it back and I have to pay them back. He hasnt once said thank you for this and says im only doing myself a favour despite me legally signing away my entitlement to that money and that house. 

However the people that gifted it to him like as a proxy for me hes constantly saying they've done him the ""favour of a lifetime"" and other stuff. And only him, he wont thank them from me as he says what if the mortgage people find out he said it??? 

Even today he was depositing a cheque and made a point of saying to the cashier it was going to pay for his new house, and comes back to me and says the same. Its like why bring it up.

He said he would work less if I gave this money but I also discovered he has agreed to work this weeks holiday that he had booked off, he didnt even talk to me about it. Its like he gets that freedom but default I have to ask permission to do owt because of the baby and its really frustrating. Especially when his time equals my time cause I cant do a thing while hes working.

He doesn't think he should do anything with the baby ""because he works"" but if I try to explain thats only the deal if the man provides and I actually contribute a fair amount financially he just argues and shuts down.

He says he will pay for everything once we are in the new house but is also telling me im not allowed to spend any of my money atm, which I find it impossible to believe he doesnt intend on using it once we are there if Im not allowed to use it now.

He acts as if having the baby is a punishment or a favour when really its just the standard. He also demands a lot of my time while hes working, always wanting to text or call and asks me to do things for him. He says these don't count because he is able to do it by himself so they somehow dont count as things I do for him.. (??)

As soon as he comes home he has to watch what he wants on tv cause ""i get all the time in the world to do it"" between the baby and his phone calls I actually dont. I got annoyed with him last night as he was on world of warcraft and asked me for the remote and said I give him such a hard time. 

Hes always on warcraft though, if hes at home hes online. I just feel crappy about it. He doesnt give me any credit whatsoever and I find myself not even wanting to talk to him cause it just is a drain on me that hes gonna turn around and say never happened.",relationship_advice

t3_dlla4k,Polyamory??,"So, my girlfriend(20F) and I(21M) have been together for 2 1/2 years and have hit a crossroads.

I should start with a little backstory.  For a little over a year we havent had sex (which is another story in and of it self) because she has had some sexual trauma surfacing from her childhood, and it has been causing some serious PTSD.  That being said, she recently proposed the idea of polyamory, and how she would be comfortable if i dated another girl, so there wasnt so much ""pressure to please you"". 

So we had a discussion about how things would work out and we have very different ideas..

I for one dont really even want to go sleep around.  I mean, sure it sounds like a sweet deal, I get to go bang randoms and it be totally okay, sure.  But she wants this to be a mutal thing. (Clearly by the definition of polyamory)  She wants to start another relationship with someone else alongside ours, when our relationship is probably at its darkest its ever been.  I should note that she is bisexual and says she like both men and women equally.  And I told her that I dont feel comfortable with her dating another man. You can call me sexist but im just not intimidated by another woman entering our relationship the same way I am a male.

She says she ""probably wont even date a guy anyway, so dont worry"".  To which my response was, ""well if its not a guy i really don't have a problem"".
But then she got mad and said ""I'm not making that promise"".  Which in my opinion, literally implies that she fully intends on dating a dude.  Maybe I'm wrong/looking too far into it, but like no. Not about it.  This whole thing wasn't even my idea and im trying to meet in the middle here.

Idk.. i just feel like she just wants to be with somebody else and doesn't have the balls to leave.

She actually said ""I think having another man would teach me how to love you more."".

Wtf? Maybe im crazy but that makes no sense to me at all.  And frankly, I was kind of insulted.

Like I said, I get she wants me to blow off steam, but I don't really care about having sex with other girls as much as I want her to be happy and healthy and have our own sex life back.  I dont think this is the healthiest thing to add to an already possibly failing relationship.  Its more likely gonna drive us apart even further.

Am I being irrational with my ""no males"" request?",relationship_advice
t3_dll9mw,Should I(22f) trust that my bf(23m) is trying to be better and is learning?,"My bf was never in a relationship before we got together. We have been dating for a year and this is my first SERIOUS relationship, so as you know you live, grow and learn together. I am a much more aware person socially than he is and I have also dated/flirted with people and have more experience in that respect.

I learned quickly that my bf was not the best socially(not autistic) in the sense that he just for some reason is not in touch with how you should act with people(such as saying certain things)? He has done some things that have hurt me, and that a lot of people would probably call him an asshole for, but a lot of it was unintentional, or his just plain stupidity of not knowing.

He, just like many other people deserve to be told that they are doing something wrong, so they can redeem themselves/make things right. If you just dump someone the second they do something that upsets you, I believe that is wrong. I will give some examples.

1. I was not ready to have sex when he was and he was kind of an asshole about it in the beginning, but ended up then apologizing for his behavior. This issue is kind of over, considering I love sex now and it is pointless to dwell on it since he also said sorry.(Happened a while ago)
2. He has said some hurtful things to me, that just don't seem hurtful in his eyes. Ex: telling me that someone on tv was in better shape than me, just because I had commented about how they were a ""big guy."" It was a linebacker. He knew it was wrong of him to say, he ended up apologizing but the fact he even did this in the first place, is beyond me.

Before I continue, I want to say that I understand this is probably his lack of social intelligence/just stupidity in general.

3.  I explained how my friend played soccer as well and he goes ""i bet she is better than you."" I just don't get the point of saying something like this? He has a competitive  nature, so my best guess is maybe it comes from this and he needs to be right/thinks he is funny.

   4. I told him strip clubs are not my thing in a relationship and he told me that I would need to just get over it if he wants to go. He also told me that he would just not tell me about it if it came down to that. This really pissed me off and had me questioning if I wanted to associate with such an asshole. (Happened a while ago)

Now the strip club thing I think has changed a lot since then. I avoided the conversation about them with him, because I did NOT want to revisit that and fight about it. However, since then, if the topic ever comes up around us I am silent and he does not really say much. I think he has probably done research on the internet about it or something, just because he seems to have an attitude change on it. Next time it is relevant, I will try and discuss it.

He did text me something joking about how he was going to one and I said ""if people want to do that cool, its just not my thing."" He wrote back ""chill I am jk"" which both 1) pissed me off bc he brought it up yet he told ME to chill and 2) made me assume he probably said he was jk so I knew he would not do it.

One thing I did find insensitive about the whole thing was that we once were talking about bachelor parties through text and he wrote ""we all know where I am going for mine."" I found it hurtful of him to even make a joke out of it, after he knew it hurt me. Now the issue is, I don't even know if he was kidding. I think he was, but to make a joke about it was still hurtful because he knew how I felt about it.

Before anyone says anything. I understand that strip clubs are a divided issue. It is totally okay for couples to go to them, if they agree that it is okay. In this case, I personally do not like them.

I think he has grown as a person and has done a lot to try and be more respectful of my boundaries, which is why I am trying to be more understanding of him and have patience with him growing.

We did actually break up a few weeks ago(for a few hours), BECAUSE of a lot of issues. The main issues were him being kind of an ass and saying disrespectful things to me. What put the icing on the cake, was when he was drunk at a work event of his and he told me that I didn't know shit about what I was talking about, when he was drunk. His friend was discussing a lady they work with and I said something about it and he goes ""you don't know shit about x.""

He wanted me back and did not want to end it.

This had me furious and done, because in my head, he was not changing or getting any better about anything. This showed me that he had no respect for me. He had said rude things to me before when he was drinking and it was the final straw for me and I felt that instead of me asking for change, I needed to just end it because it was too much for me to ask of him.

It was not just this, but he had tried to argue with me and tell me that it is how he is and that drinking probably just brings it out in him more. I was trying to reason with him and he was not, so I felt that I had to end it.

Lately I have been happy being back in the relationship and glad to have him back. He told me that if he does something to hurt me he wants to change it and wants me to tell him what I do, so he can fix it. He is putting in a strong effort to be better and besides all of these issues, he is loving and is a good boyfriend.

My issue is that I feel that if I point out things that are wrong, it seems like I am trying to change him and shape him into someone he isn't, but he HAS acknowledged that he is sort of an asshole and needs to be better. The reason I broke up with him int he first place is because I felt that I don't have the right to try and ask someone to change, but he tells me he wants to be better and wants to change these issues for me.

My question is, should I just trust him for these next few months and see if I notice progress in him? I don't think giving him a chance is wrong, considering I deeply love him and want to have hope. I was the one who tried to end it so that I could stop trying to get him to be someone he is not, but he wants to be better and tells me he does not want it to end, so I don't think I am doing wrong?

TL;DR: My bf has been an asshole in our relationship, but wants to do better. Should I accept and trust that he is going to be better, instead of doubting it? So far he has done better.",relationship_advice
t3_dll8i0,How do I tell the guy I‚Äôm seeing to get rid of the photos of his ex on his social media? Help?,"19 year old female here, dating a 23 year old male. We recently started a relationship. I feel extremely lucky to have met him and we have discussed how we are both wanting and looking to have a serious long term relationship. 

The one thing that bothers me however, is the fact that he still has photos of his ex on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Half of his Instagram feed is of his ex and how much he love(d) her. They broke up almost a year ago after she cheated on him. I asked him last week if he was over his ex and he told me that some part of him will always love her, that their relationship is over and he is looking to love and fall for someone else. He and his ex dated for 4 years all throughout when they where in college and they met in high school. She was his first love. Not to mention that he still follows her on all social media. 

I‚Äôm not jealous or insecure about their relationship, it‚Äôs just odd and a red flag to me that you would still have contact with an ex after a breakup, more so after they have cheated on you. I also figure that if you where really over your ex you would remove and delete the photos especially once you start seeing someone new. How should I tell him that it‚Äôs pretty much a deal breaker if he is still involved with his ex and doesn‚Äôt remove her completely from social media ? 

I just don‚Äôt want to start a serious relationship when an ex is obviously still in the picture.",relationship_advice
t3_dlelkr,Should I (F24) tell my boyfriend (M27) that I had a FWB who lives on the same street as him?,"My boyfriend and I met on tinder. Before we decided to exclusively date each other, I had a sexual relationship with 2 guys. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. A couple months ago, he bought a house where one of the guys I had a sexual relationship with lives. This guy and I never connected with each other, all we did was have sex then I would leave. This only happened for 2-5 weeks, I stopped talking to him a couple of weeks before my boyfriend and I became exclusive. I‚Äôm just hoping I don‚Äôt encounter this guy and honestly, this thought doesn‚Äôt happen all the time because to me, it‚Äôs not really important. However, my boyfriend had a previous relationship where he was cheated on. He also just gave me a key to his house 2 weeks ago. I feel like I need to tell him this because I don‚Äôt want him to find out not from me and also because I love and respect him. I just know it will be uncomfortable for him and I don‚Äôt want him to not trust me for not telling him earlier on. But at the same time, I want to come clean and not have anything to hide from him. Also, it feels like this information shouldn‚Äôt matter anymore as my sexual relationship with that guy died before we became exclusive. Any thoughts?

t3_dll869,"After 5 years my ex contacted me last night, should I respond?","We dated in middle school, we are both 19, I'm almost 20. Some say middle school dating doesn't count, but we dated for two years, one of those years long distance since his family moved across country. He was very controlling and a bit emotionally abusive, especially after he moved. He wanted to know what I was doing constantly and often got pissed off I didn't respond soon enough. He also would say things like ""You're the only person I have. If you leave I have no one."" He knew how to guilt trip me and he did it often. After I completely cut ties he used new and random accounts online to try to talk to me until I completely shut him down. Over the past 5 years, I still think about him. He was my first and only serious relationship so far and had ruined so many things for me. I often wondered if he still though about me or if I was just some bump in the road. But last night, he made a new Facebook account and sent friend requests to my friends to try to get a hold of me. One of our old mutual friends accepted his request so he was able to send me a request and message me. It was just a Facebook message wave, but it's still got me wondering if I should message back. Maybe he is apologizing maybe he feels bad, but also he could be just as bad and just ruin my life again. I'm all about second chances, but I can't tell if he deserves one or not. Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated. I also appreciate you sticking out this long post. Idk if it follows the rules or not, but I had to get this out there some how.",relationship_advice
t3_dll7ke,Complicated situation between me (21M) and my friend (20NB),"Tl;dr: having trouble deciding whether it‚Äôs worth expressing my feelings to an ex that I dumped 2 years ago cause I was moving and wasn‚Äôt over my ex at the time. Feelings have definitely increased over time. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me what do? 

Before I say anything I just wanna say this is my first time posting or even really talking about my issues to the void so this is very new to me but I will try my best because I don‚Äôt know what to do. Also to those who don‚Äôt know (NB) is non binary. 


The beginning of 2017 was essentially the worst segment of my life. College wasn‚Äôt working out for me so I dropped out and I had no direction in my life. On my birthday my ex‚Äôs friend got into an accident near my house which ended up in her dumping me (there was other reasons as well) I had gotten fired from a job that I actually liked. I was moving so my band was breaking up which was the only thing keeping me from spiraling into major depression. Shit was BAD. And all this happened between January-February. 

By the time Spring was rolling around I met someone who is the person in question. We hit it off really quickly and really well to where we essentially started dating almost immediately. It was a strange relationship for me cause this person genuinely seemed to like me for me which unfortunately is something I felt I hadn‚Äôt felt from any of my past relationships. Even then this whole thing was hard cause we were both car-less at the time and we lived a good distance from each other but we‚Äôd see each other at every local show as that was a big part of my life then. Anyways a lot of my anxieties and insecurities surfaced really fast and I also was still trying to get over all the situations i was dealing with prior to this I was still very much in love with my previous partner as well which made things very complicated for myself. 

Eventually I decided this person was too good for me &amp; the bullshit I was dealing with they deserved better than someone who isn‚Äôt over their ex and moving. The decision hurt them a lot of course and I didn‚Äôt even give them the whole truth I don‚Äôt even remember what I said. I mostly definitely did not want to dump this person but i feel it was the best decision for the both of us. They seemed to be understanding though and we‚Äôve continued to be good friends. 

Fast forward two years and as y‚Äôall can see I still have strong feelings for this person but a lot has happened in two years. I don‚Äôt live in the same state as them anymore but I frequently visit though not them in particular. I plan on moving back next summer. Anyways I fluctuate from caring about the situation to not caring at all and it all depends on the amount of communication I have with said person. Over time this fluctuates as well. I use this as a coping mechanism cause if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd probably wouldn‚Äôt have sat here for the past two years fantasizing and constantly thinking about this person as I have recently. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Or even how to approach them about the situation again. the last time I had tried they said they were seeing someone and it was incredibly awkward for me prolly them as well. As of right now I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true anymore because they‚Äôve been talking to me more as of late (which they seem to not do when had been seeing someone) I have a tendency to over analyze and create false scenarios in my head but I‚Äôm trying to be as rational as possible. 

Anyone‚Äôs welcome to say anything even if you wanna be mean there is prolly some truth to what you‚Äôre saying. Thanks y‚Äôall.",relationship_advice
t3_dll66u,How do I (19F) approach my roommate (21F) not being courteous and generally being a subpar roommate?,"First off a bit of background--my parents own the house we live in so I essentially get choice of who I live with. Obviously I cannot kick her out at this very moment but in all likelihood if things don't change her lease simply would not be renewed.

I have multiple allegations against her so I'm awfully biased and probably not being the best roommate myself but I'm frustrated so hear me out, I've tried to leave most of the petty stuff out. 

1. We have three cats, two are mine one is hers, she CONSTANTLY forgets to feed her cat and clean his litter boxes(for weeks at a time). I've called her out on this multiple times and it's now at the point where I'll call it out when I see it. I'm not worried about the cat so much because he does have access to my cats food and litter boxes, more just annoyed at the basic lack of care she is providing to this animal, he deserves better. 

2. She rarely does the dishes, and she cooks all the time. When she does do the dishes it is only after there is zero space left in the sink and probably only because we ran out of spoons. I refuse to do them on the basis that I hand wash all my dishes immediately after use and don't feel like I should have to do hers as well. 

3. She won't mow the lawn? Lawn care is in both of our leases and I figured it would be split evenly between the two of us. Not the case apparently, I've mentioned it and she says she doesn't know how to use a lawnmower, I've offered to show her and she just never has the time. 

4. She's stopped going to classes(we have a class together) and is failing all of them, but all she does is complain about how she's failing all of them instead of actively going to class and studying. This relates to the roommate aspect because she stands in the doorway to my room and complains while I'm trying to study and generally disrupts my me time. I comment every time she doesn't go to class and she shrugs it off with the excuse that she's so far behind she needs to spend her time getting caught up before she goes to learn new material but she never gets caught up. 

5. She speaks(but more in the volume of a yell) to the cats, constantly. Her favorite spot to speak to them is directly outside of the bathroom which also happens to be directly outside of my room. This frequently happens at midnight or other similar times where it would be polite to be quiet. I've spoken to her about it and she mostly just gets annoyed that I'm 'policing her actions'. 

There are more things but these are the ones that seems to really irk me. 

What can I do/say to her to get her to understand that these things are becoming a major problem? I don't want to tell her to find a different place to live next year because she's in a hard spot financially and I know she really can't afford anywhere else but it's at the point where I don't want to live with her anymore.",relationship_advice

t3_dli25e,Are we actually working on things orrrrrrr??,"
This is gonna be a lengthy post...

Last year I (22/M) started dating a (21/F) around September or October. Everything started out really well, but we kinda both rushed into a relationship after we both ended getting out of a bad one around July. We had a great relationship until around April or May. We started fighting because she had taken offense to me saying ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to be your only source of happiness, i want you to have your own life and find things that make you happy outside of our relationship.‚Äù (I can admit it probably wasn‚Äôt the best thing to say, but i had PTSD from a previous relationship where i was the only thing my ex was focused on) 

When summer came around, she started working in nightlife, so i rarely saw her. Actually it got to the point where i only saw her if i offered to drive her to work. It was annoying because she wouldn‚Äôt text me or talk to me, but would post on Snapchat after work or whatever. This went on from like early June, to the end of July when i finally broke up with her for it because i felt like i wasn‚Äôt really in a relationship anymore. We got in a huge fight, and both said a lot of mean and hurtful things to each other, and then eventually i just blocked her. 

A little over a month goes by and i texted her after her birthday in September, we apologized to each other and forgave each other cause we realized we both played a role in us not working out. During our time apart i realized how much i really missed her and loved her, and felt as if the relationship wasn‚Äôt THAT bad. I just couldn‚Äôt necessarily deal with not talking to her or seeing her. This is someone i could 100% see myself marrying and having kids with, Ive never really felt or dealt with these kinds of emotions before. 

Now since we‚Äôve apologized we‚Äôve hung out a few times but the communication still isn‚Äôt really there and it sucks. We had agreed to work on things and take it slow, but i also feel like I‚Äôm still the only one putting in any effort whatsoever. I‚Äôll text her and reach out and she won‚Äôt respond, but will still post on social media, and look at/like my posts. Part of me is willing to wait for her and work on it, and the other part doesn‚Äôt wanna go through the heartache of dealing with this again. I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

TL;DR Me and my ex broke up, and started talking again after a month, but we still barely talk. Seems like old habits are coming back. Idk what‚Äôs going on",relationship_advice

t3_dll1es,I (30m) don‚Äôt feel very desired by my girlfriend (24),"I have been with my girlfriend for 6 months now, emotionally everything is great, we care about each other so much.  We spend most of the week together after work enjoying each other‚Äôs company and on the weekends we spend time doing our shared mutual interests. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is me over thinking or something real. The so called issue is I am not feeling desired physically and sexually. 

When we first started dating we were having sex frequently, not every time we spent together but it was a good balance, maybe 3 times a week average. She used to touch me (in a playful flirting way), sext me, tell me how much she wants me and be more playful. 

As of lately I am feeling a lack of all the above. In the last 3 months we have only have sex about 3 times a month. Usually right before or after her period. She doesn‚Äôt flirt with me anymore or tell me she wants me. I try to be to playful and try to initiate sex often but not to where it‚Äôs overwhelming for her but I am constantly shut down. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I value our relationship over any sexual desire that I may have, and I respect her and never become upset when she shuts me down. 

I really want to talk to her about my lack of feeling desired but I want to know the right away to approach it, or if my feeling is wrong and I need to re-evaluate my own thoughts due to some over thinking. 

Any advise would be appreciated.

I‚Äôm incredibly unhappy but don‚Äôt know any different and afraid this is the best it will be for me :(","I am terribly unhappy in my marriage, but too scared/sad to leave.  I come from a super religious background where women get married young, and divorce is frowned upon.  I broke away from that when I was a teenager, but the lack of familial support in my life has been incredibly difficult.  I met my husband when I was 22 and he was 46.  I bet you note the age difference - I do, too.  It‚Äôs always been too much for me, and too hard.  He has been cruel to me over the years and convinced me that I cannot do better in life.  Not what I wanted.  I spend a lot of my time feeling guilty for not making better choices when I was 22.  The only way I can explain it is that I was young, vulnerable, and desperate to be loved.  I came from nothing.  He seemed sophisticated and stable.  If you‚Äôve never been there, please try not to judge.  We‚Äôve been together 15 years and have two wonderful kids.  He‚Äôs a loving father.  People assume that we do well, financially, but we don‚Äôt.  I‚Äôve been able to make our life work on a shoestring budget - my husband is careless in business and I work side jobs in addition to being the primary caregiver for house and kids.  I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted and afraid to admit that, because everyone thinks we are the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù family.  I feel I owe my husband  something because he‚Äôs taken care of me financially, but it feels like prison.  Looking back, he kept me around by using fear and intimidation.  He now apologizes and admits it was wrong, and I believe he is sorry.  But I‚Äôm stuck now.  At this point I feel so invested in our life and family, that all of those years would be a waste.  We‚Äôve tried counseling, many years of it.  It‚Äôs been such a slog. 

I don‚Äôt share the bad parts of my marriage with anyone, and already feel guilty even sharing this anonymously.  Believe it or not, he is my best (only?) friend and I feel a duty to be loyal and take care of him.  The stress and sadness of this has damaged my health and I have almost felt suicidal.  I don‚Äôt know the solution.  My first therapist told me to divorce him, and paints my husband to be a terrible person.  Maybe that could be true, but it‚Äôs heartbreaking, because he‚Äôs the only man I‚Äôve loved in my lifetime. My second therapist chastised me for ‚Äúknowing what I was doing,‚Äù when I was 22, and told me to take responsibility for it.  I don‚Äôt know what that means... I‚Äôve been taking responsibility for all of my adult life and physically too exhausted anymore.  This therapist also told me she is surprised I‚Äôm not suicidal, which hurt.

I feel burned or not understood by therapists.  I‚Äôm losing hope that I‚Äôll ever feel happy again.  Please help.",relationship_advice
t3_dlgc5l,Why does she (38F) refused to be honest when the truth is obvious,"My ex broke up with me a few months ago out of the blue when i was at an NFL game with some guy friends (over the phone). Within a week she was holding hands and dating a guy she recently went on a mission trip with through our church who just went through a divorce 2 months prior. Two of her closest girl friends told me her out of the blue excuse of me not being a spiritual leader was a farce because her and this guy had been talking while we were dating as soon as they got home from this trip. I confronted her about this and a few other things she had told me before she had broken up and after were unraveling as lies (that she loved me and wanted to marry me, where she actually was, etc.).  She denied it and said i needed to let it go, move on and that she didn't know she liked him until immediatly after she ended things with me....uh huh...suuuuure. 2 months later he ended it and told her it was just sexual for him and she was nothing like his ex wife. She was devastated and that he was supposed to be her spiritual leader. 

I felt Karma had come back to get her and that helped me emotionally heal along with time to forgive her and move on. I occasionally have had to serve with this guy at church and one day he confessed to pursing her knowing we were dating at the time and while it was never physical until after it was over that they had talked, texted and gone out a couple of times while we were in a relationship. It was nice to get some closure and i told him while i forgave him i hope he learned not to do that again and how messed up and hurtful that was. Not too long after that i pulled her aside at church and told her i forgave her and that he fessed up for what they were doing and that I hope she finds a guy who treats her right again and that she learned not to do that to someone again and how hurtful that was knowing my ex wife had an affair a few years earlier. She denied everything and said he was making it all up and that she would never do such a thing and i'm ""utterly disgusting and despicable"" for accussing her of that and telling others that's what she was doing and it was all a bunch of lies and she can't trust me ever. 

That totally threw me off guard. We all lie in our lives, but i guess i just don't understand how when the evidence is obvious what happened that people just can't finally admit to what they did and accept responisiblity and say they are sorry. Can anyone shed light on why?",relationship_advice
t3_dlku37,How do I get my (27m) wife (27f) to appreciate me and my sacrifices?,"So this may be a little all over the place but bear with me I have a lot of thoughts going on right now. 

My (27m) wife (27f) and I have been together for 13 years since we were 14. I love her to death and despite some breaks during HS and College where we did our own thing and explored we always came back to each other. Basically a ""no one is better than you"" scenario and it has been great ever since. 

I went to an out of state school and had my own place, she dropped out of college for personal reasons. After college I chose to move back home with her and start our lives together. She got a job at a pharmacy quickly becoming their most needed employee bending over backwards to keep her (PTO, schedule, benefits). I started on my career path and quickly found it wasnt exactly what I had in mind but I took it in stride. She worked full time making just above minimum wage while I make 5x what she does. I have always supported us and it wasnt an issue because she was working and I love her. 

We had our first in 2016 and it was rough but amazing and I couldn't be happier. She started working less and we had to pay for daycare and all the expenses that come with me commuting into NYC for work. Again it was tight but we made it work, I'd take side jobs and work OT a lot and eventually over the last 4 years job hopped getting raises with each new company (only way to make more money is to get a better offer somewhere else). Now I am making a little more than I was but our family is growing and expenses are as well. She then got pregnant again and had our son 2 weeks ago, she is obviously not working and I ended up losing my job when the company folded but it was at the end of our lease and being uncertain we couldnt sign another and had to move in with her mother which just makes me feel like a fucking failure. 

Before the baby was born she was still working now part time at the pharmacy making half of what she did. She has never finished school and doesnt have any skills really except what she learned at the pharmacy (ended up being the one in charge of controls and corosponding with the DEA). She is saying she wants to get a better paying job when her leave is up and not go back to the pharmacy but I know how finding a job is since I have done it a lot even if her mother got her an interview already.

I am just feeling a lot of resentment right now because she has been complaining I don't help out enough. I get maybe 4 hours of sleep a night and commute an hour each way to go to work to provide for our family while she doesnt work and when she did she made peanuts. I have been the main bread winner for our entire relationship and I think I deserve a little credit. I was diagnosed with adhd and depression last month,  when thinking about it, the symptoms had been going on for years I just thought it was normal. I had a mental breakdown from all the pressures to provide, the fact we had to move in with her mother (that angrily she has blamed me for losing my job on once or twice), and just job and money stress that all falls on me.  I just feel like I have done everything for this family, I quit great jobs with great coworkers whom i would call friends just to make more money because she just doesn't make enough. I never told her I felt this way but my best friends from college all went to LA after school and work lucrative careers in media and film, that was my dream job but I couldnt ask her to come to LA with me and couch surf until I made enough to get a place. So I gave that dream up, I've made my peace with it but it still is something I have sacarficed for our family. I have done everything in my power to give us a great life and now I just feel like a failure for us losing the lease and forcing us to move into her parents house until we save enough. 

I have sacraficed my dreams and my own happiness so I can provide for our kids and she still has the audacity to say I dont help enough. She never thanks me for any of this and doesnt seem to care at all or realize what ive given up for us. I would do it all again in a heartbeat but it would be nice to be appreciated without me having to throw all that in her face.

Sorry for the rant but I needed to get this off my chest and get advice from some people who were in my shoes.


PS - I love her to death and am not leaving her, I just want some appreciation which I hope isnt too much to ask for. We also have sex like once a week since I know someone will ask",relationship_advice

t3_dlgaod,My brother is going to jail on Thursday for 2 years. My parents are over a hundred thousand dollars in debt. They have no idea. Help.,"This might be long. Please bear with me because my thoughts are all over the place and I can‚Äôt stop crying. 

TLDR: my brother is going to jail but doesn‚Äôt want to tell my parents until the last minute, to avoid having them see him in court. I want to tell them but I don‚Äôt want to betray my brothers trust. Please help. Everything is fucked up. 


My family consists of me (F26), my sister (28), my brother (24) and my parents (60s). My sister lives with her fianc√© about 15 min away from my parents. Her relationship with them is terrible. Her and my parents don‚Äôt speak unless my dad initiates. [My mom hasn‚Äôt spoken to her in almost 6 months. In those 6 months, my mom didn‚Äôt speak to me for 3. The only reason she didn‚Äôt speak to me was bc I begged her to reconcile with my sister. That is a whole other story that I can‚Äôt get into because I just don‚Äôt have the energy.] My brother lives at home with my parents.  I live in a different state, a couple thousand miles away. I go to school full time and work full time in order to put myself through school. It is not enough so I have to get financial aid. This semester my financial aid fell through so I was forced to pay out of pocket. I took a hit to my bank account and it drained me $5000, 3/4 of my savings. My parents do not financially support me as I would feel extremely uncomfortable asking for any help - especially being in this situation now. We have always been a tight knit family who prided themselves on openness with each other - or so I thought. 

My brother was found guilty of a crime (please don‚Äôt ask - I won‚Äôt discuss) at the beginning of this year. As concisely as I can put it, it completely broke my family. For a couple months after his trial started, my parents and he went to family therapy and individual therapy. My parents no longer go as they can not afford it. My brother has been going consistently every week since. I wanted to attend therapy but could not afford it. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting here. He has been attending court dates since March and his final hearing is on Thursday (two days from now) and he will most likely be going away for 2 years, at least. My parents have not attended any of his court dates at the request of my brother. He is ashamed, embarrassed, saddened and angry at himself. He knows that broke my parents trust and devastated the family. He says he remembers the look on their faces when they first bailed him out of jail at the beginning of the year. He can‚Äôt imagine seeing their faces again when he is out away. 

My mom is the one most affected by this. She is not working atm, and hasn‚Äôt been for the past year due to medical reasons. My dad is the only source of income and a small one at that.  A bunch of pipes burst in their kitchen almost right after they bailed my brother out of jail. She has been keeping herself busy and distracted by working on the house and fixing everything. Because they had to replace appliances and the entire hardwood floor due to the pipes, money has been even more scarce. I don‚Äôt know how often they all talk to each other about the elephant in the room, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very often. Although my family has been open about many things, this is the one thing they refuse to bring up or address. The house renovations has been a huge distraction for the three of them and has given them something to do on a daily basis. My brother doesn‚Äôt work so he stays home to help. 

I have only been home twice since everything happened. I can‚Äôt afford to keep going home and miss school and work. I am barely scraping by as it is. My heart is broken. I love my family and I don‚Äôt know how to help other than calling them every other day to talk with them. I wish I could help out financially but it‚Äôs just not feasible. I wish I could hangout with my brother before he goes but I‚Äôm not physically there. I wish my sister had a better relationship with my parents so that they could have someone physically there giving emotional support. I have no one out here to turn to and no financial means of getting therapy. I have thought it over and over again but I just can‚Äôt afford it with the bills I already pay. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. 

My brother will be going away for 2 years minimum on Thursday. My parents know that he is going to court, but they think it‚Äôs just another court date and that he will come back after. My brother doesn‚Äôt want to tell them that he won‚Äôt be coming back. I have pleaded with him to tell them as he owes them that much. They are our parents and they deserve to know if they‚Äôre not going to be able to see their son for the next two years. They have already been through so much that him leaving without notice will tear them apart. My mom has cried on my shoulder and over the phone about everything. She‚Äôs scared my brother has ruined his life and I‚ÄôM scared that she feels 100% responsible. I am deeply afraid my mom will have a mental break. Every time I‚Äôve spoken on the phone with her, it seems more and more erratic. It was subtle at first but I can‚Äôt help thinking that it‚Äôs just brewing waiting to happen. And my father. God. He is trying to be so strong but I can see in his eyes that he needs to cry. It physically pains me to see my parents like this without being able to do anything. 

I‚Äôm so sorry this is all over the place. I‚Äôm trying to be coherent but it‚Äôs so hard to write it all out properly. I need help. Do I tell my parents? My brother will feel betrayed and I don‚Äôt want him hating me before I don‚Äôt see him for 2 years. How can I convince him to tell my parents? Please help me. I feel like I‚Äôm at the lowest point I‚Äôve ever been. I‚Äôm struggling in another state by myself while my family is literally breaking down before my eyes. I don‚Äôt know if I need advice or just someone to talk to. Please help.",relationship_advice
t3_dlkrpr,I (36M) am having problems with my wife‚Äôs (28F) phone habits,"Recently I‚Äôve begun to notice my wife texting and scrolling Facebook excessively when we go on dates and when we have dinner. At times she‚Äôs clearly having a conversation with a friend when we‚Äôre together, and it‚Äôs as if she‚Äôs only half paying attention to what‚Äôs happening around her. I can tell when she is simply waiting for the next text. 

This really bothers me because focused attention is how I express love, but bringing it up makes me feel needy and insecure. As if I‚Äôm trying to control her. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be confrontational and want to approach this in a positive manner so we can have a constructive dialogue. But I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being insecure/crazy or if this is something that‚Äôs worth the possible stress to bring up.

t3_dlhquh,We're kinda stuck,"Alright, I'll keep this simple and short. I told my closest friend that I have feelings for her. She told me she has some for me too. So we were a bit drunk and ended up sleeping together at her place and kissed once. I spent the next night at her place too. Didn't kiss, but cuddled and held hands. The problem is communication. We've talked about having difficulties talking to each other about personal stuff. Like the second morning I woke up, wrapped my arm around her and she grabbed my hand and held it closer. We could've talked, but we just laid there for an hour until she was like ""okay we better get up"". Why is it so hard to talk? How to improve it? Should we just wait to get more comfortable? Maybe it's just weird to finally 'be able' to be closer. Thanks.",relationship_advice

We've known each other for a while, but in the last couple of months we've talked and flirted, at least I hope that's what you would call it, more than ever! It's really exciting. Often we sit next to each other and when we talk she touches me a lot on the arm, and when I tease her just a bit she sometimes squeezes my arm and hits me. I also touch her arm to show my interest. Also, when I lean in to see something on her computer she doesn't pull away when we touch each other.  What would the next step in touching be?

t3_dlhqcp,Possibility of getting back together,"I posted this in the BreakUp and dating advice community (by mistake), but got no response.

This is going to be a long post. I'm a 23 year old girl who is experiencing her first breakup. The breakup happened on September 26th, 2 days before my birthday. 

The relationship lasted for almost 4 years. We met in first year in college, when I was 19 and he was 18. We are studying physics and the flirting started when we were discussing about solving problems and the material in general. We're from different cities, but it wasn't really a problem for us since we were seeing each other every day in classes, and after them. We survived the summers without seeing much of each other because we weren't really able to make the commute, but again, it wasn't a big problem. In the beginning of the relationship I told him that I have 2 deal breakers - the first one was no sex until I have only a few exams until graduation, and the second one was cheating. I also told him that if he doesn't agree not to do these things, that we shouldn't even start a relationship since it will be a lot harder to break it once emotions are present. He said that he doesn't mind these ""conditions"", so we started to build a relationship.

Since I'm from Europe, in our second year, I spent the summer in the US, on work and travel program. My ex didn't come with me even though I asked him to. When he finally decided to pick up the phone, he missed the deadline for applying by a few days. So I went alone. I wrote a journal for him about what was happening with me for the whole summer, and then 3 more months when I got home because I wanted to finish the whole notebook, cover to cover, and I gave him that for our anniversary. Since we didn't see each other for 3 months that summer, I somehow ended up breaking my word in a sense, and from then we started to have oral sex. Fast forward to the next year, I got genital herpes from him and I survived the biggest physical and emotional pain in my life in that period. I thought about breaking up with him, but my motto in life is you don't give up on the people you love, you give your best to make it work. And I did that. 

Everything was fine, or so I thought, until this summer. My ex went to a conference in a different country, with students from our college. I didn't because I couldn't afford it. I was bothered by my ex not asking me whether he should go. I've never stopped him from anything he wanted to do or say. I was never jealous. Anyways, the internet reception was very bad, and since he was on the conference, we couldn't really get in touch. One day we had a small argument. On that day he made out with one of the younger students from our college, after having a few beers, apparently. He told me this a day after he got back. He wanted for us to split right away, but after a lot of crying from the both of us, and a lot of begging from my side, he agreed to think about it. He said he'd need a month to think about it, but that was too much for me, and I didn't want to ruin my birthday which is in the end of September, so we agreed that we'll talk about after 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks I never said anything about our relationship and where we're headed.

Before we met after the 2 weeks we agreed on, he broke up with me on the phone (we were in different cities) for the first time. 5 hours after that call, he called me again and asked me to get together, which we did. When we met in person, we talked about everything, but the biggest problem was our future. We always wanted to apply for scholarships and to go to a different country on postgraduate studies. I asked him if he'd do that I wasn't able to go with him because he's a better student than I am and there is a real possibility for him to be accepted, but not me. His definitive answer was 80% he won't do it without me. But after the cheating, I cannot agree on us living in different countries, and I told him that.

In the next 2 weeks, from September 15th, the more we talked, the more I had a feeling that we would fall apart. The last straw was arguing about my birthday. I told him repeatedly that I need him by my side on my birthday party, and he didn't want to come. He said he didn't want to act like everything is alright when it isn't. But I didn't see it that way and I still don't. We had that fight for a few days and it really hurt me. We broke up 2 days before my birthday. Since this is my first relationship, and I'm an introvert, I asked him to come to my house on my birthday so I could have a last kiss and some hugs. And he came.

We decided to try and stay friends because we're colleagues and can't really avoid each other in college. But also because we care very much for each other, or so I want to think. After we broke up we talked about what happened, but I'm still confused. He insists that we want different things - his priority in life is career, and mine is family, but I honestly don't think that we couldn't make the relationship work because of that. He keeps telling me that I did nothing wrong, and that I'm a very good person with a lot of qualities, and yet he left me. I can't make sense of it. At first I cried a lot, then I was numb for weeks, and now I'm very emotional. This Saturday we're supposed to meet because he has to give me back the books I borrowed him. When we were chatting today, I was telling him how I really am and he asked me if I still have feelings for him. I replied with, I'm not crying these days without a reason. And then he asked me if I wanted to talk about us on Saturday.

I have no idea what to expect. I invested everything I had in this relationship. I was blindsided by its ending. In the beginning I said that cheating is a deal breaker for me. After the breakup, I kinda understand him because other things came to surface, which I couldn't believe. It turned out that my ex kept quiet about all the little things that bothered him, even though I always insisted that we should be open and honest about everything, so we can solve problems immediately and not have them again. He kept quiet until he snapped and cheated. 

This is the biggest psychological trauma I've ever experienced. And I've been depressed long before the breakup. And now I have no idea what to do. We had a lot of beautiful moments together. I thought he was the one, until he gave up on us. Now he wants to talk about us, and I don't know what to do. I still love him, and I think he still loves me, but sometimes love isn't enough. I have no idea what to say if he wants us to get back together. I'm clueless and my whole life is on hold because of this...

t3_dlkp8m,"how do i be friends with my ""ex"" after a long and not-so-great history?","i never officially dated the guy (as in we never called each other girlfriend/boyfriend) but we were serious. liked each other for years, etc. we became closer (and hence started ""dating"") when i was in a really bad time and place in my life. i regret it a lot, but i know for a fact that i was toxic as hell to him. i didn't mean to, but i treated him like shit. (side note: i was eventually diagnosed with bpd but i don't think it is a good excuse for the way i treated him.) but moving on with the question. fast forward about a year of him dealing with my bullshit and my whirlwind of emotions, and i ""broke up"" with him. yeah, i know, i'm dumb. but i told him that our ""relationship"" wasn't worth the pain i caused him, that i was going to leave (moving away from the country), etc. it wasn't the first time i said things like that, because we were on-off, but it was the first time it stuck. we broke up, stopped talking, i avoided him. a few weeks later, i went crawling back, and he said no. he told me that he didn't see me that way anymore, and that he wanted to be friends. i told him okay, but i went and... did some things to myself, cried myself to sleep, and continued avoiding him. since then, he has been incredibly kind. we are in a community together, and once he was planning an event where we ended up in the same group. someone pulled me aside to ask if i was okay, since he knew that i wasn't yet entirely comfortable around him. he has never treated me differently, is always polite and kind, and is genuine in wanting to be friends. all this time (and even now), he doesn't know about my mental illness. (this may not seem like much but my diagnosis changed a lot for me and my relationships with others. people were more understanding and helped me as i took steps to control it, but he didn't know anything about it and was endlessly patient and kind even without knowing why i was so toxic. this meant a lot to me.) it's been a while since that has happened, and i hate myself for it, but i can't bring myself to be friends with him. i've liked him for more than half my life, and it's hard for me to see him in just a platonic way. he's moving on (i think he has a girlfriend now) but i can't stop thinking about the time he told me he loved me. (more tragic backstory but those words mean a lot to me.) not to mention, every time i look at him, i'm reminded of the shitty person i'm trying not to be, of how unworthy i was and am. i can tell that he wants to be friends, and that my avoiding him is hurtful, especially since we were friends before this and our friendship died when our ""relationship"" did. i'm trying my best to be friends with him too, but i just don't know how to. please advise. thank you.

t3_dlko29,My (22M) parents lead to my disorder therapist thinks. I don't know what to do.,"Okay so this is my first post ever. So I'll make it as short as I can.

Basically when I was 18 I smoked weed had a panic attack and got a mental disorder called Depersonalisation/Derealization disorder. (Won't go into much detail). But basically had been a part of my life since. 

I have been to a few therapist about this as it's killing me and did make me question to take my life or not. But basically my therapist believes the cause to be emotional neglectment as a kid. 

I didn't think much of it at first but now it's starting to click with me why I never feel like myself at he, never Really talk to them as I would a friend etc. And it's killing me as we now have a okay relationship. But I can't and won't spend time with them as I have a lot of resentment. My dad wants to go for drinks and make plans with me weekly and I always say no, but never explain why. I think he knows he messed up as a father and is trying to make it up to me. I know my parents love me and care, just weren't there for me when I needed them. 

Should I talk to them about it? I'm terrified of breaking there hearts, or them laughing at the fact that I think they are the rout cause of my disorder.

Its not a big deal in the family or with me, and i have no problem with her being like that, its not ideal but i mean who hasnt flaws. The problem is that she usually gives her worst in relationships. She is manipulative, she is controlling, she has crazy mood swings, she pretty much destroys the other person if he lets her. The thing is she has never been with anyone too weak. She was still crazy, but not abusive. Now she is with this guy from a year. He is so sweet, shy, i swear to god one of the sweetest guy i have ever seen in my Life, so genuine and kind. The problem is that he is so kind he cant see when someone is very evil, he is also very immature, meaning just that he hasnt still understood what is bad for him and how to stand up for himself. This year for him... I felt so fucking bad for him you guys have no idea... my sister would scream at him at everything, she would mock him, he would come to our home to make up for whatever stupid thing my sister would have told him he did wrong, also at night, and so cry at our door while my sister is insulting him. It really breaks my heart to hear him cry. This is basically the third time in this weak i have heard her basically killing the soul of this poor guy, screaming and yelling. I have tried to talk to her about It many times. There has been periods when she thought she had a problem. But nothing did change. Now she just dismisses me and gets irritated and start to ignore me untill i go away. The answer is: should i talk to his boyfriend about trying to break up with her? Or something else? Or shouldnt i intervene? He will never break up with her, he acts like she is a queen, stroking the fuck out of her ego. My family wont intervene because its a quirky thing to them.

t3_dlg3j1,Do i confront her?,"Hi Reddit,

I'm going to try and make this as short as possible so here we go. I've been dating this girl (ill call her Lexi) for around 2 months now. We live a couple hours away but visit every week/other week and it's always so incredible when we do meet! I love this girl with my whole heart and I know that she's deeply in love with me too from how she acts, speaks, everything.

Around a month ago Lexi told me that a lad from her college course has been flirting with her a lot since the start, but recently asked her to go on a date. She assured me she denied him and I believed her. They hang out all the time together in a big group drinking and smoking etc... She told me he stayed at her accommodation one night as he ""had no way of getting home"". I know how bad this act is but I couldn't help myself... but she left herself logged in on Snapchat on my phone earlier and I couldn't resist clicking this same lads name just to see if anything had been said. I found the whole conversation from when he asked her out, but, I also found the responses she put to him. He asked if Lexi would go on a date with him to which she replied ""I would"". I wrote down a lot of the things she said to him and will list them now to see how you guys take them as I am unsure and it hurts more than anything. 
""don't know if it's just me being lustful"" 
""I didn't wanna make moves n shit""
""I would"" (he asked would u go on a date)
""mixed signals man, you're playing with ma mind""
""different day, different me""
""I don't want you to back off""
""I find you very VERY attractive you know? But Im not some easy ass person, I‚Äôve known you for a short amount of time""
""And idk how long you‚Äôve felt like this or if it‚Äôs even real at all yk?""
""But I want to know what you think now you know? I don‚Äôt want it to just be because you‚Äôve smoked/ drank and in the morning you‚Äôre futtin like NAAAAAAH""
""don't know if it's just me being lustful""

Some of the responses such as her calling him so attractive and that she feels lust towards him are really taking a toll on me. Any help thanks",relationship_advice

t3_dlkif0,Ideas for small ways to show love when you're not physically present,"Hi all, I was hoping I could borrow your braincells for a while to help me find some small things I can do for my fianc√©e while I'm physically separated from her.  


Long story short, we're in a long distance relationship and things have been very rough recently - a pretty big argument led to some trouble communicating for both of us, and it coincided with a mental breakdown and depressive streak for me (unrelated, but it certainly made things worse). I'm getting help, we're improving communication, and we're going to see a therapist together when I'm next in the country to improve how we communicate between each other. We're making all the right steps, but she's been having a shitty time outside of this as well, and I'm trying to find small things to just try and brighten her day a little.   


I've already sent flowers, and left the odd note, but don't want to drown her in purchased affection or overwhelm her with messages. I'm planning to start the photo album of us she always talks about for Christmas, but any ideas are more than welcome.",relationship_advice
t3_dl2h42,"[25/M] My former close friend [25/M] told me something that makes me want to end our friendship, and tell his fianc√© what happened.","TL;DR My formerly close friend acted incredibly shitty and rude all weekend on top of revealing that he recently cheated on his fianc√©. 


My friend, or potentially previous friend, flew in to hangout for the weekend since he lives across the country. I haven‚Äôt seen him in a long time, but we lived together in college and have been fairly close since then. 


He has always had questionable morals, ranging from stealing to cheating on tests and being proud of getting away with it. But we have a lot of common interests and have always gotten along well so I overlooked his character flaws for the most part.


This weekend it seemed like his true nature finally came to light and I was honestly shocked by how naive I had been to the kind of person that he is. He constantly made derogatory comments about women to my girlfriend, and about my sisters. He made numerous homophobic and transphobic comments, and he wouldn‚Äôt tone down his over the top language around my very young family members. I could honestly type out several more paragraphs of incredibly rude things that he did throughout the weekend, but I think you get the point of the type of person that he revealed himself to be.


I was very frustrated and embarrassed by his actions, but the final nail in the shit head coffin came the second night when we had a moment to ourselves. He told me in an offhanded and complete nonchalant manner that he had cheated on his fianc√© with a prostitute a few weekends back while on a trip with another friend. His fianc√© is an incredibly sweet person and deserves so much better than this piece of shit. She is career driven and incredibly smart, but she also seems very naive and quiet. They have been together longer than I have known my friend, and honestly I feel sick to my stomach about the situation. My gut tells me that I should break off any friendship I have with the guy and tell his fianc√© what he told me, but I am not very close with his fianc√© and don‚Äôt want to overstep my boundaries. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I should do, or the best way to do it.",relationship_advice

We have very similar senses of humor and I absolutely adore him. He said he loves me too, and I believe it, because he acts differently around me than I‚Äôve ever seen him act. I‚Äôve also seen some red flags: he has a big temper. Granted, he hasn‚Äôt ever had any steady relationships or friendships other than his family, and usually I am able to calm him down, which I don‚Äôt think is normal for him.

I think i am afraid of losing someone and being alone again but my mind doesn't stop worrying about every circumstances as my previous relationship was of 4 year and we were marrying 4 months later she found some old friend and left me.

After that i am scared of relationships tbh, I want this girl to be happy but my freaking mind just doesn't stop and i get anxiety attacks help me if anyone can.",relationship_advice
t3_dl8iw8,My husband asked out another girl on a date,"This is a long story and I am very nervous to post this so sorry if it drones on a lot. 

Met this guy and hes great. We're dating for about a year of long distance and I break it off because long distance sucks. Two days later we get back together because we decided that long distance is the problem and not us so he moves out to me.

During the two days that we broke up he meets this girl and they make out a little and exchange numbers but don't do anything serious. I am alright with that, we were broken up. 

Fast forward 4 years. Things actually worked out and we got married 6 months ago. 

But every now and then he texts this girl. Sometimes its innocent friend-like texts that I don't care about and other times its more. Him telling her how beautiful she is, how hot she looks, asking her for photos, asking her is he can come see her, and most recently: he asked her out on a date. She turned him down as she now has a boyfriend. 

You may be thinking ""How do you know all of this?"" 
-Because I am a horrible wife with trust issues and I steal his phone when he's not looking to obsessively read through his texts and 'check up on him'. For the record: I know this is shitty and horrible and I shouldn't read through his texts because Im going to find something that I don't want to see but I am almost addicted and don't know what to do. 

We've fought about this before. When I saw that he was texting her all the time and she was writing him love letters in the mail. When she showed up to his work (when we lived in a different state). When she was sending him very sexually explicit messages but he deferred her. 

It always ends the same. I am a horrible partner for sneaking around and reading through his phone (which I am) and he is just sad and wants friends. They're just friends. I promise to stop reading through his phone and he promises nothing because in his mind he has done nothing wrong. I keep going through his phone and he just starts deleting messages between them. 

Now the thing is: He isn't physically cheating on me with her. She lives 4 hours away and there is never time to drive over there and back. He isn't cheating but to me it feels like he's saving her. She doesn't know I exist. This I can gather from the texts and from the fact that I have literally met every other person in his life except for her. She thinks he is single and has been for the last 4 years. When I ask him about this he says that they don't talk about that kind of stuff. I'm unsure if ~given the chance~ he would actually cheat. 

I am looking for advice. I see a couple options in front of me and none of them look good.
1. Confront him. Which will end up like every other time and start the repetitive process all over again. 
2. Forget it. He isn't actually cheating so I could move on and not worry about it. But honestly keep secretly stressing about it and checking his phone.
3. Get crazy. Go complete crazy wife status and do something stupid like messaging her on Facebook or changing her number in his phone to a free app phone number and pretending to be her. Lets me honest. I can't do this and it would blow up in my face 100%. 
4. Ultimatum. I hate ultimatums and if I make him choose between us he will choose her out of spite. I know him this much.
5. File for divorce. I love this guy. Hes perfect for me in every way except for this shit. I don't want to get divorced and believe in working through problems. 

I feel stuck. And helpless. And I can't talk to any of my friends about this out of fear of judgement, so here I am Reddit. Begging for help.",relationship_advice
t3_dlfz9q,How to know you have lost a dear friend?,"Hi :)

I (20F) and my best friend know each other since 3rd grade. 

We both now go to different uni, but that never seemed a problem until recently. I don't know how to explain this, but since last one year I feel like in our friendship I'm invisible. Does that make sense? 

Like, in the beginning I would try to talk about, say, this class I'm taking or this hobby I'm thinking about perusing, and one way or another she will make the convo about her. I never got mad about that. Never even gave it a thought at that time, honestly.

But soon things got worse. Stuff used to happen. I used to either distance myself till I calmed down or never fussed about it.

Until one day we both decided to meet at this cafe and she never showed up. I waited for two hours and then went back home. 

She showed up at my house that night and said she couldn't make it because, quoting her here, ""I was with (bf's name) and lost track of time.""

At first I sat her down and said it was ok. I know I'm wrong here. I should have said here that I'm mad, but she was in my house and I didn't want to be mean. I'm sorry if that doesn't make any sense. 

We talked for some time. For the first time it was awkward. When she left, I thought about everything.


There are two ppl in every relationship. Lately, I feel  like I was the only one. I'm sorry this is so long. I guess I'm venting.

We have not had any problems, we are really happy together. However, she does not want a relationship, while I want to be in one. The reason why I want a relationship is because I am falling in love with her. We act like we are in one - cuddle, spending time together and having sex. She does not want a relationship because of past experiences. She has lost hope in other people. She is happy with me. Due to our differences in views someone will end up hurt at the end unless we solve it. The thing is that being officially in a relationship would not change anything in reality.  Every time we speak about this, we don‚Äôt end up with a decision. I want to make her happy and bring her faith in people, because she is a really good person I care about.  I am confused about what decision I should make.

I've had previous relationships but it's been the same situation where I've always felt too uncomfortable bringing my exes home/introducing her to my family. Am I being unreasonable with all of this?

t3_dlhark,"My boyfriend has anger issues, should I be concerned?","We've been together for more than a year and I notice how he handles himself when he's angry. The one that shocked me was his road rage once. There was a car in front of us that was on the wrong lane on a traffic light. The car wants to turn right but he was on the lane that goes straight. When the light was green, this asshole refused to go straight, he keeps signaling he wants to go right and wait for the light to go right turns green. My boyfriend kept honking and we eventually had to go over to our left side lane to be able to move. The problem is there was quite a traffic on the left lane too, so it was pretty hard to cut the current. Cars behind us had been honking non stop cause the car in front of us basically stopped the whole lane. 

When we managed to cut the left lane current, my boyfriend slowed down and stopped for few seconds, open his side window, and banged on the stupid car's side window (the one in front of us that refused to move). Oh by the way the steering wheel is on the right side in here. I was really shocked when my boyfriend banged the stupid car's window, I mean, granted the car was an asshole, but that's also rude of him to do that. Anyway, I don't really know what happened, but lots of cars behind us still honking, then my boyfriend proceeded to put his middle finger up to everyone behind, which I really don't get why he'd do that. Some motorbike behind us then banged our car from behind and swore at us. This was like a trigger for my boyfriend. Said motorbike sped up and went ahead of our car, and my boyfriend was so mad his face was all red and literally sped up chasing the motorbike. I had to really squeeze his arm and shouted STOP IT like twice or three times before he finally slowed down. He was silent the whole way home. I told him that he needs to control his anger, that with that kind of attitude he could get in serious trouble in the future, then he appologized and said he understands.

He also often says how he wishes he could kill people that are trash to society, or someone who's being a complete asshole towards him. The other day he told his customer that he can't smoke in the restaurant, but this customer just smirked and continued smoking in front of him. My boyfriend told me he wished he could slit the customer's throat and gouge his eyes and feed them to the rats. 

Boyfriend never hurts anyone, he's never been in a fight and he never acts violent towards me or anyone even when he's angry, never had a history with violence or alcohol or drugs either. I just wonder if this is all just crazy venting talk everytime he's angry or if it's a sign that he might need some therapy and it's a red flag for me in the future when we're tied down. Am I crazy for being concerned?

She is rearranging her life now, I am currently doing the same, but also have to deal with my trauma from childhood

t3_dlk6ax,I'm not sure if I trust my boyfriend.,"I just posted this on r/confession, but wanted to know this sub's opinion as well. 

I'll just call him BF for the sake of simplicity. He's 17 and I'm 16. 

We've been together for about a month, and we've known each other for about 5 or 6 months. To be blunt about it, I'm a virgin and he's not. He's been with about 7-8 girls other than me and has been sexually active with all of them. This isn't too out of the ordinary, and before we dated he was still very open about them and most other things. Once we started dating though, it started getting pretty interesting. I've got pretty bad trust issues, always thinking someone is hanging out with me for either self gain or out of pity, due to growing up with my sister, who I might talk about in a later story. This may be impacting my view on things but nevertheless I'll start telling the story.

After we started dating, I swear he's talked about his exes more, and everything he says about them is a direct hit to their sexual preferences. He constantly is making fun of them and is telling story's about them and mocking them. After a while of being together, he went into his notes and showed me a document of people who were/are close to him. For every person, he has a name, practically a biography explaining who they are, and under that, he has a paragraph describing any blackmail he has on them. He also has photos. I am on that list and have looked at my profile. It only has the biography, and it's all in kind words. I haven't given him any info that could be used as blackmail, at least I think, but my gut feeling is really telling me that he has a different folder containing everything on me that he separated, knowing I would look at the current ones because I have my fingerprint in his phone. I'm genuinely kind of scared to do anything personal with him out of fear of being another number that he'll use as a funny story to entertain his next girlfriend. I may be paranoid, but the whole thing seems pretty shady to me. He's also done some questionable things in the past that I can talk about if you guys want to know, I just don't want this to be too long of a read.",relationship_advice

t3_dlk32p,I sometimes [19F] am an emotional wreck and I don't want to bother my boyfriend [19M] with it.,"So, let me get started. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 months, it's both our first relationship and it's working pretty good right now. I always knew that I was kinda an unstable person but I never knew that it was this bad. Yeah, to be honest, it isn't that bad but I'll explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I found out that I'm kinda a jealous person. He sometimes talks with his old crush and I'm jealous about her. In my eyes, she is a great match for him and I feel kinda left out. I do have his Instagram account and I sometimes read the conversations that they had. No, I'm not a psycho girlfriend. He gave his password to me and he has mine because we sometimes send each other memes of private accounts. I told him that I sometimes read his and I get jealous about it. He always tells me not to worry about anything and that he loves me but I still am really insecure. 

I sometimes go through periods that I'm really sad, don't have energy for anything and feel really insecure. I cry almost everyday in that period and after 3/4/5 days, sometimes 1/2 weeks, it just stops. In that period of time I try to breakup with my boyfriend or just get triggered easily. I never really have an argument for it but it just happens that way.

I'm now going again through something like it and I don't want to bother him again. I hate to just ask really insecure questions like: 'do you still love me? Do you think that we are a good match? Do you think I'm annoying?' It just doesn't stop and I just don't know what to do. Most of the time I just try to distance myself from him so I don't do anything wrong. I really do love him but I question so many things in this period of time. I sometimes think that I can be depressed but depression isn't like this. Depression has so many more symptoms. I would like to answer some questions if it helps.

Then 2 friends died (one overdose one jumped in front of a train)  since that happend I decided to turn around and make something out of my life, it turned out to be really good, have a good job. A dog , motor bike, house , car and since half a year a girlfriend I love.  At first I didn‚Äôt know she smoked weed so was pretty surprised when she showed me her supply and asked if I wanted to smoke together. (She lives 3h drive from my place)  so I freaked a little bit inside and asked how much she smoked which she replied to only on weekends sometimes.  Since then our contact went down from everyday to couple day a week  and it‚Äôs becoming less and less.  I confronted her about that. And at first she said things like: it‚Äôs been a though time moving and so on but after a while she admitted to be smoking weed every day whenever she could,  and just ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want me to freak out or worry‚Äù.  

It‚Äôs been on my mind since the weekend and I honestly don‚Äôt want to be around in that frequent drug use anymore, I love her  with my whole heart and think she deserves a chance. Because no one ever gave her a real one. I told her that I would never let her down and she replied crying that no one ever said that to her. Right now I really feel hurt, because I don‚Äôt want to let her down. But I also can‚Äôt be around drugs anymore it‚Äôs killing me. I‚Äôm having a traumatic experience with weed , she doesn‚Äôt. It hurts me that she mostly chooses weed over a call or good talk with me. And I don‚Äôt know anymore what a good decision would be.",relationship_advice
t3_dljye8,My [31F] GF says she went through my [29M] phone for no particular reason.,"I made a [post in another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dl4ya5/i_29m_sent_an_inappropriate_message_to_a_female/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) where my GF went through my phone and found an inappropriate message I sent to a female friend two months ago. We talked and she decided we can work it out and move past what I did. (Lucky me.)


However, this lead me to the question why she felt the need to go through my phone in the first place. I‚Äôm certain I haven‚Äôt done anything to trigger any suspicion that would warrant going through my phone. 

So when I asked her why, she basically said she went through it because ‚Äúit was going off‚Äù (push notifications from FB). She said she wasn‚Äôt looking for anything nor she was suspicious I was up to something; she just decided that she had go through my phone for no particular reason. She claims this is just something that she does. I asked, ‚Äúwhat if you didn‚Äôt find anything of concern, would you even tell me that you were snooping?‚Äù She said she wouldn‚Äôt even tell me. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what make of this. This seems like a symptom of something bigger, but I don‚Äôt know.

t3_dljyco,My (20F) Boyfriend (24M) relies a lot on me and I want to leave.,"My boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) have been dating for a year and a half now, however, there have been some issues that have hurt me and I'm not sure how to leave.

He recently struggled with getting help for an addiction that consumed him for the better part of eight months. While he was addicted, he had a bad temper and saw the world as out to get him. This frustration with everything going wrong in his life was taken out on me because I was always there. Before we were dating, I was there to listen when he needed someone to talk to about anxiety and depression. I became the only person he confided in.

At it's worst, there was name-calling and personal attacks daily based on characteristics he seemed to resent (ex. my family is middle-class while his is not, I am a certain ethnicity while he is not). He called me lazy for doing hobbies with my free time and talking to other friends often. Saying I had it too easy. He became paranoid that I had ""things"" with other men in our friend group and would constantly ask me if there was anything ""going on that he should know about"". The only acceptable activities were doing assignments for class, work, or helping family. I continued to be there when he was struggling with mental health but it began to seriously stress me out. There was a point where he would call me three to four times in the middle of the night and I would just turn my phone off because I could not handle what he would say to me. I decided that was enough and was going to meet him in person to discuss breaking up.

That day his manager at work pulled him aside and said he needed to get help, and my boyfriend decided to go to the hospital. He has completely turned around. He is working with a therapist and doctor to help manage his addiction and mental health. He is almost back to his pre-addiction self. There are still issues with constantly being negative and seeing things as one problem after another but it is getting better. He says I am his rock, and me being here is what is motivating him to keep going. He also tells me that he is working so hard to make a life for us and to help his family, that I am the reason he is going back to school to finish a degree.

I can't deal with that pressure. How he treated me before killed all the romantic love I had. I care about him as a person, but I don't see things romantically. It's hard to kiss or touch him anymore. I have talked to him numerous times about how I feel and he gets extremely defensive/upset. He profusely apologizes and asks why I still see him as the person he was while addicted and why I expect him to lash out. I want to leave but I don't want him to ruin all the progress he's made as a person and with his health. I'm the only person he relies on right now but I can't do this anymore.

Tl;dr - How to talk about breaking up with my boyfriend when he sees me as one of his only motivators.",relationship_advice
t3_dljxvj,UPDATE: How do I (25F) cope with my best friend no longer wanting anything to do with me over something I could not control,"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djma1l/how_do_i_25f_cope_with_my_best_friend_no_longer/)

So this isn't really an optimistic update but she did actually reply to me after 5 weeks. She mentioned how her bf was miserable and disappointed and felt let down, and that he feels like he has no friends here anymore and nobody gives a shit about him (she mentioned the meal 2 days before said meal) and she felt the need to also include that people made an effort for my bf's birthday meal. (We gave people more then 2 days notice but ok)

I went in alot about being sorry, how I sympathize he was disappointed, should have got a great birthday etc and then added but it sucked our friendship suffered for it. She said it did not suffer because we could not make it but because of the ""tone"" i took when she presented passive aggression.

Her: ""I only said see you another time ay and then you told me not to be shitty and take a tone like a parent scolding a child. I didnt appreciate it""

Me: ""Yeah you said see you another time after I explained what happened, that I would double check with my BF and that he could not even sit in the car from hospital to my house. And then I asked you to please not get shitty and I definitely did not ask or tell you to take a tone""

Her: ""What. You literally said those exact words. You said ""dont take that tone""

Me: ""No I didnt""

Her: ""Ok lol. This is exactly what I mean man""

Me ""Scroll up and look? It's literally right above""

Her: ""I cba""

Her: *Removed a message*

Her: "" I don't want to argue over semantics, the point I'm making is I wasn't being shitty and I hate that I felt like I wasn't allowed to be disappointed or annoyed at the situation, you immediately shut down a glimmer of passive aggression when you're so eager to be passive aggressive if something upsets or annoys you. I'm just tired, its stupid and I'm over it. But the space is helpful for us both and I think we need to rebuild our friendship because the way it was before was not healthy at all, it still isn't. ""

Me: ""How was it not healthy?""

Her: "" Kayleigh seriously just take a look at the whole conversation we've had just now, its fucked, it feels so draining and like such hard work, a friendship shouldn't be like that?  Surely you can see that right?""

Me: "" When you said was not healthy at all, I presumed you meant before anything happened""

Her: "" Look I don't wanna go into it, there's no need to upset each other.  Let's just leave it now.  I heard you're going to Portugal so that'll be nice won't it! ""

So I never ever said anything about taking a tone. And I genuinley felt my reaction to her blowing up at me was very reasonable, I told her I felt she would do the exact same as me in the same situation, that it wasn't some silly flu he's gone to the hospital for, that he can not sit down, and eventually it honestly felt like she was provoking so I stopped responding.

Not completely familiar with the term and I'm not sure If I'm throwing it around here but I feel like she was just gaslighting me?

t3_dljx27,How do you move on from someone (27M) when you (24F) hold so much regret and self blame?,"tl;dr: We split up 4 months ago, and I have been blaming myself every single day really. The first month I was doing ok, but I think I was in denial and was not open to seeing what I did wrong. It's really hit me from month 2 onwards and I am struggling.

The break up happened over text after he said that my insecurities were making him feel trapped and were amplifying him feeling unhappy. He said going on a break would be best for long-term happiness, but by that point I had become so emotionally drained, I was working, studying for exams and trying to make my relationship work. I told him he didn't make me feel special anymore and that I always wondered if he loved me. His response was that he could tell, and that he would be giving me more naturally if he hadn't been feeling like this, and so I ended it - all over text message :(.

A few days later I rang him because I felt like this was such an immature way to have handled things and I wanted us to talk face to face, but he said he was glad I sent the text message saying we shouldn't be together because if I hadn't we would have never broken up :(.

Here's the backstory:

The months leading up to us breaking up, I felt as though I was doing more in the relationship compared to what he was doing for me and it was really getting me down. It made me feel very insecure because about 6/7months prior he had compared me so his ex girlfriend. He said he was only giving me 50/60% and that his relationship with his ex was fire and that he wanted to take her around the world and hadn‚Äôt felt like that with me, and that he sometimes thought I needed to be with a loser boyfriend, but then said I‚Äôm the prettiest and most caring girl he‚Äôs ever been with. When I said that we should probably break up he said he really wanted to try and work on things as he wanted to give me more.

He felt really relieved he had gotten all of his feelings out because he‚Äôs the kind of guy who bottles everything up and so it seemed like he was making positive changes straight away, however, for me it took a lot longer because I was hurt.

As a result of everything, in the following months I became quite insecure. I subconsciously felt as though I had something to prove and forgot who I was a person. I guess I lost myself, and was no longer doing things that made me happy in the past and was so focused on my job, exams and him. My free time was going to see him and his family. I would put so much effort into everything I did for him, like making dinner for example. I would always try and make massive portions so they would last him the entire week if I wasn‚Äôt there a few days, i would do his laundry and clean his apartment too. I remember one time I was emptying the dishwasher and he perked up and said ‚Äòwow you‚Äôre going to make me propose at this rate‚Äô. I think I probably rolled my eyes jokingly at him but inside I guess I was really happy he said that.

Anyways, I work in the financial district and my exams were very tough, and I think the stress got the better of me and I seemed a bit sad at times / grumpy, although I was still prioritising him in my life. He didn‚Äôt like me sad and would say he felt like he was walking on egg shells around me which would make me feel like I would need to be switch on when I was with him.

I guess since he compared me to his ex girlfriend, I became a lot more aware of what I was doing in the relationship vs what he was doing. I started venting a lot to friends, and I was often scared to communicate this insecurity of mine because I knew he would be mad and tried to keep it all to myself. It was never that I didn‚Äôt trust him, but I didn‚Äôt trust our relationship lasting if that makes sense. I found it difficult to think too far into the future because I felt he would break up with me. A week before we broke up I remember stupidly texting him and asking what his views on cheating were as I guess I felt a bit nervous that he was going on a lads work holiday and I felt as though things were off between us. I have beat myself up about that text over and over, because I think that‚Äôs what made him decide to not be with me anymore.

When we broke up he said he had tried to make things work and I was very confused on what he had actually done to try. But looking back, I know he did try, he tried to be patient with me, but things were just getting worse for me in my head with feeling like I wasn't good enough. I used to look at other couples and wish that my boyfriend acted like that with me. I feel like I sabotaged the relationship in my head, and I know for a fact I will never meet someone who makes me laugh as much as he did. He was so incredibly charming, handsome and had a great personality :(.

t3_dljwlr,I (30TF) am into my roommate (31F) and don't know what to do.,"I am posting this on my alt account because its too easy to find me on the main and I know she gets on Reddit.

I am 30 trans-woman, she is 31 cis-woman.

I told her a few months back (like 3-4 months ago) that I had a crush on her. We talked about it and she never really gave a response. The conversation very much ended on an open note. About a month ago we moved in together and are now living as roommates.

Since we have moved in together, the conversation has never come up, but she has made some ""jokes"" that make me think that she is into me too. She joked about getting hers and hers towels. She frequently calls me ""babe,"" and ""Dear."" And the day after I had an ex over (because I'm a stereotypical lesbian, apparently) she asked a lot of questions about the relationship between me and my ex. She even asked, ""Do you think you'll be seeing her again?""

These couple things just kind of make me think that she is into me, but I am too nervous to bring it up again since we are living together. I don't want her to come back with a no and then everything is awkward. Also, if she says yes then we are suddenly in a much deeper of a commitment than I think either of us are ready for.

t3_dljq0r,I (22F) struggling with relationship anxiety in new-ish relationship (23m),"I have had a long history with depression and anxiety and unstable mental health in general, and about 5 months ago started dating a really wonderful friend of mine. So far the relationship has been going very well when it comes to us together, he is incredibly caring and supportive, but about a month ago I started relapsing with my mental health and experiencing intense anxiety and abandonment type issues. 

My previous relationship suffered a lot from mental problems from both abuse and also the toll my health took on it, and it has been really difficult for me to trust and move past that with this relationship and to also not become too dependent on my current SO. He is very understanding but I feel I am too dependent and stuck into a cycle I can‚Äôt get out of, where I now feel uncomfortable or unhappy when I am alone and I do not always trust myself. 
To explain further I have also been experiencing a lot of anxiety from our situation; I am currently living halfway across the world from my home on a temporary visa and only have another year until it expires, but I have lived here for a couple years and my SO lives here as well. I also have been experiencing mild loneliness from not being able to see family or friends from home, and in a way have started to sometimes feel jealous of my SO because of the large amount of time he gets to see family. I know this is my own choice/doing in moving far away, but I also feel these factors have led me to rely too much on him to avoid feeling lonely as I do not have many supports here and haven‚Äôt been able to form relationships easily given language barriers, etc.

I am wondering if reddit has any advice on how to get out of the unhealthy cycle and how to not become too reliant? I am quite a needy person by nature but I do feel I am suffocating the relationship and I also don‚Äôt want the anxiety I feel to negatively impact it. I also feel as though I may come off as crazy sometimes; he has seen some of my panic attacks and when I relapse and he has never observed these kinds of things to this extent of someone, and I feel it is too much to rely on someone to help constantly as I have been doing. Being alone has become painful and I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to deal with that, and I don‚Äôt want the relationship to suffer from my issues",relationship_advice

I‚Äôm having a difficult time trying to justify spending this money. This is not a trip I would go on if my brother wasn‚Äôt getting married. I don‚Äôt gamble, drink, golf, or spend much on food and I dislike travel in general.

I feel obligated to go so I‚Äôm kind of stuck. My brother and I are pretty close but he knows about my dislike for travel in general. I‚Äôve kept my mouth shut due to not wanting to spoil his wedding experience. I feel it‚Äôs a waste of money and wrong to expect people to shell out that kind of money. For contrast during our wedding, we paid for the tux rentals for the groomsmen because we didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience them with a $100-150 bill.  I feel like asking people to foot that bill and use their PTO is a lot. And quite frankly I think that‚Äôs what strikes the biggest nerve... being told how to use a substantial amount of money and time off.

How should I proceed? I feel I have to go but I will be upset the entire time.

t3_dljm9y,How can I (21M) tell my girlfriend (21F) that I am unhappy,"Hey everyone,

just as a disclaimer: I know that this might sound like an incredibly selfish issue. A lot of is possibly a problem of my courage and how I perceive arguments. But it would still be helpful to hear another opinion on this and get a different view on this.

My girlfriend an I have been together for almost four years. We had our ups and downs over the years but we have always come around on our differences. 
She is the cutest and most wonderful person I know (helpful, understanding, always interested in my life) and i love her a lot. No one makes me feel like she does and i do all i can to make her happy. I know that i‚Äôm not perfect (in most cases not ready to compromise, quite ambitious in terms of my career, unwilling to change routines) but i do the best i can.

And now for my problem: for the last months I haven‚Äôt been happy at all. I have tried so long to come to terms with this relationship and i have always told myself, that it will get better in the future. But the reality is that I‚Äôm not.

My girlfriend and i don‚Äôt have to a lot in common and so many conversations just feel boring and exhausting. I want to talk about my interests (politics, sports, video games, nerd topics) more often and I‚Äôve tried all i can but i just can‚Äôt develop any interest in hers (beauty, lifestyle, makeup).

I just can‚Äôt get along at all with her family. She lives with her grandparents and things with her parents do get quite rough from time to time. I just feel really uncomfortable when i am there, don‚Äôt feel at home and i just can‚Äôt imagine a future with this family. I just start to feel quite depressed and just sad when i‚Äôm on my way to her.

I am a person that needs some time for myself since i want to try and do a lot of things and also enjoy time alone so much. It does not mean that i don‚Äôt want to spend time with her or something but that‚Äôs just how i am. She is the exact opposite and wants to spend as much time together as possible. I often feel like i can‚Äôt do what i enjoy but don‚Äôt want to upset her, so i stay unhappy. 
I am only 21 and so far i feel like doing so many compromises. And as i said this doesn‚Äôt really make me happy. I feel like missing out on so many things since all i do is stay at home with my gf most of the time.

It is not her fault since she doesn‚Äôt do anything wrong. But that‚Äôs just who i am and i‚Äôm not sure that i can/want to change myself in such a major way.
I know that i must talk with my gf but i just don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm afraid of this conversation and how to do it.
What of those things can i say to my girlfriend and any tips how to best proceed?

I know that those are very vague things and that i might be wrong in this situation. But how do you handle yourself when you are so unhappy in a relationship and how do you communicate it?

I‚Äôm sorry for this wall of text and if it‚Äôs too vague or not the right thing for this sub. I‚Äôm just open for anything that might be helpful.

t3_dljjrh,Is my sister manipulating me?,"TL;DR: My older sister claims she's doing certain things for my own good. Can't tell if she's manipulating me or if there's something wrong with my perception.

Both my sister and I have been struggling with weight, but fortunately enough for my sister she lost her excess weight sometime before college. However, I'm still struggling.

She would always tell me about all these diets and how I can't give up without trying and that I should give one a go. I started with a low-carb one by her recommendation. I lasted a week, it was my fault though. I didn't keep it going.
Weeks later she's telling me that all I need to do is watch what I eat. That it's okay for me to eat whatever I want as long as it's in moderation, but that I should try avoiding junk foods. Okay, I do that for some time. I feel fine. Until she starts giving me side-eyes of what I have on my plate, of foods that I bring home, what and how much I'm eating. At first, I didn't mind it, but as time went on it just got worse.
I remember one night she made burritos, she made a really unappetizing filling which she topped with some mayonnaise and some lettuce. The tortilla, the mayo and the lettuce are the only parts that I liked and I was hungry for more. I went into the kitchen and asked if there's more but that I'll skip the filling (I know), but she told me that ""better not. Unnecessary carbs."" and I said okay to which she said ""if you want it, take it. But know that it's just unnecessary calories and carbohydrates. It's up to you.""  So, I didn't take it.

Whenever I'd get home after a long day at school/hanging out with friends I'd find empty pizza boxes and takeout. At first, I was like ok, but I noticed it more frequently and I'm pretty sure it was because she never wanted me to eat/buy food for me.

Once, my sister's best friend, my sister and I were having a conversation. They were discussing things that bothered them (such as our parents commenting something regarding our physical looks). They started talking about food and her friend mentioned my sister's eating disorder. That she would binge and then purge because she was afraid she'd gain weight. She didn't look very happy that she mentioned that in my presence.

All of that, I completely disregarded because of the fact she was struggling with the same thing as me. Even though she made me feel miserable, binge in privacy when she wasn't around and not feel comfortable eating around her. 

But then, she started to do these things in other areas. 
She'd talk to me about college for my own good, but made me doubt my choices and made me chase something she never pursued.
She was always interested in chemistry, but couldn't get in because there were people that scored better than her. 
When it was time for me to choose a college, because of the fact I didn't know what the hell I wanted she would always tell me how great chemistry is and eventually, I'd bite. I'm pretty sure I made myself believe that I wanted to study chemistry even though deep down I still didn't know what the hell I wanted. I'm not denying that chemistry is interesting, I actually always enjoyed it in highschool and yes, it would always be fun to know more.. But, I was never 100% sure which just made me think that's not it.
""Try and see how it goes"" and ""you have nothing to lose if you just try"" would be the things she'd say to me which for whatever reason made me really stressed and I felt the need to pursue chemistry and that if I failed I somehow disappointed her.
I never did go to college because I failed my exams after screwing my mental health even further by stressing myself over something I never even wanted to study.

Few months ago, I was desperate to find a job because I needed a new laptop and I needed to pay her back some money I borrowed from her.
I'm extremely anxious and finding a job that wouldn't make my mental health even worse is... hard. So, of course, she steps in. She'd tell me that a friend of hers works for a courier company and that he delivers food on his bike and how fun it is because he just drives around. She was implying how good it would be for me because I needed to lose some weight after all. And, of course, I fucking did it. I did it for a few days and I gave up because I wasn't in shape to cycle all day around town and I felt horrible. 

I found myself a new job, working with people that I didn't like, everyone was pretending to like each other but talk shit behind their backs, they were rude, I had to wakeup at an ungodly hour just to work somewhere I couldn't stand. I was really miserable and it took a toll on my mental health. I quit recently, told her about it and she was just implying how I could've pushed through. I was contemplating suicide every day.

Yes, I sound weak as hell and yeah, I probably am. But, what do you think? Do you think I'm overreacting and I completely misread her intentions and she meant well? Or do you think I'm right and she was in some way manipulating or anything else?",relationship_advice
t3_dljjmj,Are phones a real problem?,"I started dating this girl in college for about a month and a half now and we really are kickin it really well.

I get it, sometimes we all have the impulse to check our phones due to an addiction i know deep down we all have. But I feel like when your with your boy/girlfriend you should at least try to use it a little less. But here's the thing. She keeps in contact with not just friends but family a lot aswell especially because her brother is in the military, so i decided to just let it be out of respect for her.

t3_dl1ic7,What do you redditors think of a prenup?,"With all the nasty stories of cheating and nasty divorces. This is 2019 a lot has changed since. 

I had a discussion with my girlfriend that I will soon be engaged with. I mentioned a prenup arrangement that she didn't take too well. 

She said she was happy to sign a prenup but felt like ""we are starting a relationship with no trust"".  I told her it's not a matter of trust but a matter of statistics that clearly indicate that over 50% of marriages end in a divorce. Out of those divorced they ALL were under the impression it was their soulmate that they were marrying. After all that is why we make vows to our SO. 

Another point she brought up was ""none of my siblings signed a prenup with their wives"". This is true my siblings all married distant relatives, that have strong family ties together. I told her that we met online and it takes time to build a trusting lasting relationship. What do you guys think?

I am 27M my girlfriend (soon to be fiance is 24)
This is a LDR.

EDIT: I have three properties and a portfolio of over 2million USD. She is unaware of what I own. I simply haven't mentioned my assets out of fear it will cloud her judgement in marrying me. I am mentioning this because a comment suggested we split everything 50/50 which is not a possible solution.

Edit 2: she just completed her studies and walking into this relationship with zero dollars. I mentioned to her that a prenup will help her as well in the event that she is a stay at home mother. We can have the lawyers iron out the details to what a 'stay at home mother' would be worth in 10 years. I am happy with her walking away with money in the event that it turns nasty. What I am not happy with is her walking away with half of my assets.

Edit 3: I think this post will help other people going through a similar problem; clear one of the biggest  issues in marriage (finances).

t3_dlfgmx,I feel like my fianc√© is pressuring me to have sex.,"I‚Äôm going to keep it vague because he uses reddit as well. (This is one of my alt accounts) 

So this has been happening for about 6 months. I (24f) and my fianc√© (26m) have been having some trouble in our sex life. At first it was wild, we were intimate many times a day but it went down hill from there because I was struggling with some mental health issues and started on antidepressants. Although the antidepressants work sometimes I‚Äôm just not really turned on anymore and when I am it‚Äôs rare. He has experienced frustration with this so I just started having sex with him whenever he asked even if I didn‚Äôt feel like it because I knew it was unfair to deny sex to him because of my issues. Well lately some things have come up with my therapist and we‚Äôre working on them but things have changed even more. Meaning that the majority of time I have sex I feel shame or guilt right after. I‚Äôve expressed to my fianc√© that I‚Äôve had trouble in the past with people who have touched me in a frightening and unsafe way and I‚Äôm trying to work on it, he will be understanding for about a day but he will soon go back to asking for sex until I give in. I didn‚Äôt want to be too graphic while saying I was working with my therapist but when I was about 4 and up into my teenage years I let people take little parts of my body and it has had an impact on my sense of safety and security. Tonight I had sex with my fianc√© because I had just gotten off my period and he kept asking if I was off my period yet. I feel like the only freedom I get is on my period. So after we were done he wanted another round and I said no. He kept saying please and I had to say no about 20 times. I‚Äôve expressed before that when he doesn‚Äôt respect my answer it makes my sense of safety with him diminish but he reverts to saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre never in the mood‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt get what that has to do with me saying no. Am I being selfish? What can I do?

Her husband and my wife do not go out to events often, so we often joke that we are going on ""married people dates"" without them. I have never approached her about this as I don't want to ruin the friendship but I do keep having dreams and thoughts about what it would be like to be in a relationship with her. 

This makes me feel like a jerk and gets me thinking I am a horrible person because I feel like I am emotionally cheating, however this person is one of my best friends and I don't want to lose that either.

t3_dkxf4q,Should I drop my therapist because she cried and divulged her religious preferences in my session?,"I am from the UK but live in Vietnam and had to confront the fact that I have some mental issues that need addressing. 

Thankfully, there is one qualified psychotherapist from America (relevant as I need someone who speaks fluent English), with a tonne of qualifications and plenty of years worth of experience. So I went ahead and booked a session with her.

Now I have never had therapy before so had no idea what to expect, and she seemed perfectly lovely. Asked pretty standard questions, nothing particularly deep, just about my life in general. I thought it might take more time/more sessions to get to the nitty gritty so booked a few more. 

The next session fell on a religious holiday and she happened to ask what my religious preferences were. I told her, and she began telling me how people need spirituity to have a purpose in life, and how she herself has aligned with several religions in her lifetime. I have no problem her telling me that, but she then progressed to tell me that Jesus is her guide and got quite emotional and started crying. 

I felt really uncomfortable and suddenly felt guilty talking about myself when the person I'm in the room with was visibly upset. 

Regardless, I don't have much choice with mental help here so booked another session with her a week later. She didn't cry or bring up religion again, but our conversations feel very much like general chit chat with not a lot of psychoanalysis going on. 

Like I say, I've never had therapy before so no idea if this is normal? Or if you have to stick it out a while to start getting to the analysis part? 

But most importantly I want to know if my concerns over unprofessionalism are valid? Are there any red flags here? Should I find another way to seek mental help as there aren't many options for English speakers here?

t3_dlfekd,GF (25F) is persistently mad at me (25M) for going on vacation too long with my younger brother (21M) which was planned 2 years (!) ago. I can't seem to change her mind.,"Throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, me and my brother always wanted to do this big vacation together, as brothers.

About 2 years ago we decided that we wanted to go to Nepal, however, later my brother suggested ""why not go to Japan in 2020 and combine it with the Olympics?"". I was thrilled, this was perfect as I'm very interested in Japanese culture.

As this is a very far away trip for us (from EU), we want to make the most out of it. This is a once in a lifetime vacation, so we wanted to go 6 weeks. Now, my gf first didn't approve, 6 weeks is too long. Later I explained to her, this is a once in a lifetime trip that we want to do as brothers before our lives get too serious and busy. She seemed to understand at a later stage and would do a trip to South-America with a friend of hers. Sure, seems fair, right?

As of lately she again claims 6 weeks is too long and wants me to go 4 weeks max. I (basically) ignored this, because I thought we already went through this and recently booked the flights for... yeah, 6 weeks.

I'm not exaggerating when I say she brings this up almost every week, saying she won't take into account my opinion anymore because I don't take her opinion into account by going 6 weeks. Am I being selfish here? We planned this in advance 2 years ago and no matter what I say she isn't cooling down. Whenever anyone says anything that is Japan related, everything starts over again. Saying that I'm going too long, that Japan is expensive and how are we going to pay for a new house when I'm going 6 weeks. It's getting exhausting and I don't know which arguments to give anymore to close this discussion for good.

Does anyone please have proper advice in this situation, or am I being the one that is selfish?",relationship_advice
t3_dlje3h,I (22M) am curious is this a sign to break up with my (21F) girlfriend?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years and everything has been relatively fine for the most part, we get along well and we don't really fight much. Shes finishing her last year of college and its extremely time consuming and I only see her once a week and we talk for maybe 30 minutes each day. This alone has been hard for me because I want to see her more but she's so busy I know its difficult. 

The reasons that we would fight is because we come from two different incomes, my family is wealthy and her family is in debt and is not able to pay bills efficiently. We've talked about money numerous times and every time it's always been an argument and we can just never agree on each others principles when it comes to dealing with money. I've lived by myself for 3 years now and she still lives at home to save money. 

Recently I've had the thought of breaking up with her because I just want to change my life, I love business and working and she just wants to be a teacher and get payed, which is amazing. The problem is that whenever I start to discuss what I want to do with my time and my business I can tell she thinks i'm like my father (He built company from ground up and is very successful) and I think she just thinks i'll be a conceded money grubbing person, but that's not true. I do enjoy working 16+ hour days and working towards a goal, but it always ends up with her just not caring with what I have to say.

I don't know, I'm typing this out and the hard thing is I love this girl more than anything, I mean we really get along well and I love when we are together. During the week when we don't see each other I have these thoughts but when I see her on Saturday(the one day we see each other) It feels that everything is amazing and we mesh so well together.

t3_dl562k,"Boyfriend (26) broke up with me (23) after he cheated, then I found out he lied about cheating","My ex and I were in a relationship for about a year and then things started to get rocky when he started law school. We went on a break (which I know is dumb, but I was (am?) In love). We got back together and he told that he slept with someone else while we were on a break. He said it was only once, he said it was at her house, he said it was a drunken mistake. His story didn't completely line but, but because I was so in love with him I said I wanted to work through it and we planned to move in with each other. Obviously things didn't work out, and I'm left looking for a place to live very last minute. I found out right before we broke up because I had snooped through his phone  (he broke up with me) that he slept with her 2 days before our break started. He had gone to her house, but those flirting/""I'm single"" texts started during the day in class, not at night where they would be drunk. Then she came to his house and slept over in his bed the next night. It feels like every part of his story he lied about. 

While we were breaking up all he could say was that he wanted to become a better partner for me and work on himself and that he can't do that when all he feels is guilt and that I've been the best relationship he's ever had and feels so bad for ruining it. 

I should also say that I think what triggered the break up (rather than working on things like we planned) was that I had called him out that his story didn't completely line up and that although I'm trusting and loyal, I am not an idiot (apparently I am because I still wanted to be with him and part of me still wants to be with him even though I know everything). I think he got nervous and realized he was in deep shit and realized the severity of what he did and that it can't be solved without some real reworking of himself. We left the break up saying that we loved each other and that we can be friends ( and really did mean it). The question is now that I've had a couple to think about things, my bitter side is coming out. Do I tell him I saw his phone and know he lied about everything or do I hold that to myself?

t3_dlelh2,We had a baby and she cheated.,"This is a long story but i remain torn and have no one to turn too. We started dating at around 15 years old and both took each other virginity. We were together for over three years. We had a child in june of 2017, At the beginning of this year i was banned from going to her parents house and was told someone said i was blackmailing her to stay with me by threatening to send her nudes to everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I never said anything like this and she is still telling me it will all blow over and too stay with her. She was telling me everyday she was going home to nap. It was weird seeing we had a daughter together and it's hard to sleep with such a young one.

She was inviting another man over and spending time with him telling her parents and everyone we had split up but still dragging me on. Then my friend approaches me who has been like a brother to me. Telling me all these rumors of her having sex with different guys. I try to hold the emotions back and talk to her like an adult and she denies it all. So i proceed to ask the first guy. Who is actually my ex brother and law who i still consider a brother. He tells me they did infact have sex. Then i call her and she denies it for upwards of 30 mins before finally admitting it. I scream and cuss and call her anything i could think of just trying to make her feel as i had felt before i decide im done with her.

&amp;#x200B;

A week goes by and i am at a party where i discover another person she had sex with. I was telling everyone my story seeking advice since she meant so much to me and we had built up and created a child. I tell everyone i don't know who all she cheated with but i had discovered she had another snapchat and was texting all kinds of guys and using dating apps such as ""hot or not"" then my friend of about a year admits what he had done feeling so guilty. He confirms everything and tells me all she did was talk shit about me before and after they had sex many times. He told me it bothered him to always hear about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I continue talking to her as i have no choice since we have a child together and i want to raise our daughter as i team. At this point she is with another guy and she cheats on him with me. It was exactly as my second friend had described all she did was talk shit about the new guy. Saying ""i needed your dick."" ""hes such a pussy.""  we  continued this for quite some time until he was next to her then found out. They stayed together and she blocked me on everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

until just the other day when i was using the restroom and she calls me. I was sitting on the toilet at the time and paniced and declined the call. i then text her asking what she needs. She says she is unhappy with the new guy and im always at the back of her mind. she got on her old snapchat and started sending me pictures of her exposed belly and just random things. She was leaving for a cruise when all this started and it lasted about five days of her talking to me and snapchatting me but now she is back. and once again blocked my nuymber she has only been back for a day. Through all of this knowing i don't use facebook very often she was posting about the other guy for public view but continuing to talk to me in private about not  being happy. She was contradicting herself she told me i am always on the back of her mind.

Today the spoilage advanced in a bad direction. Yesterday I was again stressed out, but it was because of the work, and because of the concerns that the girl will take up my time and I would not be able to finish the work. I have an immense amount of workload recently.

Today, I feel it with just imagining her. What's wrong? I like her when I think about it. I want to be comfy when thinking about her, but I cant. I know she is good, but I am unable to feel relieved about her.

I get this feeling when my mom sends me a message. I get it when my sister installs an application just to communicate me. I get it when the girl wants to study together. I get it when my ex communicates with me more than I would prefer.

It is not about every human. I dont remember myself getting this feeling with men (I am a hetero male).Is it about unwanted attention? I dont get this when I am presenting something.But when some particular women have their attention on me, I feel it.

I am in a study room, while writing this. There is a girl, that I dont know, sleeping on the desk while sitting on the chair. I look at her face, I do feel relief. She is not a threat for my subconscious. I guess it is because that I dont know her.

I desire women that do not seem like a threat. When I meet them, if they show an instant interest on me, or if they get into any kind emotional thing fast, I get stressed. The day before yesterday, the girl invited me to her house, I said no since I had work to do. After some time, we thought about playing backgammon, a board game. She came up with the idea that if she wins, I will come to her house. She made it a bet. There was nothing I could ask for, I made a token request of ten kisses, but I already was able to get it without the bet. There was nothing that I could claim from her, since I already got more than what I wanted. (Edit: I got instantly stressed out after she made it into a bet.)

I get comforted occasionally, for a few seconds, while I am writing this. Communicating the thoughts in any way helps. The stress comes back eventually, but in a weaker form, after I set pen to paper.

I've watched some ASMR videos throughout the past weeks. It helped me to desire women. When the person is inside a video, she is less of a threat for my sub-conscious, just as the girl sleeping on the desk.

It is like I am in a vacation, unable to enjoy it. I am discontent of this state of mine. I want to be able to enjoy life. What should I do?

TL;DR , I am having stress when women show excess interest on me, I don't have it when they are cool. I want to be less stressed, what are your suggestions?",relationship_advice
t3_dlgke6,Still in love with an old Boyfriend,"Hi guys! 

So, as the title says, I'm still madly in love with an old partner. We were together nearly two years but I ended things over 2 months ago because I freaked out over a serious relationship. 

I got into another, very bad, short term relationship with somebody and ended things fairly recently. He wasn't a nice person at all and throughout it I only thought of my Ex. 


Now I'm single, and I reached out to my ex and we met for coffee. It was so amazing to see him, but I really dont know if he'd even think of us trying again. 

What do I do?",relationship_advice
t3_dljb1c,Should I (28m) cut ties with my possibly cheating best friend (23m),"Sorry for the long story, but I could really use some thoughts or feedback before I possibly end a friendship.

My good friend (23M) moved in with an older roommate (37m) earlier this year.  Older roommate‚Äôs girlfriend (29f) starts coming over when my friend moves in.  He‚Äôs an attractive but shy and lonely guy.  I added roommate and girlfriend as social media friends over time.

My friend and the roommate GF start hanging out a lot ... and she basically lives there now.  I hear it all the time when we chat otp because I‚Äôm overseas.  My friend admitted he has attractions to her, but claims he would never hook up with her, out of respect for his roommate.

She also invites my friend out to drink a lot.  He never used to, but now he drinks with her like 6-7 days a week - mostly without the roommate.

My friend tells me not too long ago that his roommate‚Äôs relationship is hitting bottom.  I warn him not to be rebound, especially since he‚Äôs roommates with ‚Äúthem‚Äù now.  If he wants to date her, give some respect to his roommate and move out.  He gets defensive when I bring up the topic, so I drop it.

A few nights ago, they drunk video chat with me.  She‚Äôs pretty much on his bed (both clothed), he‚Äôs gaming.  When he steps out, she lays belly down on the bed, wants to start a long convo with me, but my friend comes back, pretty much on top of her, face to face, joking with us.

No kissing, but the visual is quite flirty and intimate, if you can imagine.

She pretty much passes out on his bed, even though her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù is asleep in the other room.  I don‚Äôt know much after, as they shut the video cam off with a good night.

This morning, I video chat my friend for a wake up call (he asked me.). He doesn‚Äôt pick up until late.  My friend and his roommate‚Äôs girlfriend are eating breakfast, bed head and all, still rather close (not too close though, more like shoulder to shoulder and flirty.)

My gut tells me something is going on.  Ive tried asking my friend about it but he gets really guarded - especially when I ask if anything is going on between him and his roommates GF.

Now, I know people will say - let it go - but I don‚Äôt want my friend to fall into rebound mode and get hurt.  And torn as to ‚Äúhow‚Äù to let it go, if I should.

More importantly, i don‚Äôt know if I can be friends with someone who would be so deceptive as to not only cheat with his roommate‚Äôs girlfriend, but lie to me. We used to share everything as closest friends.... and now I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll share my own personal stuff with this girl, or anyone, just to keep their attention.  I basically feel like I‚Äôm his tool, even though he‚Äôs been sweet talking me to stay as closest friends.

if he and his roommate‚Äôs girlfriend are hooking up, I‚Äôd also feel utterly horrible for his roommate.  I hear my friend and his roommate are moving out, but the girlfriend is not tagging along, of which she shared to me, she feels bad about.

Thoughts?  Besides letting go. Which is the plan.  I just need a strategy to do this, because as said, I‚Äôm like the only friend he literally claims he trusts and treasures.  I‚Äôd hate to drop him if I‚Äôm wrong in what I feel and see.

Are my friend and roommate GF hooking up?  If so, should I tell my friend exactly why I don‚Äôt feel comfortable being friends with someone who looks like he‚Äôs basically cheating with his roommate‚Äôs girlfriend, a girl who basically moved in to bang my friend, behind her boyfriend‚Äôs back?

Should I reach out to his roommate, see if he needs someone to talk to?

Should I even reach out to the girl, get her side of the story?

This is rather important to me, because my friend is very important to me ... but once I cut ties, it‚Äôll likely end the friendship for good.",relationship_advice
t3_dljae3,"Moved to be with a girl, not sure if I was lying to myself about our desired timelines lining up (me 29M) (her 31F)","Edit: Whoops that headline was a draft that I meant to edit, but I also kind of feel like I was ignoring the issue in the back of my mind and it's making me feel like a dick now. Oh well.

tl;dr:So I love this girl. I love her so much that I moved to a place with her where I have nobody but her. The problem is I'm realizing that there is a disparity between our timelines for when we want to settle down and have children, and that I might like to go back to being single. That said, I think there might be some overlap, but it's not really clear, and I'm wondering what's more worth keeping: the most fulfilling relationship I've ever been in but potentially having kids earlier than I imagined, or total freedom and all the fun and potential that comes with being single.

Longer version:I met a girl on Tinder and we got along great, living well as professionals in Portland, OR. I was a addicted to drugs at the time, to a drug called Kratom. She didn't like it but was generally cool about it (i.e. not much pressure, no ultimatum). I ended up seeing a therapist about it and quitting, although for the record we said 'I love you' before I ever even started talking about getting clean. Shortly afterwards she announced plans to move back to Virginia because of looming family issues I won't expand on but could empathize with. I didn't offer to follow but asked if she wanted to just date till she left, she did.

As her departure got closer, I started to realize there was nothing really keeping me in Portland, and I asked if she'd want me to follow her back to Virginia. She said she hadn't really considered it, but was open to it. She wasn't just moving because of that family thing, she was also moving because she didn't see a life for herself in Portland and wanted to move to a place she saw herself staying long term, buying a house, starting a family, etc. She wants to have kids before 35. Now, I always saw myself having kids but didn't really see that until my late 30s, figuring as a dude I'd probably be the older one in the relationship so it'd work out. So we talked about it and decided, we'll spend some time apart, I'll visit her in Virginia, we'll see how it feels, and then we'll decide.

So a few weeks go by and I visit her, we have a really great time, I love her as much as I remember, her friends are super cool and nice and inviting, her life in Virignia seems super chill and extremely attractive to me. We talk about it and we both decide we'd be happy if I moved. Things have been going great since, my job let me work remotely and I've been here for a couple months now. However we talked recently and it's becoming clear that if we want two kids (both before she's 35) then we have to start pumping them out within like.. 3 years? I *seriously* don't know if I'm ready for that. Add this to the fact that while I truly believe I'm fully in love with my girlfriend, I also really had a great time being single and partying, even though I know I had bad habits, and honestly would not even mind going back to that. Yes, I've considered that I've got residual biases from my past addiction.

Does anybody know of a reliable method for making up my mind?",relationship_advice

t3_dlj8nv,Friend (25F) Got Into Relationship and Has Stopped Hanging Out Entirely With Me (M25),"Hi everyone!

So, long story short: been friends with this girl since high school and we even went to prom together. We weren't friends in college and she lived across the country, but I moved to the same city two years ago and we were quickly close friends again, talked all the time, and saw each other once a week or so. We were very close and she meant a lot to me! When I moved to my current city, she had just gotten out of a relationship and lamented how she felt she didn't spend enough time with her friends during the relationship and regretted that.

Fast forward. Back in March, she got into a relationship. Since then, she has not asked me to hang out a single time. Not even for a happy hour. I've seen her one time since March (in July) and that was when I invited her over. And it just felt different, she was very distant. All this time she still texts me about things, as if everything is normal, and I act normal. I'm a grown ass man and I'm not going to act like a child or throw a fit.  I act like nothing is wrong. But I do feel abandoned. Some things you can't ever forgive and when you're in a relatively new city and don't have a lot of friends and your close friend effectively makes no effort to hang with you or see you in the span of like seven months, it makes you resentful. Fights happen between friends, you disagree on things, but when someone proves they don't value you, that's kind of the end of it. What's the point of being friends with someone who you are basically not friends with the second they are in a relationship?

The ""mature"" side of me wants to just not say anything and let things just be the way they are, but the other part of me wants to send her something about how I feel, how it has hurt me, etc. What would you do?",relationship_advice

t3_dlf926,I‚Äôm falling for my best friend who is an ex of one of my closest friends and who is also best friends/roommates with my ex.,"Sorry for the long post but I‚Äôm on mobile and this is an accumulation of 3 years worth of backstory.

I (22M) met 2 girls (21) my freshman year of college at a weekend long freshman orientation. We‚Äôll call them Claire (ex) and Maya (best friend). They are basically family to each other. They‚Äôre both extremely attractive and becoming friends with them was really easy. While at this orientation, my good friend (Tony) thought they were both attractive as well so we joked about both dating one. As the weekend ended I gravitated towards Claire and he towards Maya. 

Over the next couple of months Tony and I would go over to the girl‚Äôs apartment almost every day and spend hours over there. While both sets of friends started flings with their respective others, things started getting complicated. Even though Claire would tell me things like I‚Äôve been the most serious relationship she‚Äôs had and she‚Äôs never get more comfortable with me than anyone, fights involving commitment, sexual tension, trust, security, religion, and timing would start popping up, and the girls would eventually split with us guys the following semester due to religious disagreements.

The next couple of months were treacherous. I stopped eating, going to class, and I dropped out university to go to community college at home, and for the next 2 years I had an on and off relationship with Claire. Tony and Maya were on and off for about a year and a half, breaking up due to Tony wanting to date other people, however then regretting it. After that Tony left our group but him and I are still good friends. I was still close to uni so I would find consolation in Maya about Claire and my issues surrounding that. Each time Claire and I tried, the same problems kept arising. This involves emotional drunk breakdowns at concerts, late night talks until 5 am concerning where we are and how we feel and just trying to make it work until it would kill us. However it didn‚Äôt last. Towards the end I was losing patience and with Claire not committing I was just about done. 

Then this past New Years Claire, Maya and I all get drunk at their apartment and Claire and I end up being affectionate on her couch. The next couple of days however would end with her telling me it was a mistake and even though she still had feelings it was wrong. I respected her honesty but after that it‚Äôs like the switch just turned off inside me and I haven‚Äôt looked back or felt anything since.

Claire and I didn‚Äôt talk for a couple months after that but still hung out occasionally and then progressively often. I‚Äôm very sentimental and have friendships with all my exes. I don‚Äôt like cutting people out.

However from this past January to now, Maya and I have become incredibly close. We‚Äôve gone on a vacation (just us) to my childhood vacation spot which I‚Äôve never taken any girl or girlfriend to. Since that trip I‚Äôve acknowledged my definitive feelings for her. She described the trip as ‚Äúactually perfect‚Äù and since then we‚Äôve been hanging out more than ever. She‚Äôs for sure my best friend in the whole world. She makes time to come visit with me, sometimes multiple times a week and when we do she usually spends the night in my bed and we talk the entire time. I gave her a key to my apartment. We‚Äôve bawled our eyes out over exes together, pulled all nighters talking,gotten shitfaced together and taken care of the hangover aftermath with each other.  We have seen each other at our worst. We text each other all the time that we love and miss each other. Everyone says it‚Äôs super obvious how we act around each other and there‚Äôs no way AT LEAST one of us feels a type of way (guilty) but I just see from a different angle. In terms of conversation and how much we hang out i can see how the romantic puzzle pieces fit but I feel like heterosexual friendships are always looked at with rose tinted glasses. in terms of requited love I try to be pessimistic so I don‚Äôt get let down, and by trying not to read into things I‚Äôve concluded that just with Mayas body language it doesn‚Äôt seem flirty to me, just very friendly and familiar. We have never kissed or done anything explicitly/intentionally romantic. Just the standard hugging and physical contact that friends share. 

Another angle is Claire constantly getting jealous of the time we spend together. She is always texting Maya when we are hanging out and tries to tag along sometime but Maya and I just go with our plan and stick to our duo. Even when we‚Äôre all 3 sitting, Claire will get uncomfortable if maya and I are too friendly, be it joking or just talking. It‚Äôs hard to tell if she is possessive of me her ex, or Maya her best friend. Claire straight up makes jokes about Maya and I getting married and being intimate but you can feel her discomfort when she says it. 

My main dilemma is deciding to tell Maya or not how I feel. I truly am on the fence about if she feels the same way and she is constantly shooting her other guy friends down who have feelings for her and then telling me how much she hates doing it. I hate getting shot down and I‚Äôd hate to have to make her do that to me. Her friendship means 100‚Äôs of times more to me than my romantic feelings. Worst case scenario is I tell her and we stop hanging out as much and grow distant while also probably launching Claire into a fit of jealous disdain for my feelings, ruining both friendships. Best case scenario is she reciprocates, however certainly destroying her friendship with Claire. I care about both of them so much but I don‚Äôt know if I should express how I feel or not. I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. I‚Äôve been holding onto these feelings for 5 months and still haven‚Äôt said something. Please weigh in any advice it will be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice

t3_dlgekd,Am I an idiot or a jackass or both?,"Wait! I know this sounds like an AITA post but I need advice.

 About 6 months ago myself (16M) moves school due to genuinely hating life at my other school, had no friends and genuinely wanted (and occasionally did) want to fight everyone around me.

After moving to my new school and finding my clique of friends, I genuinely started to enjoy what I was doing again, I‚Äôve started going out more, spending much less time on video games, and genuinely having reasons to get out bed in the mornings other than to eat.

My problem comes in here, one of my friends (16f) and me started getting kinda close and the rest of our friends started noticing, before I even notified how much I enjoyed spending time with her...
They asked me whether I liked her the day after I figured it out.
Problem comes In here, she‚Äôs been sorta into this new guy despite sending me ‚Äúsignals‚Äù (others terminology, not mine, I was low key oblivious af until recently) IE at the party I threw at mine last weekend she sat on my lap and spooned me at one point in front of everyone, which I was kinda questioning internally but certainly wasn‚Äôt complaining.

Everyone else picked up on it and a few of my guy friends who crashed started asking me about it and kinda got it in my head to ask her out, after talking to everyone plus her best friend they all said I should do it..... 
apart from the fact that her best friend later messaged me last night and said that I shouldn‚Äôt ask her out as she said she wouldn‚Äôt say yes; I was a bit blindsided and a bit miffed to be honest but sorta accepted it.

So today as I knew she knew that I wanted to ask her out, my idiot arse decided that I might as well tell her that I won‚Äôt ask her out and I‚Äôll just stay friends with her.

I'm 18 and female, my mother makes my depression worse, and i want to move out or move in with my dad, but I'm still in highschool so she refuses to allow me to move.

I've depression in general (not suicidal kind, i just don't feel well.) With everything my mom says to me it makes me suicidal.

I'm not doing well in school because my depression is effecting me that much and my antidepressants only made it even worse so i stopped taking them (i feel better without them actually).

And my mom originally all against them yelled at me for it and made me feel like im a horrible person for it, but they made me more suicidal.

Because im not doing well in school and i don't even want to get out of bed my mom thinks i want to drop out of school. I don't. I just want a break until i feel better.

Some of the things she's said to me-
""Is school too hard for you? Do you think you'd be better off as a dropout??""

""Do you want to drop out and commit suicide in 4 years because no one will hire you?""

""You better start dressing up and having better hygiene and wearing makeup to attract a rich man, since you won't be able to support your dropout self. You should also erase all opinions you have since you'll have to serve him.""

""All your friends will leave you. No one will want to take care of you forever.""

I want to move in with my dad because he isnt as toxic as my mother. She almost drove my twin brother to suicide (he's attempted multiple times), thats why he lives with my dad now. He's triving and doing really well and getting the care and love he deserves.

But nonetheless I‚Äôll give it a shot as I‚Äôm desperate now.

We‚Äôve been dating for 10 months now, known each other for 3 years though. He was my manager at my old job and we had tension but it nothing came from it  until this year. At the beginning things were great between us, I seen him stare at other and since we were in the honeymoon phase I was able to write it off for a few months and move on.
But then I started getting hurt by it, it crept it‚Äôs way into my mind at night and while we were on dates and I happened to see him starting at a women it wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind for the rest of the night. I noticed he had a specific ‚Äúfancy‚Äù for Asian women. I‚Äôm a white women nothing like them, I started comparing myself. Knowing I could never be like that. 
We live in Iowa on the eastern half and we happen to have a heavy population of people from Asia. I felt outnumbered and like he still wanted something else that I wasn‚Äôt so I wondered why he was with me.

He mention he wanted to go to the gym and right away I wanted to say no because I knew what would happen he would be starting at other women and I would see and I was dreading it. One night we were in front of the mirrors and there was a women in front of us who he started at the WHOLE workout which was 1 hour long. I couldn‚Äôt believe he had done it for so long when he had to know I would see? I brought it up to him for the first time and everything else followed with all the insecurities about not being his type and the Asian women and what I had just seen. His response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know remember do that, I don‚Äôt remember starting at a girl in there. Which girl was it? I can‚Äôt even remember‚Äù

This has since then been his response to it every time. 

We were out eating food and  when we were getting ready to leave he followed this girls ass which his head and essentially rubbernecked her. I was SO taken aback by that. It was extremely obvious and the girl‚Äôs boyfriend had seen him do it and made immediate eye contact with me. My boyfriend got up to refill his drink and I was left watching the boyfriend tell the girl and see them both look at me to mouth ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok‚Äù. But the girl looked clearly uncomfortable. My face was burning, I was embarrassed and hurt and I couldn‚Äôt take it. I blew up in the car on him because he said again that he didn‚Äôt remember.  I was so embarrassed from that I was so hurt and it felt like he didn‚Äôt care and never cared to stop at least in front of me. This was a few months ago many 2 and I thought it was done until yesterday.

I went to go see him at lunch at his work and everything was fine until I seen an Asian girl walk in and sit behind me right in his view. I tried to ignore the thoughts of maybe he is looking, the thoughts of comparing myself again I tried to fight them off. But I turned around to look at the tv and when I turned back my boyfriend snapped his neck back into place faster than seemed normal. It seemed abrupt and like he had been caught doing something bad. I knew him and I knew it was normal to move like that. I just said ‚Äúwere you starring‚Äù and he replied with a no. I dug alittle deeper and asked him what was on the tv and he said he didn‚Äôt know he just seen something interesting.
 
These thoughts seem dumb, and brought out of my own insecurities. But what he is doing is making me insecure and hurt. He can‚Äôt even try to not stare? I feel crazy when it happens because all he says is he doesn‚Äôt remember doing it. So did it even happen or am I making these up? 
I don‚Äôt mind him looking just not around me and I‚Äôve told him that. But that hasn‚Äôt helped. Whenever I say it and we go out I feel the tension between us when an  attractive women walks by us or is near, the conversation falls short. I don‚Äôt want it to be that way.. I don‚Äôt want him to feel restricted because of my feelings. I just don‚Äôt want to see it anymore. 

I don‚Äôt know what to say to him at this point, or to ask of him. Please help.",relationship_advice
t3_dlgbnu,Friend can't cut off toxic other friend,"Hey r/relationship_advice,

I have a friend A who was treated horribly by an ex-friend B of hers a few months ago (long story and not directly relevant to this thread) and ever since then A has been trying to cut B off. I see this to be a good thing since they both clearly dislike each other and talk shit about each other behind each others back. Yet when they see each other occasionally, they pretend like nothing is wrong. In addition to this, A has an almost obsession with B, talking about how much she dislikes her and how much the situation a few months ago hurt her and continuing to check out B's social medias were B publicly talks badly about A (just without mentioning A's direct name). I thougt this would be a thing that A would let go after a a week or two, but it's been nearly a year and the situation hasn't changed, in spite of A telling me B is officially cut off now on a near weekly basis. How can I help A resolve this situation/ support A in this?

t3_dlf4o4,My M(25) anxiety/poor communication skills has cost me my relationship with my ex fiance (F21). I always struggled with communicating to her and it lead me down a bad path.,"Backstory, We've been together for whatbwould have been 2 years. I'm not in the US atm, I'm studying in the EU and with a limited income so I cant talk to anybody at home and when I do it was never for long what with me being 7 hours ahead compared to back home. When we landed, about a week in I was terribly anxious, stressed and homesick. I was told this is natural and I told my fiance how I felt, she was always reassuring me that it's only 3 months and we are already Long distance and I'll be back before I know it. 

Cut to me getting to my home stay after the orientation, we arrived early September and it the month was almost over. At this point we've hardly spoken at all (shitty wifi) and I'd have to wait till 3 or 4am to speak to anybody. I couldn't do it most of the time. Which made my feelings even worse...so I looked to blogs and threads to maybe help me. Long story short, some anon account dms me. Ok whatever. Tells me how funny some of my memes are, I thank them. 

As the convo continues this person starts to ask if I'm in a relationship and other personal info. I tell them no (safe bet right?). 

Anyway I fell for something, this person claiming to be from the UK starts flirting hardcore, and since this is the only form of human contact I've felt Ive had (host family doesnt speak English well so yea, you tend to feel isloated) in forever. It was casual at first but they initiated sexting. In the moment I just sort of went with it...I craved any sort of contact so if it was this kind ok sure. Later we end the convo, say goodnight and guess who calls from snapchat seconds after?

More background, this anon account has only been up for 11 days that this point so I'm an idiot for not looking into it. But this person somehow sent our convo to my fiance. And she is understandably livid, we broke up because of this and while we had some barriers with me being unable to communicate in the past, and while this is clearly on me. I cant shake this feeling that theres more to this or am I being paranoid? 

What I did was wrong, but...I was able to at least find the IP of this anon account and it was based in the US, not from the UK where this person claimed to be. What do I make of this?",relationship_advice
t3_dliyxr,Help me do things things right.,"I've been in a relationship with a girl for a bit more than 3 years now, last week we had a really bad argument because she was drinking when partying with her friends. She's done some things in the past which ended up on her promising not to drink again when partying, cause it makes me doubt those bad things could happen again.
I've been a really controlling boyfriend, she's been pressured by me on a lot of things, such as partying, posting photos on social media and that kind of stuff; in a possessive way.
After our argument last week, we stopped talking, I went to the psychologist and I've decided that I need and want to change, in every way. I've been trying meditation which kinda helped me, I really want to stop being possessive, I've suffered every time she went out partying and I need to stop that, for both of us.
I've managed to stop worrying about some stuff but I'm afraid it will all come back and I'm gonna be the same duche I was before. How can I improve?",relationship_advice

t3_dlixtc,confused whether my ex wants to see me again. need help asap,"so i started seeing this girl near the beginning of february, and she had a boyfriend at the time but broke up with him shortly after and we became exclusive until the june, when things started to get rocky in our relationship. we were arguing a lot part of it was because i was a bit insecure about myself and it started to make me jealous of the people in her life, and i started getting possessive and she totally called me out on it and but part of it was her as well because wouldn't want to see things in my perspective, but anyway things got bad and we ended up taking a break i guess but it was more of a breakup because we didnt talk at all for like two months. i started understanding some of the things that i was doing wrong and i wanted to change because of it so i tried to gain more confidence in myself but i realized i needed closure because i wouldn't be able to move on as a person if i still thought she hated my guts, so i texted her and told her all this and asked to meet. so we met at this local coffee shop and talked for some time about what happened the last few months and then she asked if we could talk somewhere private (immediately i thought we were going to have sex) so i took her to my apartment and we talked for a while there as well, and she told me she was trying to become a better version of herself because she didn't like the person she was before and she didnt want to be with someone until she was comfortable sharing the version of herself she wants to be, so i told her i would a lifetime for her and i meant it because i really want it to work and we talked for a while more after that and before i knew what i was doing, we were kissing on my bed and stuff, but before we got any further she stopped me and said she didn't want this to happen and i told her we could stop but she went to the bathroom and i started putting my clothes back on and then she just left without another word. i tried going after her but she wouldn't talk to me so i gave up. i got kind of inebriated after that but anyway i just went to the bathroom and found out she left two hairclips here, i knew they're hers because they smell like her, and i mean this means she wants to see me again right, or did i just mess it all up again?",relationship_advice
t3_dliwxd,My (25M) fiance (24F) could leave me if I can't have a wedding this summer and I dont know what to do.,"Alright so a bit of a background, my fiance and I met 5 years ago when we were both studying in the same university. We hit it off and started dating in June 2015, I graduated in 2016 and she graduated a year later in 2017. She doesn't live in the same country as me so once she graduated she had to leave and we started a long distance relationship, we're both Arab Muslims and her family is quite traditional so that on top of the struggles of a long distance relationship pushed us towards getting engaged in October 2018. The engagement made things a lot easier as I could now freely visit her every few months which would make long distance a bit more manageable, however obviously once we're engaged it's with the idea that we would be planning a wedding soon. I have a steady job with a decent salary and over the past couple of years of working I've managed to save up a decent amount of money, however anyone who's gotten married would know that weddings are expensive and life after marriage is even more difficult with all the expenses and bills and general costs of living that will undoubtedly come our way. Initially we had planned on a wedding sometime around November/December 2019 but soemtime around March I realized that it just wasn't financially feasible for me and I'd need more time. This initial delay caused quite a bit of tension between my fiance and I and there were lots of tears and fights but in the end she relented and we postponed our plans to a June 2020 wedding. Now the issue at hand is that it's almost November and with our wedding supposedly 8 months away I have once again done my calculations and it's clear that I would either be unable to afford the wedding or I would just about be able to pay for it but go into married life without a single penny to my name as everything would be sunk into the wedding and all the other associated costs. I discussed this with my fiance and showed her the calculations I've done and why I think we would need to delay a little while more, she found this unacceptable and stated that she can't do long distance anymore and cant handle the stress and problems associated with it and if the wedding cant be done in June 2020 then she would have to reconsider the relationship and possibly end things. My fiance isn't a bad person nor is she manipulative by nature, I've known her for 5 years and she is honestly one of the kindest and sweetest people I've ever met. She struggles with anxiety and depression and she also doesnt have the easiest family life and so these things on top of the difficulty of a long distance relationship have all weighed her down and contributed to her eagerness to get married as soon as possible she can leave her family life and come be with me, unfortunately while I do understand her reasoning this isnt an emotional decision it's a financial one and I genuinely dont see how I can afford a wedding at this point and I do feel like I need more time, at the same time I don't want to lose her and I'm scared that that could possibly happen if I do delay once again. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no clue what to do so I've come to you reddit for an objective outsider view.

t3_dliu8j,I occasionally have anger attacks towards my bf &amp; i need advice,"So i (20F) am in a 2.5 year relationship with my boyfriend (28M). We really love each other, have fun and do fun things very often. We‚Äôre really nice to each other and always happy to see each other again (we live like 45 minutes apart). We never fight and he is really patient with me all the time. Everything about the relationship is fine, except for my behavior sometimes. It has happened around 5 times during our relationships that i got really mad at him, for pretty much nothing. For some reason it always has to do with going out partying at night. An example: he went out with his friends until 8am without me knowing it. I got really really mad and called him an asshole. Around that time i was having issues with my social life and i found it hard to go out partying at night, so i was pissed that he managed to go out until 8am without me, because it never seemed to succeed with me. 

So now, a year later, i am pretty much over the going out partying thing, because i have discovered it‚Äôs not really for me. So now i only do it once every few months. This past weekend me, my bf and a few of his friends went out. I got really drunk, and when my bf  took away my drinks to prevent me from getting even more drunk and throwing up, i got mad, ran to a corner and started crying. I expected him to come up to me but he didn‚Äôt. So i agressively give him the finger. The rest of the night i just cried my eyes out while a friend of my bf tried to comfort me. I was constantly looking for attention and guilt from my bf. He and this friend got me an Uber to my bf‚Äôs home, and my bf cried (he never cries) because he found it very hard to send me home alone.

Maybe it doesn‚Äôt sound that bad, but the problem is that i just sometimes try to make him feel guilty for when i‚Äôm feeling bad. 

My bf said he is really done with this shit  and can‚Äôt deal with it anymore. I fully understand him and i am fully aware of my bullshit childish behavior. I promised him i am going to get therapy (i already did once but it wasn‚Äôt really a match between me and my therapist) He now wants his space and doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me until the weekend.

t3_dliu75,My [30/F] life partner is suggesting i look for other people to fill the intimacy gap. Need some outside perspective,"So my life partner is really wonderful in alot of ways but struggles with some mental/emotional issues and PTSD. we've been working on things to help her and us as a couple since we got serious 4 years ago, but there are often times where i dont get the intimacy and closeness that i really need/crave( not just sexually) I dont pressure her and do my best to help her not feel badly about it but there are times it really bums me out and makes me feel insecure.

We have had many conversations over the years about what is best for her and how we both feel related to this stuff and she has multiple times expressed that she would be fine with me being more intimate with other people as long as fully disclose and im still prioritizing her.
She says she would feel nothing about me having sex with another women. she says that sex doesnt matter to her. I explained i feel the opposite and it would crush me if she was with another person that way. she says thats fine and she doesnt want anyone else anyway.

So im considering this one sided open relationship thing but i really dont want to ruin what i have with her and i defiantly dont want to hurt her if her feelings change. but at the same time im feeling pretty isolated and strongly considering her offer.

What do you guys think? is this a disaster waiting to happen or is it the start of a wonderful thing?  would love to hear from people in similar situations.

It's hard to end it right now because of the following.

1. Her father was recently diagnosed with cancer and its getting pretty ugly.
2. We have a vacation planned with my family that costs around 4k$ which is in december/january. (basically planned to celebrate christmas and new years eve in my home country with the rest of my family). 
3. We share the same friends
4. Her family loves me and my family loves her.
5. I'm not sure she will be able to make rent
6. She loves me so much, I'm afraid that if I end it with her now, she won't be able to get through with everything that is going on.

t3_dlitrw,Best Friend is Getting Married Soon and Keeps Cheating on her Fianc√©,"My best friend (Miranda 22) came to America during high school on a Visa. She met her now fianc√© (Jim 20) during college so around a year ago. They haven‚Äôt had any issues until more recently. Her Visa is about to expire and he proposed. Wedding date is in early spring. 

She had been telling me that she developed a crush on someone that she saw at the gym a few times and I told her to steer clear (he basically was a clone of her longtime ex). A few weeks later, she calls me and tells me she slept with him. I told her that she needs to tell Jim immediately, but she refused because she said it would break his heart (even though she never considered that when she slept with the guy in the first place) and how if he decided to end the engagement/call off the wedding, she would end up having to go back to her home country where it would then take a long time to come back over. I have repeatedly told her she needs to talk to him, but she refuses every time. 

She went out another night and got piss drunk and told me she gave a random man oral in a bathroom stall. Again, I told her she needs to call off the wedding if she isn‚Äôt sure and needs to tell Jim. She refused and said the same things. I went to spend the weekend with her recently and her behavior just isn‚Äôt acceptable for someone who is getting married (she was watching male workout videos to see if she could see a guy‚Äôs bulge, asking if a coworker I hung out with was hot, etc). She said she was sure about this marriage. However, her friend told me that she had cheated on her fianc√© three times, not just the two Miranda told me about (so at this point idk who to believe).

The thing is, I‚Äôm not friends with her fianc√©. I didn‚Äôt think the wedding was a good idea even before the cheating. I think he is very immature and has his own issues. Both clearly know it‚Äôs being rushed because of the green card. 

I talked to my boyfriend about this recently and he thinks I need to give her an ultimatum. Either she tells him or I do. The problem is, I think it‚Äôs best from her/im not friends with her so if he asks me questions, I don‚Äôt want to be involved (also regardless I‚Äôm getting involved in something by telling him). The other issue is that this isn‚Äôt just a matter of the marriage gets called off and they just continue normalish lives. My friend will ultimately get deported if she doesn‚Äôt get married. Granted, she should gave some sort of repercussions for her actions (she knows I hate the idea of cheating). It‚Äôs more weird to me that there was never any cheating until the engagement. I keep pressing to hold off on the wedding and tell him. I think he completely deserves to know, but I don‚Äôt want to be involved and tell him.

t3_dlg6ei,I‚Äôm (F27) worried bf (28) is not getting enough attention,"We‚Äôve been dating close to 2 years now and I love him so much; I can see him as a life long partner and I genuinely feel he is the one. He tells me he feels the same way but I feel that I do not give him the attention he needs and I think I am ruining our relationship.

First of all, ever since I‚Äôve been on birth control, I felt almost no need for sex. I used to love sex, but now nothing arouses me. I literally have no drive at all. I am planning getting off the pill after this month to see if this is the cause since I‚Äôve heard BCP can affect this.

Second, my job is extremely demanding. I have just acquired my first ‚Äúlead‚Äù position as an artist and I am trying to grow my career and experience in order to become an art director and get better gigs. It‚Äôs a start up though, so unpaid overtime (I‚Äôm salaried) is encouraged. However, I‚Äôm often loaded with tons of tasks and long hours with my boss(es) messaging me on weekends and early mornings. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have to deal with a few really incompetent/toxic coworkers. One of the more egregious ones recently saw his way out the door, so hopefully my stress will improve.

Third, I‚Äôve been insecure about my weight gain. I‚Äôm not obese but I feel my body looks extremely embarrassing from what it used to be. The stress and exhaustion often leads to me ordering in food for me and my partner because I‚Äôm too tired to make anything for us. I would love if my bf was more proactive about cooking healthy meals but he really hates to cook I think. He is unhappy about his own weight gain as well, so it‚Äôs often up to me to make healthy meals that doesn‚Äôt taste like cardboard. Ordering in healthy food is just hard to do; we both cave into what we crave. Especially when I‚Äôm as exhausted and stressed as I usually am.

Last, is kind of silly, but his hygiene... it just... wasn‚Äôt the greatest. But as soon as I had the balls to finally admit this to him he is making a lot of effort to improve his problem areas.

My bf is so loving and gives me a lot of attention but I‚Äôm often stressed and exhausted and can barely reciprocate. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have sensitive skin and I get itchy and overheat super easily. (Partly because his scruff irritates my skin and also because I break out in a nasty rash randomly... I‚Äôve seen doctors but they give me the run around and can‚Äôt seem to figure out why my skin is the way it is)

It almost is the perfect recipe to make him think that I don‚Äôt care for his affections. Which was exactly what I feared and I was right, he felt neglected and unwanted. Even though I thoroughly explain all this to him it obviously doesn‚Äôt mean it makes him feel much better. This also adds to my anxiety and stress...

I know all I can do is wait and see if there is improvement in any of the more major areas and try to keep healthy. But I just feel like I need more help. However I feel like I already am demanding too much of my boyfriend; I‚Äôm already asking him to change his hygiene habits, asking him to cook more, arrange dates for us and making him wait and be patient with me for sex.

I just don‚Äôt know much more of what I can do except hope my situation improves and that my bf won‚Äôt dump me before then. I feel so angry at myself, I just wish I didn‚Äôt need to struggle so much in everything.

Tl;dr I love my bf to death, but due to zero libido, skin issues, fatigue, self esteem and extreme stress, I can‚Äôt give him all the attention and physical intimacy that I want to. Stresses me out even more that he feels neglected because it‚Äôs not his fault.",relationship_advice
t3_dlirdk,I (F23) have been unsuccessfully in love for 4 years. Make it stop.,"First time poster here. I don't know what to do. I've been in love with the same guy (25) since the day we met 4 years ago. We became really good friends even though I was in a relationship back then. We had and still have the same circle of friends. We soon realized that our liking was mutual and since I've not been happy with my then bf, I broke it off with the then bf. 

Guy and me wanted to take it slow and started dating which wasn't really successfull since we have both been hurt and haven't yet healed from it and we were confused. It was almost a year of not being together but wanting to on both sides before he went back to his ex. I started dating others while also becoming more hateful towards Guy. I've never resented someone so much for what he has done to me. (There was some overstepping boundaries.) I guess there really is a small line between love and hate

Fast forward to now. I've been in a 2 year relationship that isn't going nowhere and I'm about to break it off again. Guy broke up with his gf years ago. The hate towards Guy has been gone for a few months, thankfully. We did have some conversations about our past and he apologized multiple times a year ago. It took me so long to deal with my hurting. We started to treat each other kindlier again. Just basics like not ignoring each other and actually saying Hi. But I also felt the liking part reappear on my side. Last week we've accidentally been on the same party, chatting all night to the point of people assuming we were together. He made sure I got home safe and paid for my subway ticket. 

We met up to talk a day later but it felt awkward. He assumed I was single but I told him the truth about planning on a breakup. He also didn't contact me since then. 

I don't know what I'm going to do with my feelings. I know it's stupid to think I can trust him or that this is going anywhere but friendship but I have also never loved someone this much. How do I stop loving someone? Does it make sense to keep talking to him when I'm only going to fall in love with him more than I am now? Because I know that this will happen if I keep this up.   
I feel like a whiny teenager, I'm sorry. But my head isn't thinking straight. It feels like I just can't keep away from him.

t3_dlez9k,My[24f] boyfriend[25m] has been looking at r/ddlg and I'm confused,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years and have been living together for 2. We are very happy together, get along really well and rarely have arguments now. It hasn't always been like that, we went through some rough patches but we are in a good place now and have been for a while. 


The other day I was scrolling through reddit on his phone, this isn't unusual, he was in the same room and was aware that I was on his phone. I went to search something and the search history came up showing r/ddlg. I know what that is but don't know completely what it involves and it has freaked me out quite a lot. 


Now I just want to say that I'm not judging people who are into that, as long as it's consenting adults, it really doesnt bother me what people are into. But I have to admit it hasn't sat quite right with me, I get wanting to be a dom/sub and I could even get the ""daddy"" bit but ""little girl"" just seems creepy. I think what freaked me out as well was the fact that I had no idea he was into that, we have been open about other fetishes with each other and have explored them, so why hide this one? Over the last year or so we haven't had sex as often as usual, we've spoken openly about this with each other and have both said our sex drive has decreased for various reasons (medication/stress related) but are still happy together and still make an effort. I guess I just didnt expect him be looking at stuff like that but not wanting to talk to me about it. But then maybe I'm expecting too much and overreacting.


I suffer from anxiety so it's sometimes hard to see things clearly, even as I'm writing this I feel silly. This has set my anxiety off quite badly, I've been reserved and my bf has noticed this and has asked what's wrong but I cant bring myself to tell him. I dont want to embarrass him, I dont want him to be angry, I'm just a bit scared about his reaction or scared to ask because I dont know what it means. I may just need a reality check as maybe this is all totally normal but I just need an outside opinion because my head is all over the place right now.",relationship_advice

I am (m28) and started seeing a (f26) roughly 2-3 months ago. We met at work and instantly hit it off. I don't see her very often because I work on the tools and she is in the office. After texting for a couple of weeks it all came out that she head hunted me for the job because she fancied me, she ended it with another guy she had been seeing a little while and that was that.

We've been texting almost daily since about a week after I started and things were going great, we each said a few things that were a bit too quick to come out, such as living together and marriage, both were a little tongue in cheek but still not something that should be said that soon even then. I have said things myself that maybe a little strong for so early, telling her the reasons that I like her and that I think of her all the time, to which she would reply ""why are you so in love with me?"", I do think of our future, but I'm not in love with her, but I really want to be. She says cute things like ""I miss you, and you are worth the world"" to name a couple. However, she has a lot of things going on right now, a house renovation and family trouble and has recently suggested we take a little break until she gets her stuff sorted. We expect to have this last around a month, maybe a little more.

Texting her makes me really happy, and I miss it after only 2 days. She says she ignores my messages for a while sometimes because she was trying to turn it off to deal with her stress for a while. But to me, I would want to be talking to the other person to destress, and see that person for a little while to forget about everything else.

Now I find myself checking when she has been online, because I think it's me putting her off and she is texting someone else. (the times between her being online from when we were texting to now haven't really changed, she is online quite often). She said she wanted us to start a relationship perfect and while this is going on is far from that. I've had the seeds of doubt and paranoia sewn in to me from an ex girlfriend and it hurts my head.

Am I being paranoid and should I just try my best to not think about it until she is ready, or should I ask her if I'm putting her off and if there is anything I can do?

I realise I sound a bit stalkery, but I can really see myself with this girl because she is everything I want, and I just want to be in a position with her where I can find out if she really is that girl.

t3_dlg3u1,I (26M) have started developing feelings towards to one of my best friends.,"I've known my friend (22F) for a while now, and we've been on good terms. While I'm from North America who moved overseas, she lived her entire life here in Asia.

We discussed a lot about our personal lives and our struggles, and we both were there for each other when we needed someone to listen to our stories. Everytime I listened to her stories I became super empathetic and wished her the best, and she sort of listen to mine and was there for me.
Whenever we discussed about ""guy"" problems and ""girl"" problems, we always tried to give eachother our best and honest answers, and in the end we would always sort of joke about how we're not the ""ideal"" types for eachother, and would always end the matter saying and emphasizing that we're besties forever.
Yes, we basically friendzoned each other and I was more than happy to be her friend; someone who can genuinely be a close friend. I gave her my perspective of what guys might think, and she did the vise versa. Everything was okay up until recently
She started school on september and had some issues with her family and the school work shes receiving made it even worse for her. To cheer her up, we went out to grab some drinks and chat about our life and how it sucked. The more I listen to her stories, the more empathetic I became. I came to a point where I wanted to be by her side and be as supportive as I can be, especially emotionally.
I unfortunately realized that I'm seriously in love with her. I'd wake up in the morning thinking about her, and couldn't stop thinking about her for the most part. I'd be concerned for her issues, and thinking about her smiles when I comfort makes me happy and brings smile on my face. I confronted myself and came to a conclusion that I do really like her.

Now, because we've friendzoned each other, I don't want to ruin our friendship by confessing my feelings to her, not especially when shes going through such hard time right now. I plan on slowly distancing myself and go on a hiatus until I get my feelings sorted out and hopefully realize that we're best off staying just as a friend. But part of me also really want to be more than just a friend with her, and show her that I truly like her as a person and her personal quality is endearing and loveable.

Any advice would be appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_dliobn,I (25F) dated a guy my boyfriend (25M) was friend with during middle school while we were separated,"Hi everyone, 
Okay so I put myself in a strange situation and I don‚Äôt know if I should tell it to my boyfriend or not. I feel guilty already so please it is NOT necessary to tell me what I did was not correct. I didn‚Äôt think things would turn this way at the moment. I know that I‚Äôm a selfish mess and I try to be a better person each day. 

My boyfriend and I were together for five years when I decided to end our relationship earlier this year, for various reasons. It was really difficult, for him of course but also for me even if i was the one who left. During 6 months, we kept talking because we still loved each other deeply but I could not saw a future with him anymore. So each of us dated other persons during that time and we were both honest about it. 

A couple of weeks ago, a guy my boyfriend and I knew from school (we were all in the same school) started to seduce me. Apart from knowing him from school, my boyfriend was friend with him during middle school as they attended the same place (i wasn‚Äôt). They didn‚Äôt talked to each other since that time, so roughly 12 years ago, and they are not friends anymore, they don‚Äôt have any contact since that time. I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in him tbh but I decided to give it a try since he was nice and was really interested in me. I was really reluctant at first knowing that they were friends when they were teens. I thought this was weird. I knew that if my bf knew about it he‚Äôll be really pissed. But I said fuck it because at the time I wasn‚Äôt considering going back with my then ex at all.

So i saw him during 3 weeks, then decided to end it because he wasn‚Äôt that nice but that‚Äôs another story. 

Weeks after, my bf (we were still separated at this time) and I go out to take a drink. We talked a lot and ended up spending the night together. Since then, we decided to take things slow and try to work on our relationship because feelings are still there 6 months after. 

But now I‚Äôm feeling really bad about it. I‚Äôm afraid he will learn it, I‚Äôm afraid we are going to meet the guy in the street, I‚Äôm afraid the guy will tell him everything if he saw us together because he was feeling really anxious about my bf knowing about our little story. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do here. Should I tell him about this guy before he learns it by someone else ? Should I tell nothing because well, they are not friends anymore since a long time now (12 years as I said), and we were not together anymore when I dated this guy ? Even if we were separated I know that he will be very angry if he knew that. He knows I dated some guys but he doesn‚Äôt know who. 

What‚Äôs your insight about it ?
Thank you very much for reading, and sorry for my bad English.",relationship_advice
t3_dlcsgw,Got fired from my job today &amp; cried in front of my boss,"I am a (20f), and I got completely caught off guard when last night my boss sent me a message through our work app asking me to come in and speak to him at 5, I also was not put on the schedule for the upcoming week. When I got there he sat and talked with me and said that they want to go ahead and move on without me, I was completely caught off guard because everything had been fine at work the day &amp; week before and no one was acting weird with me, or pulled me aside and said anything. I tried my best to hold back my tears I really did, but he kept talking and it only made it worse so I started crying and was thinking to myself oh geez do not be doing this right now, but I couldn‚Äôt hold it back. This is a restaurant job by the way, and I just had gotten it a month ago and I had to train for two weeks since it was my first legit time being a server, and I worked so hard to get the job so I only officially have been serving tables on my own there for the past 3 weeks. I really did not think I was doing that bad of a job, everytime I served a table the customers were always happy and I didn‚Äôt have any complaints or mess ups, I was on time every shift, and I made sure I did my opening and closing work and extra cleaning, and I was cool with everyone that I worked with including the boss and I never caused any problems. It‚Äôs just a shitty feeling and I feel embarrassed for not only crying but also not even being able to succeed at working at a freakin restaurant.",relationship_advice
t3_dldee2,I (19M) feel guilty for my friends suicide 2.5 years ago. My girlfriend (19F) does not know the grasp of my depression.,"I was diagnosed 2-3 years ago with moderate depression. My dad‚Äôs side of the family has a long history with this sort of mental health ‚Äúissues‚Äù (Depression to bipolarism...) so it did not come to my moms surprise that I too had that gene (I‚Äôve been told it can be passed through kin). 

A couple months after, the first girl to ever tell me she loved me, my first girlfriend (for more than a month) killed herself. At the time, we were not speaking to each other as she kinda dumped me for my friend (same time she started her depression, we did not know though).  The night she killed her self, she snap chatted me saying something a long the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry for all the grief I have caused you, I still love you‚Äù. I was 16 pushing on 17 so wanted to seem like I didn‚Äôt care and shit so just answered ‚Äúk‚Äù. The morning after, I was told she took her own life. 

It did not hit me at first what had happened, a human had been taken away from this world. My friend, or ex-friend, was gone, forever. The only person I had loved, the only person that had actually loved me, we had dated for almost a year, she was my first kiss (dated when we were like 13-14), and she was gone. It was a hard time for me. At first I had forgotten the message she had sent me. My mother and grandmother both had cancer, my dad was suing my mom, my brothers boyfriend faked having cancer. It was a hard time for me. 

A year or so later, still depressed, decided to go through my snapchat messages. Why not ya know. Scrolled all the way down to her name, where my saved message was.  I had forgotten. I don‚Äôt anymore. It hit me like a freight train. I still to this day feel guilty for her passing. I was the last person she talked to. I could have been there for her. I‚Äôve see. therapists and have been told that it‚Äôs not my fault yadda yadda. But how can I not feel guilty. Someone can‚Äôt just tell me I shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty WHEN I WAS THE LAST PERSON SHE TALKED TO. 

This grief has followed me until now. I‚Äôm bipolar, and have these depressive episodes where I just contemplate my existence and the harm I have caused to this world. My girlfriend, who has issues of her own knows I am bipolar. She has seen my episodes, but I have never truly told her what goes through my head. How I can‚Äôt sleep at night and think of ways to exit this world. How the reason I‚Äôm also tired is because I can‚Äôt fall asleep knowing how much I hate myself. She‚Äôs currently sleeping in my bed and i‚Äôm just in the bathroom. Writing this message, hoping one person reads it. Just one person, comments. Tells me how it will all be better, that I‚Äôm not alone. How people care for me. But Ive already heard that so many times. Nothing can erase these thoughts from my mind.

She does not know the grief I live in every single day. For the past hour, I‚Äôve just been looking out the window, thinking of ways to just disappear. Stealing my moms car and just running away, but I can‚Äôt grasp at the idea of my loved ones being in pain. I‚Äôve seen how it affects others loved ones.

I came in here asking for advice on my situation with my girlfriend, but in reality I just feel alone in this aquarium of a world where I feel trapped. I need help, hell I have help, but nothing seems to work. I want to tell her how I truly feel, but fear the pain and anguish she will go through. 

If anybody is out there, reach out.

Tell me what to change.

Tell me how to feel happy and not just a bipolar maniac episode. 

I need to tell her, but I fear the possibility of losing her to her own demons that I will bring out.",relationship_advice
t3_dlex76,I don‚Äôt know how to get my boyfriend of two years to clean his apartment.,"Hey guys.

I‚Äôm at my wits end with this. I‚Äôm not a neat freak, but my boyfriends apartment is filthy. The final straw was this morning when I was getting ready for work I walked into his bathroom to try and use his mirror to find his toilet has stopped working and he‚Äôs just been using it anyway without being able to flush. The smell was horrendous. I couldn‚Äôt use the bathroom. 

He wasn‚Äôt always like this - when I first met him almost two years ago I regularly saw him clean and he was always having people over for drinks or to hang out so he kept it in good condition. I don‚Äôt have my own place in the city where we work so I started staying with him regularly and I‚Äôm grateful, he‚Äôs never asked me for rent or to contribute financially. We‚Äôve even spoken about moving in together officially but honestly I never would in its present state. There‚Äôs cigarette butts on the floor, clothes everywhere in his bedroom. Loads of rubbish in his kitchen in bags that hasn‚Äôt been brought out in I don‚Äôt know how long. He just dumps stuff wherever it‚Äôs convenient. You can‚Äôt walk anywhere without having to step over things. He‚Äôs never cleaned his bathroom or kitchen appliances. We‚Äôve spoken about taking some time to clean it together and he always says he‚Äôs too tired. (I would take it into my own hands and have a few times, like a few weeks ago I deep cleaned his living room while he was away because I genuinely couldn‚Äôt relax after work it was so chaotic. He hasn‚Äôt cleaned his living room since, although he has used the clean state to finally start inviting other people over again. He doesn‚Äôt like me cleaning when he‚Äôs not there generally, for a reason he‚Äôs yet to tell me) 

I want to help him. He doesn‚Äôt have to live like this. I stay there roughly four to five days a week but I‚Äôm considering just commuting from my parents house to work again because it‚Äôs affecting my mental health. I‚Äôm not as attracted to him anymore. And without being crass, it‚Äôs extremely hard to be intimate with him at the moment because the surroundings are not great and I‚Äôm just less attracted to him in general over the cleanliness issue. He does have mental health issues, he‚Äôs had depression on and off in the past. I do think this dirty apartment situation is just a symptom of something deeper. But he won‚Äôt talk to me and brushes me off when I tell him that I want to work together to get his apartment back up to scratch. I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to do it on his own! I spend a lot of time there. But I‚Äôm at a loss. He won‚Äôt clean. His answer every time is that he works a lot and is always too tired. Without being mean, I work retail like him, I work longer hours in fact, and I know it‚Äôs tiring but in my opinion it‚Äôs not an excuse to live in filth. We‚Äôre too old for this. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I would be mortified to have anyone see how I live.",relationship_advice
t3_dliklj,Almost 40 is it too early for a mid life?,I‚Äôm a nearly 40 year old man. I‚Äôve been married for a long time now. My wife cheated some early in the relationship and I‚Äôve allways got the feeling she was more into me as a stable partner than a lover. Our sex life is beyond terrible and we have slept in separate bed rooms for 10 years now. On the flip side we have an amazing child and the family stuff and economic stuff is all good. I recently met a woman in her early 20‚Äôs. She makes me feel away that I‚Äôve never really felt before. If I had felt that way for my wife it was so many years ago I don‚Äôt remember it. This girl though is sleeping around with everything that has a pulse so I know it‚Äôs nothing and I‚Äôve yet to have sex with her just received oral. I know this one wouldn‚Äôt be the one to end a marriage over but it has made me wonder if I‚Äôm in a marriage that just needs ending. I‚Äôm afraid if I go out looking for something intangible all I will end up doing is missing what I have now. I‚Äôm also worried if I don‚Äôt go looking that I will soon be entirely too old to ever find a feeling that I yearn to experience and that will haunt me to the grave with regrets.,relationship_advice
t3_dlevw2,My ex is the love of my life,It has been an on and off relationship since we were 13 years old. Now at the age of 32 we have spent more then half our lives together. We have gone through everything with each other along our journey. We were each other‚Äôs firsts. She was even the first girl I had ever kissed. I can still remember that night and I‚Äôll never forget the taste of French vanilla lip gloss on her lips. We have gone through all the ups and downs of each other‚Äôs lives together. She has always been my best friend and the one I could always talk to about anything. We haven‚Äôt been together steady the entire time. We have had several breaks for up to 6 months sometimes. But have always found our way back to each other. 2 and a half years ago I proposed to her and she said yes! It was one of the happiest days of my life. Aside from the day she gave birth to our amazing son who is now 10 years old. But 8 months ago she broke up with me. She said she wasn‚Äôt happy with me anymore. She got involved in a relationship shortly after our break up. Her boyfriend went to jail about 2 months after they started going out. A few weeks after that she text me when I had lost a very close friend of mine to see how I was doing. That started an open channel of conversation back and forth which lead to us starting to hang out again. I work away from home during the week and would come home on the weekends. While I was home she would stay with me for the weekend. I told her I still loved her and wanted her back. She told me she still loved me but was confused and didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore. She wanted to be with me but she didn‚Äôt know how to tell her current boyfriend cause she didn‚Äôt want to hurt him. She was afraid of what he might do since he was in jail and might get to depressed. Things were going great up until about 2 weeks ago now when she all of a sudden cut me out completely. She blocked me on her phone and blocked me on all forms of social media going no contact. She has messaged me once telling me she can‚Äôt see how things will work for us in the future. I love her with all my heart and this has put me in a downward spiral. These last 2 weeks have been the darkest days of my life. I have gotten extremely depressed and have had some horrible thoughts inside my head. I am ashamed to say it but I don‚Äôt know if I would be here right now to say this if it wasn‚Äôt for my son. He just had a birthday a few days ago. Which is the biggest reason for me not going through with taking my life because I don‚Äôt want him to live with the thought of me taking my own life every time his birthday comes around. I feel so trapped in my life now and don‚Äôt see a way out. I have nobody to talk to now since she was the only one I could go to before when I needed to talk to someone. I have read 100s of these posts trying to find some guidance on a way to deal with this. But I have never moved on from her in the past and don‚Äôt see how I ever will. Like I said before we have been together for over half our lives. I don‚Äôt remember my life before her and I don‚Äôt want to know what life is like without her in it. She is my everything! I just wish I was hers. If anyone has some advice PLEASE help me.,relationship_advice
t3_dllppv,Girlfriend (23F) was fired from her job for harassment but denies to me (21M) she did anything,"My girlfriend got her first corporate job a few months ago after graduating from college, where we met.

As far as I knew from what she told me things were going well.

She just came home saying she was fired for sexual harassment but then said that it was a guy doing it to her and he played the system as a privileged white male and framed it on her.

She showed me some chats where she is flirting with her male coworker but it is clear that she was only just looking for help with concepts she didn‚Äôt understand. She previously studied C++ and Java but at this job they are using PHP and MySQL. And he has the experience so she was just trying to get help from him.

Eventually he started turning her down for her help and that is when he reported her and tried to blame her for it because he was all butthurt about having to train a female employee. She also showed me his open Facebook where he has made some misogynist comments.

I am honestly a little upset about the flirting, but I understand. Being a woman means that men often won‚Äôt help out women when it comes to training and assisting them in the same way they do for fellow men, especially fellow white men.

I insist that we call a lawyer and sue the fuck out of them but she says that she wants to just move on and find another job ASAP instead of gaining a reputation as a lawsuit lady early on in her career.

My question is well, should I believe her? I think the facts line up but there is a 1% chance where maybe she did do something? Idk.

My wife(23F) read a lot books about baby sitting, I fully believe she can take care of our baby single handedly (of couse I will help whenever she needs). But my family doesn't trust her experience. They often visit our house, and give advice. Mostly about very small things, like how many clothes should the baby put on. I dont even know why they care about. But my wife said she feels a lot of pressure and wants to move away from here.

This is tough. I don't want to hurt anyone's feeling, but want to protect my wife at the same time. What do I do?

So I went to their houses and said I dont like what they are doing right now. And I have already signed up for a new house far from here(that's a lie I am doing it now).  They said alright but I promise to invite them for baby's birthday event and post more pics on social media so they know we are doing ok. I agreed. After that, I went home and told my wife. Also, I showed this post to her. She laughed and hugged me and said ""I love you and our baby. I will never leave you."" I said I am sorry for not being a good husband earlier. She said it was just some small complains(Me: no its not) and I took it too serious. Then we cuddled and started planning for future.

There's this girl. Quiet, sort of rude to everyone, sarcastic, sardonic. Conservative family, very conservative. Hasn't dated before. After 8 months of being friends, I asked her out, she said yes. She had difficulty sharing and opening up when we were friends but she shared about her stuff and told me she hadn't really done it with anyone else before. We decided to take it slow after we started dating, haven't even kissed yet. She didn't like physical comfort either, like an arm around the shoulder or hand holding. She stopped opening up, stopped responding when we used to talk. She didn't want to do any thing with me, like go on a date, watch a movie, play Scrabble. She didn't want to do a lot of things. But she did say she trusted me. I think I'm still certain she likes me romantically. She shared a lot of stuff with me. We broke up after dating for two months, and she said she wants to be friends and get to know each other better. But she's becoming distant even as friends. She holds hands and hugs one of her other male friends who she calls her brother. But she's always uncomfortable with me. She does have intimacy issues. The ""brother"" she hasn't told a lot of stuff to, but she still feels more comfortable around him. I just want to be with her, whether as a friend or a boyfriend it doesn't matter. She's scared of people leaving, and I've told her a million times I'm here to stay, but it almost seems like she's pushing me away. I want to stay close to her, make her feel like she's not alone. I don't care if the romantic element is there or not, being friends works too. But her intimacy issues seem to keep her from getting close to me. What do I do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlif91,Me (24M) and my ex-girlfriend (21F) were planning on getting back together but her behavior is making me unsure we should. I am unsure what I should do and feel like I have exhausted options to make my opinion heard.,"Hey all, this is my first post to r/relationship_advice and I am thus somewhat unfamiliar with the proceedings, do's, and don'ts. I know this post will be a bit all over the place and while I try to make it structured there is just a lot of info I think is relevant to share. 

**Let me first set the stage**: I am a 24 year old Guy from Europe and my ex-girlfriend (21) is on the other side of the world right now. She broke up with me before she left but immediately regretted it and we have been having steady contact during her stay there and both wanted to try being together again once she comes back (December). We were together in a happy relationship for 2.5 years during which we lived together before we broke up and during that time I spend half a year on exchange outside Europe. I even was on the verge of asking her to marry me but didn't have enough money to buy a nice ring so decided to postpone it. 

**The advice I need**: While she is on exchange we first decided to give each other space to figure out what we both wanted, and after summer break decided we wanted to give it another shot once she came back. We decided that in order for that to succeed we needed regular contact and lots of open communication, while also being exclusive with each other. This also has to do with the fact that in February I have to go on exchange again so we will have had limited personal contact for about 1.5 years by the time I return. Now over the last few weeks I have been feeling sidelined, and I am unsure what to do. I for myself decided to very clearly insinuate that I am not doing very well and give her until the end of the week to pick up on it and show that she cares for me and have some proper contact. If that does not happen, I think (at this moment) it would be better for my own mental health to end contact completely. Thoughts/suggestions?

**The reasons I am feeling sidelined are the following**: She only texts me a few times a day, even though I clearly stated on multiple occasions that I would like more contact. She is busy with all sorts of other things (as I can see on snapchat and insta) but makes no attempts to carve out a bit of her time to call/skype. This didn't used to be the case and when she was feeling down while over there we did have a lot of contact, it is just now that she has friends over all the time that we almost don't talk anymore. I feel terrible because of this, and am clearly signalling to her that I am not doing okay but she makes no effort to ask up on that or help me. Over the last few weeks I have felt powerless about this, and when we last skyped I made it clear why I was so upset and she promised to change her behavior, but I see little to no improvement. She does tell me that she loves me and says sweet things, but reacts with such infrequency and makes no timeslot available for intensified contact that I am unsure if I should believe her. I don't think I can keep on doing this until she comes back and I am very concerned about this behavior repeating itself when I go on exchange. During our last call I made it clear this was the last chance I was giving her to try and save the possibility of getting back together again, but it does not seem like there is improvement other than her saying more sweet things when she does text me. So basically her words and actions do not line up. 

**The reasons I am unsure to cut off contact**: I know that when we are together and when we can talk about these things we always sort issues out. I also truly believe this is the woman I could grow old with and genuinely love her. Also she tells me on many instances that she wants to grow old with me and loves me, and on some moments she does show this. I feel that if I cut it off I might ruin my chance of growing old with someone who on many levels understands me, cares for me, and who for a long time has been my best friend.

**TL&amp;DR**: Me and my ex-gf have a good chance of getting back together but her behavior is hurting me and I feel powerless because of limited contact and repeatedly having made my case already with no adequate change in her behavior. 

**PS**: I am not trying to change her behavior as in some fundamental aspects of her personality, I just want her to show me that I am important to her and that I am at least equally worth of her time as other things are. I feel like I have exhausted most methods to make this clear to her except for maybe making an ultimatum, but I don't believe those are a great way to get your way in a relationship. 

**PPS**: Obviously this is only my side of the story and so much intricacies remain unstated in this post, I would be open to sharing more (personal) details if someone wants to in a private conversation on reddit or a phonetic medium.

t3_dldwzf,"I (F 23) have been disowned by my father for 5 years, my extended family has no idea. Now they want to get back in touch with me.","23(F)My family is a Muslim family who never followed radically. I was allowed different things as a teen like going out with my friends at the cinema and having a boyfriend. I would always leave doors open and make sure someone was in the house when friends would be around. 

When I was 18, I decided to go to the U.K. as an au pair and look after children. I have had a British partner who I presented to my family back home. Things kicked off because my father and step mother didn‚Äôt like the guy (which they were right ), After this my dad forced me to move back to my home country and live with them again. He said I would be able to study there and pursue a career but when I got there he did not let me leave the house for 3 months. I was essentially under house arrest. No social life, no work, no studying, just staying in the house and cleaning up. I felt like I had no choice so I ran away. After doing this, my father disowned me. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my parents  in 5 years and they won‚Äôt even let me speak to my siblings. My parents threatened them to be kicked out if they ever did.

The problem is, none of my other relatives know what happened. I think m y parents don‚Äôt dare tell my Muslim grandma that I am the tattooed black sheep of the family.

For fear I blocked all my relatives in Arabic countries, but recently one of my cousins and I started speaking again. My grandma is asking why I haven‚Äôt reached out to her all these years. 

What do I say to her? Do I tell her what happened? Do I keep her in the dark? Any advice would be really appreciated.

She obviously doesn‚Äôt know anything that happened and been kept in the dark by my parents. She is Muslim too so odds are she would probably take my dad‚Äôs side without even knowing the full story

t3_dllibp,How (or even if) to tell my (26M) Girlfriend (25F) how much I don't want her to cut her hair.,"So my girlfriend has a friend that has relatively short hair (think like, around Ruby Rose length) as opposed to my girlfriend who has hair that ends slightly above her butt. Lately, they've been talking, and the friend has been telling her how great having short hair is, how much easier it is, and my GF thinks that her friend looks fantastic with short hair. All of which is culminating in my girlfriend very seriously thinking about cutting her hair to that length.

I'm not gonna try and make myself look good so I'll put it bluntly, I am not attracted to girls with short hair at all. I wish I understood what chemical shit in my brain made it that way, or if it's the result of sexist societal expectations or what, but the second that a girl cuts her hair any and all attraction is gone.

I'm very much aware that this is my problem, and I'm also very sympathetic to the fact that long hair is a pain in the ass to deal with and take care of so I 100% understand why she's thinking about doing it. However, if she cuts her hair I know that I will start to look at her differently and lose my attraction to her which would obviously hurt our relationship. On the flipside, if I tell her that I don't want her to cut her hair I'm afraid that I'll cross the line into ""Controlling boyfriend"" territory which would obviously hurt our relationship.

So, I guess my question is, is there a good way for me to approach this? I think that ""If you cut your hair I'll leave you"" is borderline abusive and I don't want to put her in that situation. I want her to know that she's her own person and can do whatever she wants with her appearance, but I know what affect this will have on me if she goes through with it and I'm wondering if it would be better to let her know how I feel about it or what.

He‚Äôs the only customer i wouldn‚Äôt get mad at if he came in right as I‚Äôm closing because he‚Äôs so nice to talk to. 
We‚Äôve had so many good interactions and laughs, most memorably when he ran in my store right at closing yelling to not put away anything, and I got scared and screamed, then we laughed it off and I made him his sandwich and he stayed a few minutes after closing to talk to me. 
Mostly we would talk about his job or education or politics, or even the new Joker movie (would recommend, btw)
He made me a paper airplane when he talked about how he made one for his coworker and I mentioned I didn‚Äôt know how to. It‚Äôs a really sweet airplane too.

She would hype me up to him because I would come in off the clock to help her if she gets slammed with customers or is overwhelmed, and he‚Äôs said that was a real special thing of me to do, that I was sweet, and she asked if he was in any relationships and found out he is single. 
She told him that I really liked him, and he said ‚ÄúI could say the same‚Äù

We've had a handful of successful times, but more often than not, I get nervous and I lose it. I am VERY attracted to her and think about sex w/her frequently. I am only filled w/ frustration each time I fail. She has decided it's because she isnt good enough for me, and says I've made her feel unwanted and the problem is her, regardless of what I've said, which couldn't be more wrong.

Videogames aren't a bad thing in our relationship, we both love games! But recently it's like that's all he does? Its worrying because he does the same thing every day: wake up, go on Netflix, go on youtube, go on switch, have dinner and then stay up until 8am watching tv or playing games. that can't be good for his mental and physical health. He's not really an outside kind of person (I love the outdoors but now all we do it sit in bed and watch tv). Its just getting me down honestly. The room is a shit tip and I ask time and time again if WE can tidy up and it's always ""yeah"" or ""some other day"" but that never happens, the day never comes. I don't want to start cleaning up after him, I'm not that kind of person and I feel like he would expect me to do it every time. You make a mess, you clean it up simple as. 

He started back at uni in september. He went in for a week. This is the most worrying part, he has totally stopped going in! He relies on his money from student loans to pay his rent and utility bills but it's almost been a month of no attendance and I'm scared he is gonna have his funding stopped. He doesnt seem to care. If I bring it up he gets kinda mad. He he loses his money he will be financially dependent on me and I simply can't afford to look after another person. I barely make enough to look after myself and even then I'm struggling to make it through the month. 

The bottom line is he is lazy, unproductive, kind of a slob and he doesn't seem to care. I have anxiety and depression so I worry uncontrollably constantly. Its exhausting and our situation it's only making things worse. He's not a kid anymore and neither am I, we have actual responsibilities but he doesn't seem to care. He also doesn't seem to care that I cant support him financially without jeopardising myself. 

I'm not in a better position myself but this is my gap year. I'm focusing on myself and my mental health, running a small business and working towards my Piano grade 6 so I'm not the most productive person in the world. I dont just know what to do anymore.

t3_dli2sh,My (25F) boyfriend (30M) has so many sexual issues. And I'm exhausted.,"Some quick backstory: we've been together around 2 years, live together, etc. Our relationship has been not healthy from the beginning. He had a crippling porn addiction and intimacy issues that prevented us from having a healthy sex life or him communicating his needs effectively. Basically his dick wouldn't work for like 6 + months and he claimed it was a medical issue, and then claimed it was my fault, and then finally broke down and explained that he had a porn issue that he has been ashamed of. I'm not a prude and so I stuck it out and trusted that he would just kinda self monitor and work on it.

Flash forward to a year ago, right after we moved in together, and I find out he has been cheating on me. While our sex life was struggling (see above), he was sexting dozens upon dozens of people from places like r/dirtypenpals. We have gone to couples and individual therapy, and things will always seem to be improving, and then the other shoe will drop. Two months after I caught him cheating, he came clean that he still had a Fetlife that he was using to look at people in a town very close to ours that he was working in. Two months after that, a porn addiction relapse. It's honestly been hell and taken so much away from our relationship and my self esteem, because he also doesn't deal well with discussing any of it.

Now we've finally made what seems to be solid progress. Our communication is improved, we have a lot more tender moments, our sex life is decent, but it's incredibly vanilla and there's no flirting ever. This is pretty atypical for the two of us, as we're both fairly kinky individuals. I talked to him about it last night, and he says that it's just 'not thrilling' and will sometimes stress him out to sext me. I don't really know what to do anymore. He pretty much shuts me down when I try to flirt or initiate anything. I'm trying not to be ~that girlfriend~ but it does make me a little anxious given our past. 

I love him and see a lot of potential in the other areas of this, but I feel so sexually stifled and bad about myself. The worst part is that I couldn't be interested in someone else if I tried. I only have eyes for him. I'm seeking some unbiased opinions because this is making me crazy and a lot of it is too private to share with even close friends.",relationship_advice

Help!","So my partner is the most wonderful man - genuine, loving and a total family guy. We are getting married soon. He wants to move back to Portugal in 6 years when he‚Äôs finished his training. 

I feel like I‚Äôm so torn right now. I don‚Äôt adore the U.K. but its my home. I don‚Äôt want to uproot my life for the millionth time (as I was adopted and had a difficult upbringing and life, so a lot of moving around) I need stability.  

When we got together I knew his heart was in his home country as he has a huge family and loves the weather, food and laid back culture. I have little family here, am adopted and do not have a good relationship with my mother (for very good reason) - I always said that the language would be a problem for me, but it‚Äôs not a closed door and we would need to see how things are and whether that would be possible in the future. I genuinely meant that.

I‚Äôve been trying really hard to learn the language, had hundreds of lessons but I am really not good with learning new languages and Portuguese is really quite difficult. I don‚Äôt foresee me ever being fluent or communicating fully, my brain just isn‚Äôt wired that way.

We‚Äôve now got a beautiful baby girl coming up to 1 years old and this also changes things. I‚Äôve spent more time out in Portugal and the language issue and the fact that many of his family don‚Äôt speak English at gatherings, leads me to feel so left out and like an outsider. When we are there, yes it is nice but I long to be back where I can be understood and feel included again. I try my best to speak the language but it‚Äôs really difficult and I can‚Äôt articulate myself.

His family are everything to him. I know if we moved there it would be visits to and from them all the time and our doors would always have people coming through them. I‚Äôm also quite a private person and like my own space. Some of his family are also quite strong minded and dogmatic when it comes to how children should be raised - and don‚Äôt hold back giving you their thoughts! I notice many cultural differences that I didn‚Äôt before.

I also like to know that I am able to work somewhere easily and not have problems with constantly being out of work (even the Portuguese nationals have many issues getting work!) 

I spoke to my partner about all this and said as it stands I don‚Äôt feel I could leave my settled life here in the U.K. in 6 years time and go to a country where I have no friends or family, and don‚Äôt speak the language.

He was really upset, cried and said the very thought of growing old in the U.K. and dying in a nursing home makes him truly miserable. He said life is too short not to spend it with the people you love.

I have my extended family close by who I‚Äôm close with, and some close friends. I‚Äôd be leaving them behind. It‚Äôs such a big request for me to do this but the thought of keeping my husband stuck in a place he doesn‚Äôt like for the rest of his life breaks my heart into a million pieces.

So do I sacrifice my own life and stability and happiness for the sake of my partner fulfilling his dream and my daughter having a nice life out there? I know portugal would be a magical place to grow up for my daughter - and she would love being with her cousins and close to her lovely Grandmother but I have these visions of me just being so left out, the outsider and being completely dependent on my husband.

We have always been open to inviting a third person into our relationship but I never really prioritized it as I‚Äôm happy with it just being the two of us. Basically if the right person comes along so be it. 

This year, my cousin Despoina started going to college in our town (Despoina and I had very little interaction growing up so I hadn‚Äôt really known where she was going to college until she had already moved here.)  Now I know the Reddit hive mind will say ‚Äúew incest gross‚Äù but Despoina and I are not full cousins. Our mothers are actually only half sisters.  I researched this ahead of time and it‚Äôs more of a social taboo than a medical issue. Anyway we started hanging out and I introduced her to Narkissa, but I never told her we were cousins, just family friends. 

Things progressed and Despoina moved in with us and began a relationship with me, a separate relationship with Narkissa and we have also had threesomes. 

Everything was perfect until my mother, Ambrosia, visited us. I didn‚Äôt want her visiting because I knew shed made a big deal over Despoina but I couldn‚Äôt find a way out of it.  Ambrosia outed us as ‚Äúcousins‚Äù and I had to explain to Narkissa that we are actually only half cousins and there‚Äôs almost zero biological problems.

Narkissa is bothered that she has been lied to and also bothered that she has been having sex with my cousin unknowingly.  I find that without Narkissa in the picture I‚Äôm not as attracted to Despoina and not even sure I want to continue the relationship. What do I do?

Sometimes I feel like all of my problems are happening in my head and I should stick to the relation since the love still exists, but other times it seems to me that our ""love style"" is just not compatible and feel ""trapped"" especially when she starts complaining about how I don't give her any attention and that she feels like an object in the relation. (I'm not perfect at all, truth is myself I do feel how I don't fullfill all my responsabilities as a partner ...)",relationship_advice
t3_dlhwws,I‚Äôm interested in a coworker but we‚Äôre not scheduled to work together anymore.,"
I am an 18yo guy who works at a cafe, and one of my co-workers (22F) is jaw-droppingly beautiful. We used to work once a week together over the summer. I‚Äôm terrible at initiating conversation with anybody new so she eventually started talking to me after we worked together for a bit. We got to know each other a little bit over the few hours we got to see each other each week, and she would occasionally light-heartedly tease me about certain things with other co-workers around, nothing special I think. 

I was planning to stop working when I went to school, and when I told her that on my last day, she told me she would miss me / that makes her sad / asked me why Im quitting. honestly I have no clue if this is just her being nice and I‚Äôm thinking to hard about this, or if she was genuinely sad. 
I go to school and boss texts me a couple weeks later that they are short on people and asks if I come back on weekends so I decide why not, can‚Äôt be bad. I think I had maybe 2-3 shifts with her after coming back on weekends, but then she got scheduled to weekdays only. 

The cafe I work at is very good so I go there with friends about once a week for a drink on weekdays, so I see my co-worker there when I go and I chat with her a little bit when my friends walk away. One time she mentions to me that her and other coworkers were talking about me earlier about how they wish I was there when it was busy (she has told me before this as well when I came in with friends that she was talking about me with other coworkers),and I teased her this time by saying something like ‚Äùyou talk about me all the time‚Äù, and she told me she just thinks I‚Äôm really cool. I don‚Äôt know if i am absolutely clueless or something and she was actually interested in me then,  or if she was just being nice to me again, but I just shrugged it off as the latter and didn‚Äôt say much after that and went back to my friends. 

So I was kind of starting to have feelings for her at this point, I had a little before but they were growing after this, maybe I just develop crushes too easy idk. We worked together again recently because I was on fall break so I worked a couple week days with her, and after I opened the shop by myself each morning and coworkers arrived at opening time, I basically just talked with her until I was off because the shop was dead at that time. Of course I was too much of a pussy to tell her how I really feel about her. 

Our shop has a Facebook group chat that our manager sends our weekly schedule to, so I thought since I didn‚Äôt know when I would be working with her next, I would add her on Facebook. Did that, and she hasn‚Äôt added me back lol, maybe she just doesn‚Äôt check Facebook, who knows. But I have no idea what to do now since I don‚Äôt know when I will see her next and I still kinda have feelings for her. If any of you have advice or have input on whether or not you think she is just being nice to me or if she is actually interested me please let me know!

t3_dlhwvc,20M being lead on 22F,"So just to preface this, this is a girl I met online
We live about 300 miles apart.
But anyways, I met this girl on this beta for a game
And we got to talking
I added her to my friend group, because she seemed cool
We started playing other games together, and really enjoying each other company.
Around February, we started to flirt back and forth.
This progressed into sexting, and at the time that's all it was. It was just messing around
And then a few months into this, we start talking more romantically instead of sexually.
We flirted and talked about being together, but she said she wasn't ready. Because she had gotten out of a 5yr relationship. I understood, and I was there for her during her panic attacks and down moments surrounding that and her family problems.

Anyways, we start talking more and more romantically, even to the point of her and I saying ""I love you"" and such things. 
I ask her out one day, and she says it's not the time.
I said okay
But over the next 3 months after it devolved into basically she never loved me like that, that she ""tried"" to love me like that but couldn't.
We stopped talking because I just was so hurt, probably more than I have ever been in my entire life.
She says she wants to be single to pursue her life ambitions of making her family proud of her.

And cut to today, technically last night. 
I see a post on her Facebook and Instagram, of her and a guy.
The caption was ""spent the weekend with a great man"".

I messaged her saying that I've had enough and I couldn't forgive her for all of this, because she wanted me to forget that she hurt me and to try and be just friends, not romantic side, no sexual side, nothing. Just friends
And I told her I'm done, and she says she's been done for a while

I unfriended her on every platform I could
But seeing her with that guy is burned into my mind and I'm broken rn

So my question is, how do I move on? How do I get the image of them out of my head?",relationship_advice

t3_dlhv41,How to Break is off with my Friend's GF,"Hi Reddit!
Posting on mobile so sorry for any format issues. Names have been changed to protect the privacy of those involved. Thanks for reading 

So my GF (24F) and I (24M) live with another couple, Mick (24M) and Karen (21?F). Mick and I have been friends for a few of years through college, and I lived with him in the past without issue. This past year we decided to share a rental house as 2 couples. I've known Karen for about a year before that, and never had any issues with her, so I thought this would be great. Well, over the year I've realized how much I really dislike Karen. I find her very narcissistic, ingenuine, and all-around annoying. Me and Mick have spoken in the past  (roughly a year ago) about how he was unhappy at the time, but wanted to give her a chance to change her ways. Long story short - nothing has changed. If anything she's gotten worse. 

Whenever Mick hangs out with me and my GF we all have a great time with us, and tells us so. Any time Karen comes along everyone is tense, she kills the mood, and sort of ruins things for us. He hasn't directly told us that he feels the same, but his mood is 100% different at events when she comes. He becomes quiet and stoic which is not like himself, and generally seems annoyed but never speaks out. 

Mick and Karen are moving out soon, but me and my GF don't want Karen to come along when we see Mick in the future. I've never told him how we feel about her, and I genuinely worry that he will end up being unhappy and stuck as she keeps trying to pressure him to marry her. 

Do I say something? How do I bring it up, and tell him how I feel without being the asshole? Any help with this would be lovely. 

Thanks again!",relationship_advice

There were heavy rains yesterday and my coworker came to tell me and some others that we were leaving work early yesterday. He said 'Allie, start packing up, we're leaving because of the terrible weather'. I responded, 'Oh, really? great'. He said, 'yeah' then walked off to tell others. And my bf overheard that little exchange and has been mad. 



All night he's been talking about inappropriate closeness with coworkers and having work boundaries. But there is no reason to even have that discussion at all. He said my name and told me we were leaving work.



We've been together for 2 and a half years and idk what to do. This is also my first real job since graduating 3 years ago so it bothers me that he's up my arse about this.

t3_dlhptu,My bf(23M) is not sure if he loves me(25F)...,"He's younger but very sweet and caring. I think we're a good match because he's very mature for his age and I'm a bit childish in nature. We make a good couple. But things felt off for a while... He's not distant but he's not super excited about me, likes sex but not super into it unless I initiate -- he also initiates but less than me for sure -- and just generally a bit off. I know he loves me but I don't know if it's that passionate love, it feels like a very close friendship love. I was just wondering what the problem was so I tried probing him and he tried to deflate. When I asked further he said he doesn't know.

I kind of think he feels this way because I'm always there for him and we started from Tinder without initially thinking about having a relationship. He doesn't really know what it's like to be without me or maybe he feels like he just doesn't want to lose me as a friend. I told him to think about it and that I'd give him some time alone. I'm a bit hurt but I can't really do anything but hope for the best.

Is he just confused or feels responsible for me somehow? Did I suffocate him with love? Idk what to think.",relationship_advice
t3_dlhpqb,Should you always breake up if she [27F] doesn't want to commit with me [30M]?,"Hello everyone - I've been in a romantic relationship with a girl for 3 months now. We meet this summer after 3 years that I know her. She took drawing courses at my studio 3 years ago. After the courses we were so attracted to each other that ended up together for a month then everything ended because we were so young. 

This summer we meet again. We agreed do have an easy relationship this time. We were feeling mature and we were not fighting a lot. We were seeing each other regularly and also decided to start a drawing studio together. Everything was fine but 3 days ago we had an argument and she became very cold. We were walking and I didn't hear what she said and when I asked her again she refused to tell me and got upset. I also got upset that she behaved like this and she told me she needed space, needed to rethink our attachment and the next day became harsh.

She has been with her family on a family trip and we've been only talking/texting about work. She also sent me a message saying sorry she was harsh. She doesn't want commitment and her life is not me. She wasn't looking for commitment because this requires energy and dedication. She doesn't want to be harsh with the person she undoubtedly loves and she wants me to be happy with what we have.

I don't know what to do now. Should I write to her that I miss and love her or this will make me look very attached? Should I consider telling her to break up? 

I will be very happy if I'll have some feedback.",relationship_advice

t3_dlhozc,"I(24F) broke up with him (21M) right before his deployment, but wonder if I was wrong/too hard in how I treated him","I dated a guy who had to do mandatory military service. We‚Äôd only known each other for a couple of months before he got deployed and had talked in length about what we would do before he had to go. In the beginning of our relationship it was clear he wanted to be more serious but knew he didn‚Äôt have a lot of time, so we kind of teeter tottered on the edge of serious and casual but eventually decided we would at least try. 

Fast forward to a few weeks before his deployment. He tells me he is going to spend some time with family. No problem- I respect that. But he never picks up the phone again. Goes from normal texting to monotone responses once a day to responding once every few days. I get that he‚Äôs got a lot running through his mind, but something seems off. My gut is telling me that it‚Äôs time to call it quits. This is why: there had been previous instances in which he would push my boundaries with physical intimacy, and times when he would just leave me in a hotel by myself until the next afternoon. It seemed like he wasn‚Äôt invested but wasn‚Äôt strong enough to call it off himself. I told him I needed to talk when he had a moment but he still wouldn‚Äôt answer so I broke up with him in a text message. It was so shitty but he left me with no other option. He didn‚Äôt even respond until I messaged him again two days later. He kept apologizing for everything and told me he was actually in Vietnam with his cousins before deployment which is why he couldn‚Äôt answer like before. I was so angry that I told him his words were meaningless without acting and that he should grow up. 

He recently came out of basic training and all he said back was thanks. I felt so guilty that I wrote him a message that he read but never responded to. I just feel bad because it must be so hard to go through military especially when you are forced to do so and have to sacrifice two years, but I‚Äôm also so pissed at how he left things. There were times when we would have arguments about the stuff mentioned above such as boundaries and he would improve after I told him what I was and wasn‚Äôt ok with. I know I was harsh. I just don‚Äôt know if I misinterpreted him or if I really did do the right thing. And if I did do the right thing, whether I did it the wrong way.",relationship_advice
t3_dlho7w,Boyfriend (27M) doesn't want sex for a year now. Advice? (26F),"My boyfriend and I have been living together in my house now for 5 years. We are both artists using my apartment as a studio, as his parents aren't really supportive of his career. That said, we moved in together thinking we could both focus in our art, and our relationship.

Things were ok in the first 3 years. Once, twice a week. Then it became pretty scarce in the fourth year, about once in a month or two. At that point, i did talk to him that i want more passion and sex in our relationship, but he always told me that he's just stressed because of his mother (who keeps on pressuring him to get another job). Now as Im typing this, it has been a complete year and its driving me nuts. 

I feel so unwanted, and ugly because he's just rejecting all my advances. Whenever i try to initiate (in creative, sexy ways, mind you! Like wearing a cute new lingerie, you know the stuff), he just simply smiles and tries to hug me in a cute way til i give up - which i liked at first, it was adorable - but now its just ridiculous. 

I came into this relationship thinking we'll be having crazy good sex a lot, because he paints damn good erotica, and i really do love him and feel like he's the kind of guy i would marry, if only this issue didn't exist. But each time i try nowadays to talk to him about it, he just gets mad and we'd just fight. Its sad, and it frustrates me so much. I do masturbate on my own to ease the drive, but of course im longing for that passion with him that we used to share. But since he gets mad about it, i no longer even try to initiate talking about it, because im afraid.

Its also good to note that i think he's suffering from mild depression and bipolar disorder, but he doesn't want to get diagnosed or get checked at all. He hates going to the doctor and told me that if he knows he can still figure things out himself, he will. But like i said, its been a year now and nothing. Its affected my self-esteem somehow and i feel really unwanted, very far from the me five years ago that was confident, and sexy, and just happy. Im also afraid that if this is happening now that we're in our late 20's, what more when we're older? 

Any advice? What can i do to help save this relationship? Is it time to throw in the towel?",relationship_advice

t3_dlhm8w,My[34m] girlfriend[28f] has no idea what turns her on after 6 years.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 years and it all seems great. We have lots of hobbies in common and our work schedules give us a couple days off at a time together. We have a lot of fun but lately I've been noticing she doesn't initiate like she used to. We used to have sex almost every other day. We got into some roleplaying and toys but they all seem like foreplay we end up ditching halfway through in favour of just sex.

Last night we had built up the same as we ever do. I kissed her neck and talked dirty to her, which usually makes her melt, and she was being flirty back but we were focused on a board game. Once it was done I suggested we get intimate and she got defensive and said she felt weird. She started putting the blame on me, saying I wasn't doing anything to turn her on and that she couldn't just get it up like me. I told her that wasn't true and she agreed and insisted it's her depression making her feel suddenly insecure.

This also happened two days ago, we had some time before a friend was coming over and she couldn't get in the headspace for sex. She said it was depression and anxiety for the friend coming over and that she was sexually frustrated because of this too. We had a good talk about expectations but I still feel unsatisfied and confused by her reactions.

She definitely struggled with depression early in our relationship, and it comes up from time to time. But I didn't see any warning signs, she wasn't sluggish or sad, it came up as soon as I suggested sex.

Probably the weirdest thing is that she kept saying she doesn't know what turns her on. We've been intimate regularly and she suddenly doesn't know what gets her hot and bothered?! She said she's confused by it too, but that's frustrating and now I'm being put on the spot to spin her from a bad mood to a good one. And if I bring up sex it seems like she's going to feel pressured and get defensive again.

Can anyone help me approach re-learning what gets my GF going without putting the pressure of sex into the equation?

TLDR: GF claims depression to deny sex, says she doesn't know what turns her on any more. I don't know how to approach this since any attempts at turning her on are read as me pressuring her for sex before she's turned on.",relationship_advice

Earlier before I met her she was in a relationship. Anyways during the last month she became distant and vindictive, and eventually she broke up with me because she ‚Äúcouldnt handle a long-term relationship‚Äù. 

Then, 2 months after we broke up, i found out that the reason she broke up with me is because she was having ‚Äúfantasies‚Äù about him while we were together. They apparently broke up after the first month.

Her ex was emotionally unavailable and cheated on her many times. They also had sexual issues since he was so addicted to porn that he didnt want sex. Even by my exes‚Äô own words, im the best boyfriend she‚Äôs ever met/had. During our relationship, she was very judgemental and manipulative. Once she told me that if i didnt say that i loved her by our 1 year anniversary, we‚Äôd have to break up. She frequently judged even the smallest thing i did, saying that it was annoying. She said she was like that because her ex and her ALWAYS fought so its all she knew. Other than that everything was good, we both have similar tastes and I was told i was the first person to make her orgasm.

I texted her about her getting back with her ex today, and at first she tried to lie and deny it. Then she apologized and said she never meant to hurt me and said ‚Äúits better than if i stayed with you in that state, now i have closure that i‚Äôll never be with him‚Äù.

Now, i know by how it sounds that she seems toxic. But its hard to describe everything about a girl you thought you loved in a single reddit post. I still miss her and i especially miss her family/dogs.

So I'm in a LDR (met in-person first then I had to come back home), and it's been almost 2 months. We've been going strong, texting each other constantly as well as calling everyday, video calling once a week, etc. I can really really tell he loves me and cares for me a lot.

When we started out as friends 3 months ago, I asked him where he \[25M\] worked (not his job, but specifically where he worked, like the company). He said something random and kinda mumbled, and I couldn't hear him at that time, but just to be polite, I just said ""Oh, cool!"" LOL

But a few hours ago, we called and I suddenly remembered that I forgot where he worked. I told him that I couldn't hear him because he mumbled the first time he told me. But he became weird -- he tried to avoid the question and didn't tell me where he works. Like, he straight-up just didn't tell me, he tried to make a joke. I know what he is (job position), but it is so strange that he won't tell me the company he works at.... And to be quite honest, I'm really pissed. I tell him everything about my life, but the fact that he can't tell me the company he works at (after asking him twice!) makes me feel like he doesn't trust me...? I thought our relationship was solid  -- we promised each other that we would tell each other everything, especially since we're long distance. I just don't understand why he would keep this a secret from me, especially because he's a software engineer. 

So Reddit, am I over-reacting or do I have every right to be pissed?

TLDR; my boyfriend \[25M\] of 2 months won't tell me \[19F\] the company he works at even after I asked him twice, and I'm pissed and feel like he doesn't trust me or our relationship. Am I being overly sensitive?

t3_dle62t,I (20F) don‚Äôt know how to feel about this situation involving my ex (20M) and his feelings vs his actions.,"So basically I‚Äôm going to try to keep this as short as possible, but it might be hard. I (20F) was involved with someone who lives close to me (20M) our situation has been on and off for the last 2 years, many ups and many downs. Around 2 months ago, we had a major conflict which resulted in us no longer speaking. We had each other blocked on social media and moved on with our lives. Throughout this whole period of us knowing eachother, I confided in my best friend (22M) about what was going on and how I felt about everything. 

Fast forward to now, I had learned a lot from what we went through and I had grown as a person. I realized that throughout our whole time we knew each other we had both been in the wrong many times, it wasn‚Äôt completely one sided. I was starting to miss him a little, but I wasn‚Äôt about to go approach him or anything just yet. I was open to a reconciliation because I could see my growth and was hoping he had grown in the same way. After not seeing him for a really long time, I had started to notice he would stay around the area of my house and every single time I‚Äôd go outside he‚Äôd just be standing there, doing nothing. This happened countless times last week, he wouldn‚Äôt say anything but he‚Äôd just be standing there. It was obvious he was trying to make himself seem or let me know he was there, and I told my friend about this. 

Then two days ago I randomly got a text from the guy I was seeing. He said he was sorry for everything (even though he had already apologized back when everything went on) and I said I forgave him and that I was sorry for how I acted too. He asked me if I wanted to come over and I said yes. We ended up sleeping together, which complicated things further. Afterwards, we started talking and he said he still wasn‚Äôt sure if he wants to continue distancing himself from me or if he wants to be a part of my life. He kept apologizing profusely and said over and over he was sorry and that we were just supposed to talk and he wasn‚Äôt using me in any way shape or form. I made it clear to him that i‚Äôm open to reconciling with him or just being friends, but that I didn‚Äôt want to in any way impact his decision or make him feel forced into pursuing anything with me. He said something along the lines of ‚Äúif I text you, I text you. but if I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt. and I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù which kind of hurt me due to the fact I was under the impression that if I went over we‚Äôd be on good terms again, but I just said okay and went home. 

Then I confided in my male friend about this. I was just saying how I was kind of hurt by this and how I‚Äôm confused as to whether or not he‚Äôs going to distance himself, because I felt as if he wasn‚Äôt going to due to the fact he had been going out of his way to make himself seen just a few days prior. I talked a lot about this with his as he knows our history and knows how I feel about everything that‚Äôs went on. Today we were just talking, and he randomly says he decided to msg the guy I was with and see what was going on. This immediately upset me as he didn‚Äôt okay it with me first and I felt like it would cause unnecessary drama. This basically resulted in the guy I was with telling my friend he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me because he knows he‚Äôs just going to hurt me. He also
implied that he never really cared about me. This has happened before around a year or so ago, he acts like he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about me then I accept it and start moving on and then he starts doing weird shit like wait for me to come outside so I see him and then he goes on a tangent about how he does care he‚Äôs just not used to someone like me caring so much about him, just to get back into my life. Basically, the part I‚Äôm struggling with is, I don‚Äôt know what he wants from me here. He says he wants me out of his life but his actions show the exact opposite, you don‚Äôt go out of your way for someone in the way he does when you don‚Äôt care about them. I refuse to beg him to stay, but if I start moving on he‚Äôll start popping up again making himself known on purpose and it‚Äôs kind of exhausting. I don‚Äôt want to play these immature games, I just want him to be straightforward with me. I texted him before I even knew what was said between them as I wanted him to hear what I had to say FROM ME and said that I understand he goes through a lot but I‚Äôm still willing to be there for him because I care about as a friend, aside from all the feelings. I told him I want to be honest and straightforward with him but that I want the same in return, and that if he wants nothing to do with me it‚Äôs okay. He never responded to my text but decided to text my friend and tell him to fix it. My friend told him ‚Äúif you really want her to stay away from you you‚Äôre going to have to do your part and not make yourself known to her too‚Äù and he just said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just something she‚Äôs going to have to work with. She‚Äôs a strong woman‚Äù. then my friend said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want her then why are you always conveniently by her house or walking by her or hitting her up‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs making me sound like a stalker lol Anyways I agree with what you‚Äôre saying‚Äù basically ignoring the whole point. 

Basically, I‚Äôm as confused as ever. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs looking to gain here. It‚Äôs like usually people say they care, but their actions prove otherwise but this time it‚Äôs vice versa. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so easy for him to say he doesn‚Äôt care, just to take it back. My friend thinks he‚Äôs just trying to get me to beg for him back cause he‚Äôs an attention seeker and wants to place the blame on me if things go wrong again, but I just don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just upset because HE is the one who approached me, and now he‚Äôs saying that I‚Äôm the one who has to move on when that‚Äôs what I was doing. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to be apart of my life, yet he‚Äôs going out of his way to make himself apart of my life. I was moving on completely fine but then he starts things up again just to end them and it hurts. I don‚Äôt know what to think or feel and it sucks feeling like I‚Äôm the delusional one when I‚Äôm not even the one who reached out to him to begin with.  I don‚Äôt know what to do or how I should feel, or how I should even go about handling this. The part that‚Äôs bothering the most is him saying he doesn‚Äôt care, because nobody wants to feel as though one of the people you‚Äôve cared about most doesn‚Äôt feel any type of way back.",relationship_advice
t3_dlhjsu,My ex (19F) wants to get back together with me (20M),"My ex and I have been broken up for a year, during this time she's been dating another guy while I've been single. We go to the same college and we've been talking for the last few weeks. She told me that she wants to get back together and can't imagine herself with another guy, but she can't right now because she's dating someone else that she says she loves but doesn't want to hurt him right now. But she asked me to wait for her, and it's been really frustrating for me because I either want to take her back right now or move on and not be stuck in the middle. During this time, she made me promise to her that I wouldn't drink last weekend, but I did and she found out. She said she doesn't want to get back together anymore because she can't trust me anymore, but she later texted me saying she wanted to talk because she doesn't want to lose me over something small. At the same time, I'm having a hard time trusting her because she said she's ending things with her current boyfriend so we can start taking steps to rebuild our relationship but she sleeps over at his place everynight (I see her car parked outside his house everyday because we live right next to each other) and still continues to post him on her story. And she said that about 2 weeks ago, but it just seems like she's leading me on now and not actually doing anything so that we can get back together. I don't want to tell her to break up with her boyfriend because I don't want to seem like I'm forcing anything on her, but at the same time I'm tired of waiting for someone who is seeing someone else still. What should I do? Should I confront her about it or just keep waiting?",relationship_advice
t3_dl1do0,Do I (F30) apologies to a woman who I believe had an intimate friendship with my then bf now husband(M32)?,"There are a few details to layout but I will make this as short as possible. Husband and I were dating only a short while before he introduced me to his friends. One of those friends happened to be a woman who he was close with (we will call her Michelle). He has several female friends but this one was different. He seemed very intimate with her, she sent pics to him while she was in the dressing room asking what dressed looked the best, walked around in a bra around him when he would come over‚Ä¶just overall very close. On night we had a date where he and I met with his friends for an outing and she was there. Over the course of the night everyone starts to leave until the end where it is just my husband, Michelle, and I left. I run to the restroom and when I come back I see them dancing but his hands are on her hips holding her close to him. I thought this was just too much for me. I proceeded to tell him I felt uncomfortable with the amount on closeness he had with this friend, and he basically told me to deal with it. We broke up that night, I ubered home while he stayed at the bar with her.  The next morning he wanted to apologies. I met him at a place where we could talk and noticed a hickey on his neck. When I asked him where the hickey comes from, he says he couldn‚Äôt remember. Still to this day he says this. I said if we were to continue then their relationship would have to change, this was a boundary for me. He agreed and from then on he didn‚Äôt make any more contact with her. He was still polite and said hi when she was around but the texts and everything else just stopped. Fast forward to us moving past it, getting married, everything seemed ok. Well it all kind of came to a halt last Saturday. We were at a friend‚Äôs house and my husband was outside alone with one of his other female friend (who happens to be a good friend of Michelle)   and the next thing I know she comes back in the house and asks to talk to me. She then proceeds to tell me she‚Äôs upset that I don‚Äôt like Michelle and I need to get over ‚Äúmy issues‚Äù. She tells me there have been a few times where we have thrown some events and she asked if Michelle could come, she said my husband would tell her ‚Äúno because wife doesn‚Äôt like her‚Äù. I started to tell my side of the story and explain the night of the outing, and she tell me ‚Äúomg they are just friends, friends do that‚Äù ‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm sorry but no‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think that at all. I still believe in what I saw and felt that night and I‚Äôm now angry at my husband for throwing me under the buss like that. I would hope he would have just said ‚Äúno its best not to‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry no more space‚Äù or something other than making this a ‚Äúme issue‚Äù when we both agreed to this. There is an upcoming party that we will attend that Michelle will be at, and I have been told that it would be best if I apologies to her as she feels bad for me not liking her. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt think I should apologies as I still have not gotten the truth of what happened that night. Am I the asshole to set this boundary? Are my expectations unreasonable?  Should I apologies just to make peace with everyone?

t3_dlhe5o,Struggling [33F] to cope with my boyfriend's [28M] depression,"We've been together about a year, he moved in 3 months ago, shortly before we were in a semi-serious car crash (I was driving but it was completely not my fault, police are taking action against the other driver), he's not worked since (he's a self employed contractor in a physically demanding position, so he can't due to injuries - nothing serious just whiplash and back pain but enough that he can't do his job) which means he's had no money coming in for almost 3 months now. He's possibly burnt bridges with people who usually employ him by thinking he'd be OK by X date then cancelling quite last minute when he wasn't (more than once), so he has no future work lined up and it's now out of season for the work he does.

I am at work, I'm lucky in that I work salaried in an office so time I had off was fully paid and I had a supported return to work, I'm paying all the household expenses which he feels awful about and he won't accept any additional money. Myself and at least two of his friends have offered him loans, but he won't accept them.

In theory he should get his lost earnings back and an injury claim but we don't know when, all the solicitors can tell us is it's very early in the process so I'm assuming it's several more months at least.

I believe he has depression and to be honest I thought he did before the accident but now it's just getting much worse, he won't go to the doctors or seek any professional help and gets irate at the suggestion, but he'll often say he's done with life and everything and can't be fucked with anything which is worrying. While I'm at work he sits around the house watching TV, playing on his phone and napping, occasionally texting me about how shit he's feeling, he usually seems much better when I'm there but sometimes has just completely shut down. Unfortunately the sitting around doing nothing includes none of the household work so I get to work full time and come home and clean up after him, and I have a hard time not feeling like shit about this (I know he's not doing it because of his depression, I haven't complained once about this, I keep telling him it's fine, I'm here to support him. In truth the lack of him contributing money to the household doesn't really bother me, but I get really upset having to do all the housework too). 

Life sucks right now for both of us (for various reasons we're still without a vehicle, which means we can't do our hobbies or get out of the city, and when we've tried eg by friends giving us lifts he is left in loads of pain that shuts him down for a few days). He's not recovered anywhere near as well as I have, I assume this is due to our different treatment of it.

I have a long and serious history of depression, I've been on anti-depressants for 14 years, previously been hospitalised, etc and while I've been doing OK the last few years the difficulty with struggling with this on top of the repercussions of the accident are proving very difficult. The fact that I feel stuck trying to care for him at home when he doesn't want to do anything is also having a negative impact as I can't do things I know help me because I feel I have no free time (I can't do stuff after work because he'll be stuck at home even longer alone).

He's now talking about selling things he either needs for hobbies or needs for work to get some money, which I fear will only make it worse as he then can't do the things he loves once we I get my vehicle back and reduces his earning possibilities when he is fit enough. We were supposed to be going to an event this weekend, it's all paid for, now he's saying he isn't going because he can't afford it and I should go on my own - it costs exactly the same to go on my own as it does with him (the only cost still to pay is fuel, which costs the same whether or not I have a passenger), plus I don't want to go without him - it's all his friends we're going with and it would just be weird for me to go on my own, I don't want to not go though - we've already bought tickets, accommodation, booked a hire vehicle etc note of which is refundable. I've been really looking forward to it and I thought he was too (he's been talking about it for about 6 months), it's the first time he'll have been able to see most people we're going with since before the accident, and there'll be dozens of other people going he knows so considering that he talks about how rarely seeing anyone but me and how isolated he feels it would be insane and detrimental not to attend this event.

He reacts negatively to anything anyone tries to suggest might help him, has asked me not to ask him how he's feeling because it just makes him feel worse and other than just trying to be there for him I don't know what to do to help. I know he needs to help himself but how do I facilitate an environment where he does that because I can't continue the way we are at the moment. He is much better at doing positive things if he does them completely himself without anyone telling or suggesting it to him.

t3_dlhdwa,Did I do the right thing?,"I (17M) recently broke up with my boyfriend (18M) of 7 months and I genuinely can't tell if it was the right thing to do or if I over reacted to a small fight. The break up convo started after one night when I was exhausted after class and decided to go to bed early. He and I usually called before bed nightly but I sent him a quick ""gn ily, goin to bed early"" text. Next morning he called me a dick and that he was upset that I didnt stay up to call him. I didnt know how to respond so I just apologized. For some background info, I have a diagnosed panic disorder and sometimes he would purposefully mess me until I had a panic attack and then make me feel bad for having them and he acted like he was doing me a favor for helping me through the panic attacks he caused. Another thing that happened was that he knew that I didnt like when he talked about his best friend because, before we had started dating, the two of them were friends with benefits but I specifically said I didnt have a problem with them being friends, just that the topic made me uncomfortable. He had a tendency to talk about him and when I would just give 1 word answers when he talked about him. He sent me this https://imgur.com/a/ZpMZEm1 which made me really uncomfortable.
We got into a huge fight over all of this and he kept swinging back and forth from ""I love you"" to ""You're a fucking asshole""

t3_dld1o1,What's Fair and Not Fair to Ask of Someone in a Relationship,"My boyfriend and I were together for 3 years and broke up due to personal problems we had to deal with within ourselves. We recently got back together after 3 months apart and in that time he told me that he had sex with someone at his work (he works at a bar). He regretted it very much and has since removed the girl from all social media/avoids her at work. I too have engaged in intimate stuff with other people and dated others, and he knows this. We haven't been upset at each other about those things because we both admitted we never thought we would see each other again or get back into a relationship. In knowing this, it does bother me that he had sex with someone he works with for the reason that he may still see her from time to time - it's a massive bar/pub, but still.

 He is wanting to find another job and I've been encouraging him to do this (for obvious reasons), but it got me thinking - is it fair of me to want him to get another job and away from his current work? Is it fair of me to say that if he doesn't, it will be a problem for me to make progress in rebuilding our relationship knowing he still occasionally runs into someone he had sex with while we were apart? He understands how I feel about this and assures me he wants to move work anyway, but I still feel kind of guilty encouraging him to move knowing it's mostly because I want him to since it makes me uncomfortable he is still there.

t3_dlf3j7,My male friend wants to get back with his toxic ex,"So basically there's a group of 8 of us (a clique) and this male friend from our clique (let's call him Harry) who got together with a girl (let's call her Grace) in our clique as well.

Their relationship lasted for one month, it was on &amp; off. Within that period of time, they've broken up FOUR TIMES over things that are incredibly minor. Their relationship also caused the clique to be separated into two because Grace for some reason, started disliking some of us in the clique for some other reasons.

Grace is a huge hypocrite. She's also spoilt, disrespectful and full of herself. She full-on scolded her parents for buying her a different flavor of ice cream instead of the one she liked.. She also likes to put other people down &amp; insult their looks.. 

So the rest of the clique finally had enough and cut off all ties with her, but she kept in contact with this guy in the clique (let's call him John) and pestered him to tell her what the rest of us are saying about her and also everything that's going on with Harry.

It has been a few months since Harry and Grace broke it off for good and the separated clique has united once more (with the exception of Grace) but yesterday, Harry messaged the groupchat and told us he misses Grace and wants her back and that he had also tried to talk to her prior messaging us.

I know I can't make Harry's decisions for him but I really don't want him to get hurt by Grace anymore.. and neither do I want the clique to fall apart again once they break up. What should I do? Please help. 

Feel free to clarify with me your doubts as I know this whole situation is super complicated and I might not have explained it well.

t3_dlf23p,"My ex boyfriend‚Äôs new girlfriend messaged me asking for his clothes back, how should I handle this?","This is honestly such a weird fucking situation, and I need some help. I (18f) broke up with my ex boyfriend (18m) about 6 months ago. There was a lot that contributed towards it, distance, going too fast for me, his trust issues, etc. I spent a lot of time trying to talk everything out with him but it got to be too much. He was my first relationship, but his life was already so grown up and difficult and I couldn‚Äôt keep up. I felt like I was making his emotional problems worse, so I ended it. It was a drawn out breakup, very painful. He was my first love, so it wasn‚Äôt easy for me. I didn‚Äôt want him to hate me, or for me to become another one of his terrible, cheating ex stories. But I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs too late for that because I am now dating an old friend that he was worried about. I realize how scummy it sounds, I feel bad about it often, but there was no overlap. I didn‚Äôt even start liking him until after my breakup. He was there for me and supportive, and I realized how much I missed having that during the weeks of constant validation. I‚Äôm sorry, this is just backstory. Months ago, he messaged me several times asking when he could come pick up his clothes. He left a couple of hoodies, a shirt, and some joggers here. I told him whenever he could, and offered to bring them to him. He refused, and said he would tell me when he could pick them up. Well that never happened. Cut to now, and someone I don‚Äôt recognize tries to send me an Instagram dm. Lo and behold, it‚Äôs his new girlfriend. Asking if I still have his clothes. 6 months after he was meant to get them. I tell her yes, he can get them whenever, and again, offer to bring them. She asks when I can bring them, I tell her I‚Äôll let her know. So now I‚Äôm sitting here, at 1 am, jittery and filled with an emotion I don‚Äôt know the name of. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm angry or sad or just confused. At this point I‚Äôm about 100% certain she just messaged me so that I‚Äôd see pictures of them together. I‚Äôm mad at myself for offering to drive an hour and a half to bring him his clothes, considering part of the strain on our relationship was me always having to go to him. I guess my question is, what do I do now? Should I follow through with my offer to bring his clothes there? I do not want to see either of them, and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôd be there or if I could just leave them outside. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want them coming here either. But I know how much he and his family struggled financially, at least when I knew him. So I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs been missing these few pieces of clothing. I also have a painting he did at my house that he really liked, should I give that back too or would it be weird? I also have a candy bag from our first date that I‚Äôve kept, I kind of want to put that in there too, but if I‚Äôm being honest it would be a purely petty move.

Ofcourse I didn‚Äôt understand anything of that and brought her back to my place asap. She then opened up about still messaging her ex and still having feelings for him even though she is madly in love with me. Before we started dating she even told him to not go out with another girl because she would be waiting for him. She felt so bad about herself and was so confused that she eventually she called quits on us and went to a friends place and told me she will call me later this week. I am freaking heartbroken right now and I don‚Äôt know what to do at all except just keep crying. I finally opened up my heart after my last relationship of 3 years and being single for 2 and then life just slaps you right back in the face.",relationship_advice
t3_dlc5mf,"How come sometimes when you're irritated for no apparent reason, and you're asked if you're okay, it just makes it all the more worse?","Yep, okay, I'm irritated. Don't know why, just am. I don't even know if this goes here truth be told. 

I'm 22f and he's 24m, and we just got into a tiff because of this and how I reacted, but I'm even more annoyed at it since he told me ""No, it's just you"" that reacts the way I do. 

I find that hard to believe, but now I'm doubting myself and think there's actually something wrong with me.

Was going to sit outside for a bit before I shower, so I told him that. He asked if I was fine, and I just said ""I'm irritated right now and would rather go outside than shower"". And he just, didn't hear me. Could be the fact I didn't say it loud enough, or the fact I was getting my sweatshirt so I wasn't facing him. 

The fact that I had to repeat myself though just made the irritated-unwelcomed-without-a-reason feeling all the more worse. I just repeated what I said, louder, maybe more attitude (I don't really know because I cannot actually hear it within myself when and if I do).  

And I just got ready and went outside. He actually proceeded to come outside him to tell me ""If you're in a bad mood, could you at least warn me before hand so you don't end up ruining my mood and night. You've done this 3 night in a row now"". I said that I did tell him, he just didn't hear me, and he went back inside. 

I came him to put something in the closet and I asked what he meant I did this 2 other nights. He didn't really give me an example when asked ""when"", but apparently I did. I explained that I don't think I'm the only one when in a shitty mood, and asked a question, they get more bothered, or even asked to repeat themselves they get even more bothered. 

He just straight up told me ""No, it's just you"". Am I really that alone? He told me he knows no one else that reacts the way I do, and he knows more people than I do so he knows. Should I get help or something?",relationship_advice
t3_dlf1hm,My(18m) Girlfriend(19f) is Slowly Getting More Suicidal,"I just came back after a weekend of visiting my girlfriend. Things were really good until a few hours before I left. While I slept I woke up to her crying quietly. This happened maybe 4-5 times during 8 hours. During those times I would try to comfort her (even though I was half awake) only for it to happen again some time after. And after I left things only got worse. She was in a bad mood and always denied it when I asked her what was on her mind. 

For the past year and a half (basically when she started college), my gf has been getting suicidal thoughts. And hearing that hurt. A lot. And I hate the fact that hearing this wasnt  that surprising to me. The biggest factor for this is for sure her parents. Specifically her mom. All her life receiving positive reinforcement from her parents was a myth. Yes she would congratulate on graduation or at the end of semesters, but it was very short lived and seemed to have little effect too. This is because, in another post by me, the mom is straight up abusive. I wont go into detail again but heres the jist of it. My GF was neglected most of her life with few exceptions, her mom rarely showed any affected to her, the mom played WoW so much that almost every day she was 30 minutes late to pick her up (they live like 5 minutes away), is always bashing gf hard for mistakes (told her she'll never be a good wife for missing the dishes ONCE), did not teach her jack shit about adulthood or cleaning, and that's barely scratching the surface. What I'm saying Is she was a shit mom and my girlfriend is only now starting to realize it. And to make matters worse my gf has a extremely bad insecurity issue. I get it, we all have insecurities, but she takes the cake. She will never go out and say and likes what shes wearing. She will never compliment herself about anything. She hates her body with a passion. And she told me she almost never believes any compliments I give her. Her school makes things worse too. Probably 2-3 all nighters a week. All of this put together only makes a recipe for disaster. In my 4 years with her I've tried to hard to make her happy, to make her love herself, to make herself at least give a pat on the back for her accomplishments, but alas nothing happens. Atleast it's only temporary. And it feels like it's only gotten worse. And now I can only do so much when shes a 2 hour drive away and I can only limited amount of weekends. In between those I pray that I wont wake up to find out she killed herself. I really try to help. I cant stress that enough. But it's like nothing I do works. She cant take therapy because of the costs and she doesnt even have time to breathe because of school. It feels like I'm being backed up into a corner as a grow up until I'm forced to off myself. I'm running out of options here and it's scary. 


Things suck. I hope I dont her. But maybe I'm the one not good enough. And I'll be lying if I told you I havent thought of killing myself too. If this gets lost and people never read this I'm honestly okay with that. But if you took your valuable time to read what I have to say, thank you. It means a lot to me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlf0t1,My girlfriend(17F) and I(17M) barely spend time together and I'm not sure where this relationship is going.,"Some backstory, we have been in the same class from 7-10 and changed schools for 11 and 12, so we cant see each other at school.

My girlfriend of 7 months lives about 30 minutes away from me. We skype and watch shows together often but have never gone out by ourselves, mainly because she wants to save money as much as possible. Our parents have some idea about us and are against it, therefore we haven't confirmed anything with them. The only time I meet her is when we go out with our 10th grade class friends which is about once every 2 months or so.

Furthermore, It is very likely that we will be attending college in different countries, which means at least 4 years of not seeing each other at all. 

I dont think I can last through all that time, while still being unsure if we can find a way to get together in the future. 

Does this relationship have no future?

t3_dleygz,"I broke up ages ago, and I need to get over her. Please help, she's all I think about.","So, basically, I am 18 and male. She is 18 and female, obviously (we'll call her N). Never had a relationship prior to her, just crushes and several friendzonings.

Me and N got together in July of this year, and broke up at the end of August for a myriad of reasons. We were both 17 when we got in a relationship with each other.

N's had many a relationship prior to me, she was my first relationship, and she was amazing. She made me happier than I had been in months.

N was irritatingly more into her friend's (We'll call him J) relationship. He was having issues with his GF and she was all like ""oh no, this is bad for him, you (me) can't do anything to help, but I'll tell you all about it nearly everyday"" which made me feel useless. We went our separate ways with the intention to get back together once her drama had stored itself out.

So, since the breakup in August, the end of August to the middle of September was a struggle for me as I had a seriously difficult time getting over her. That subsided for a while towards the end of September and beginning of October.

Unfortunately, them feelings have come back. They've come back hard.

The other day, N told me she was pregnant. It's her last boyfriend's baby, not mine, I am still a virgin. She's 34 weeks. It's a noticeably big bump. Surprised like nobody at school bar people she's told have put 2 and 2 together.

I've started feeling for N again, which is a bitch because she doesn't really want anything at all to do with me. She barely acknowledges me unless she absolutely has to. I've offered my support for her and the baby, but I can tell she doesn't want me to. 

But, not long after we broke up in August, I met this new girl and started to have a crush on her. She's 17. (We'll call her D)


So, to simplify:

(???) N got pregnant without knowing it with her boyfriend before me

(Early July) Me and N got together

(July-August) Me and N were in a relationship, and J started having relationship issues

(End of August) Me and N broke up for good, I said I didn't want to get back with her

(September) felt really sad, met D and developed a crush

(Late September) started getting over her

(October) started feeling for her again, N found out she was pregnant

(Earlier this week) N tells me about the baby, and what she's doing with her life moving forward. I'm not gonna be in it very much.

(Today) I'm making this post, looking for help to get over her once and for all.


So, what do I do. I feel like I've moved on too fast with liking D not that long after me and N broke up, but I'm not over N yet, so I haven't really. 

I like D, I think she's sweet and cute and nice, but I don't know where to go with her, or how to get there. We've had a few conversations, but it's always me reaching out to her first.

r/relationship_advice... Please help me get over N. This post has sprouted off into so many tangents, I'm sorry about that.

t3_dlgzsu,My (f18) parents hate my (m18) boyfriend.,"My parents are convinced my boyfriend of 8 months who I deeply adore doesn't treat me right. I understand parents have concerns for their children, especially daughters (I know I hate it as well, having an older brother and being treated differently due to gender is annoying but I understand to some degree) however, my boyfriend treats me with the utmost respect and does nothing to hurt me. He hates when I am upset and does anything and everything he can to make me happy which I am so thankful for. With this in mind, you wonder why my parents hate him? well so do I honestly. 

Now to preface, my parents are boomers. We have many conflicting opinions due to our age gap which puts a major strain on our relationship which I have tried to fix multiple times. I try very hard to take everything they say with a grain of salt but the majority of the things they say are verbal attacks to me and my interests, which I am not allowed to fight back on because to quote:

 ""You have not experienced enough of life to have an opinion on anything"" (context of this quote came up when there was a conversation at dinner about inequality...ironic).

I absolutely love and adore my boyfriend and this goes both ways. We don't argue and if we do disagree on something we talk about it and come to a mutual agreement. We make efforts to see each other when we can (which isn't that often due to our schedules and the distance to each other's houses). All-round we are happy and love each other dearly and plan for this relationship to last which I honestly think it will. I don't tell my bf what my parents think about him, he has a feeling they don't like him and does try hard to get them to but his efforts seem to fall flat. I really don't want any stress put on him about their opinion on him because it doesn't affect my views on our relationship at all and because the majority of the things they say to me are facts they are pulling out of their ass to gaslight me. It is, however, getting to a point of discomfort for me. I don't want to keep having to lie to my boyfriend that my parents do like him so he doesn't freak out and I also don't want to have my parents keep telling me horrible things about my relationship that aren't true because they do upset me.

 Any advice on how to deal with this would be amazing and greatly appreciated. I will also answer any questions asked about this if you need more info, thank you. :)

t3_dlju7l,Being nice in relationship gets me friendzoned everytime.,"I (M25) is always nice to girls around me. Let's say I take them out, talk to them, tries to understand them. I'm nice to them they're nice to me. One day I say I'm interested then I'm immediately friendzoned. Now, I accept rejection and try to move on, they say I'm ruining our friendship because of my expectations. Let me make it clear, everytime they make feel like an asshole because I kinda ruined our friendship by expressing my feelings/interest on them, or ruined it by moving on. Some of them literally asked me whether I would stop caring them the same way after rejecting me. Sometimes I just feel so empty after meeting them just remembering they're not interested in me. This has happened to me with almost all the girls I've been with. These days I feel characterless beacuse these things have a strong impact on my self esteem and confidence. I have seen so many good relationships and doubt myself everytime whether I really need to change and just be like the guy who has a good relationship. I don't know why a good relationship matters so much to me at this point of time. But I feel complete when I'm with a girl who really respects my feelings and cares me.

t3_dldmx7,I (f 27) undermined my husband‚Äôs (30) authority so now he is giving me the silent treatment,"My husband and I‚Äôs son is four. He‚Äôs very sweet but can be a little wild. I know that I may spoil him, but I just have a soft spot for him. It‚Äôs hard for me to see him cry or look upset. My husband has no trouble with that though.

Tonight we were eating dinner and my son threw a piece of food at me. I just softly told him not to do that, and he just did it again. My husband was watching me to see if I‚Äôd do anything, but I just didn‚Äôt. So my husband said something to him. He stopped for several minutes and then did it again. My husband told him to go to his room. I said ‚Äúno baby you can stay‚Äù. I just thought it was too harsh, to me he‚Äôs just a baby and I really didn‚Äôt mind. My husband glared at me and then repeated himself, and my son did listen.

As soon as he left my husband just started going in on me. He told me that I was going to create a monster, and he said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going to happen when he grows up?‚Äù. I tried to defend myself but he told me to just listen. He said that I am the one home with him most of the day so I have to start being a mother.

t3_dldlar,I found out my wife was keeping a secret,"My (M27) wife (F27) just told me that before we were together she slept with another man while he was married. I won't dive into the details much but he was in a position of authority and took advantage of the situation when she was only 19 by threatening to tell our entire church that she came onto him. He was our worship leader and the pastors son. Her friend went through the same situation with him around the same time. 
I don't mind her past much because I feel everyone has a past and we learn and grow. I had never known any of this until this weekend, what I am upset about and confused on is we have been married for 7 years and he had texted her and reached out on several occasions but she never told me. She says that she shut him down and never did anything while we have been married but she never told me once, that he was making moves on her and on one occasion she was pregnant with our son.
A little back story to why I'm hurt and confused. I have only been with 2 women. When my wife and I had first moved in together 7 years ago my ex had a family member die, he mom couldn't get ahold of and didn't have social media so I messaged her just saying ""so and so dies, call your mom. I'm sorry for the loss."" I showed my wife and she freaked out saying it was the same as cheating. Since that point she has been on me about not using social media and outright accused me of cheating a few times, which I have not. She would check my phone and freak out if we watched a movie and a sex scene came on. This was typical behavior. With all that said I'm frustrated, hurt and confused. I don't know if she actually sexted or hooked up with this guy while we've been married and I'm more hurt she never told me he texted/called her. She said she acted this way because didn't want to me turn into, so I've basically paid for this guy's mistakes for 7 years.

t3_dleoka,I (20M) am almost 99% sure my girlfriend (20F) is/has been cheating on me for the duration of our relationship,"So I have been with this girl for about 2 months now, we‚Äôve known each other for 5 years now, both had a crush on each other our senior year of high school, and then obviously two months ago started dating after about a month of seeing each other as friends/interests. Before we started dating, once this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù she has from a nearby city sent her a nude on SC, in which she opened, as I don‚Äôt think she knew what it would be, and then in the chat attachments section it showed that she too, had been sending her nudes. At that point, obviously I was weirded out as literally the day before we had talked about becoming a couple, but I just passed it off as, okay, we‚Äôre not dating, I guess this is fine? Throwback to a week ago, she went to a concert/show in that same city, so she told me she was staying at this same persons place with her roommate. Okay, surely, she wouldn‚Äôt cheat or do anything, I trust her, whatever. Does not talk to me the entire time she is there, once again, it doesn‚Äôt matter, I just want her to have a good time. We had plans for the day after, and things that day were very weird. I get picked up by her and her roommate as they just got back in town, and her roommate doesn‚Äôt say a word to me, which is very off-kilter because we usually get along, we joke a lot usually, laugh, etc. But nothing was said by her whatsoever, but my girlfriend is entirely fine, talking normally, nothing is strange. We usually do things, make plans to actually get out and do something, but she just wanted to stay home and sleep, which is cool w me, I just want to be with her so I‚Äôm happy with it. I stay up a little bit as I have a really hard time falling asleep usually, and I notice she is on the exact opposite side of the bed from me, turned away, and I‚Äôm not 100% sure she was actually sleeping? This is where I start to wonder if things are okay, if she‚Äôs okay, if she‚Äôs thinking about anything, but I just fall asleep instead of saying anything, as at that point it was 2AM. Things are okay the next day, but her roommate still won‚Äôt talk to me. 

Fast forward to about a week later, she begins to act very cold. We start to see each other less, she starts wanting to talk less, which I don‚Äôt say anything because she has a busy life, sometimes things come up. On the Friday of that week, after staying over at her house, she breaks up with me, saying she can‚Äôt handle a relationship right now, doesn‚Äôt give an exact reason but just says she wasn‚Äôt ready for it. I‚Äôm heartbroken but I just say it‚Äôs okay, I just want her to be happy. I leave, walk home crying, and she texts me saying sorry, she still wants to be with me, she wanted to ‚Äúprotect me‚Äù from her, which I‚Äôm unsure what that means, until I connect it a few minutes after reading, and I say yes, of course, let‚Äôs get back together, because once again, I just want her to be happy. Then the next day, we had plans to go meet her family in a nearby town, which was a very strange concept for me after the previous days events. We did, had a lovely time, except she kept asking me if I was okay, unlike I hadn‚Äôt been broken up with the day before ?? Then, for Halloween, we had plans to go to *That friends Halloween party, and I ask if we still plan to go together, and she tells me she‚Äôs still thinking about it.

t3_dlgngh,I (F23) and one of my best friends (M24) have been hooking up for the last 3 months and we never really talked about it. I think I‚Äôm falling for him but he sends me mixed signals and I can‚Äôt really figure out what he thinks/feels. Should I initiate ‚Äúthe conversation‚Äù?,"In the beginning he texted me every day, sometimes more than once, I could tell he was making an effort to talk to me, even when we had nothing to talk about. Whenever we were together he was super sweet and affectionate, he decided to loose his virginity to me (don‚Äôt know if it means something but...) and he actually told me a couple of times things like ‚ÄúI like you a lot‚Äù and ‚Äúlove you‚Äù. Even told me once, not directly, that he felt like he could eventually start to like me in a different way.

One month ago, I stared to notice he was acting different. He still calls me babe, princess and etc., and we still end up hugging, kissing and etc. whenever we are together (with our other 2 best friends, we are a group of 3 guys and 1 girl). But he doesn‚Äôt really texts me anymore. He still replies to my Instagram stories just messing with me sometimes but even when we talk he doesn‚Äôt make the same effort when the conversation is ‚Äúdying‚Äù. 

So, as you can probably tell, I‚Äôm super confused and super sad about the situation. Two weeks ago, we were chatting on Instagram dms and I lost it and told him I would like to talk about what happened between us. He told me he could talk but never really touched the subject again. We have been together after that and he acted normal, hugged me, kissed me, we had sex, etc.. This makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt want to have the conversation, but I feel like I can‚Äôt keep doing this without knowing what he wants and feels. 

It you can read him and understand his actions better than I can pls just give me your honest opinion. Is he trying to not have this conversation? Should I ask him again to talk about it? Will he think I like him if I do?",relationship_advice

t3_dlgmbp,My (20F) good friend and soon to be roommate (21F) is going through problems.,"Hi all. This might be long 

My best girl friend has a pretty tragic backstory. We can call her Elsa. She was adopted as her birth parents were druggies and would inject her and her sisters with heroin to make them sleep when they cried. She was also raped at the age of 4 by her birth father. She got adopted when she was 5 (along with her sister who‚Äôs 1 year older) and her current family is great, though they‚Äôre helicopter parents. 

My friend has supposedly slept with between 50 and 150 people. She states she lost track and thinks it‚Äôs in that range. She desperately wants a relationship but she always settles for FWB and gets upset when I suggest that‚Äôs not the way to go about getting into a relationship. I‚Äôm all for casual sex and FWB deals, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it looks like it‚Äôs really harming her lately and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs how she should seek out a romantic relationship. 

She moves in with me in January to my townhouse (right now it‚Äôs just me) but has a mattress here. Two days ago I came in and walked into her room and she was under the covers cuddling with my other friend, let‚Äôs call him John. John is very emotionally vulnerable and prone to developing feelings. My roommate, Elsa, does not care about John and only met him 4 days ago (now) when he was helping me move some furniture. She is using him as a rebound over the last guy who ended things over this past weekend and it really hurts because this is my friend and I don‚Äôt want things to become awkward. John‚Äôs roommate Alex, and my boyfriend Jack also see what‚Äôs going on and are upset over the inevitable awkwardness to come in friend gatherings. 

However, my perspective changed last night when she came into my room and told me she withdrew from several classes and has decided to see a psychiatrist because she believes she‚Äôs bipolar like her birth father and wants to stop her behavior. She said her and John were just hanging out because she was feeling suicidal but it doesn‚Äôt exactly seem that way and I‚Äôm still upset, but also how can I be upset with her for seeking comfort? 

Overall, how do I handle this friendship? She‚Äôs extremely abrasive so I have to avoid being confrontational around her. But I love her and she matters to me and I want to do something. I just kind of suck at the human/empathy thing and don‚Äôt know exactly what to do or say to her.",relationship_advice

t3_dlarsy,Myself (19 m) found a new friend group and with a new crush (18 f) but am unsure how to proceed.,"To set up the scenario, my friends and I go to a university in my hometown and as such I know a lot of people there. Still I was a very introverted person, graduated high school a year early, and only kept in contact with a couple close friends of 4+ years. Through my entire first year of university I barely talked to anyone, and sparsely went to club activates, (overall just felt really poorly socially, even worse than highschool). This year one of my close friends started attending my University and met a few girls from his classes that he started talking to regularly, which in turn led to me hanging out with them semi regularly, as well. I've felt much better these past couple months, and find myself actually driven to hang out with them instead of staying cooped up at home. Issue is I've found that I grew a crush on one of the girls and have no idea what to do. We semi-cuddled together when watching TV with the group, and I really enjoy her company specifically but am worried that trying to pursue a relationship could result in a total disaster with the entire group not wanting to interact with me anymore and me going back to just going to school and then home everyday. I'm in completely uncharted territory for myself, and have no idea what I should do, so any advice is appreciated!

t3_dlarst,"My(22f) father (64m) made an ass of himself at my wedding, and I'm not sure I can forgive him.","So, my father is a pretty standard racist white dude living in the south. Its caused plenty of fights between us, and I probably would have cut contact with him by now if it weren't for my mother, who I have a great relationship with and is nothing like him. 

He has a habit of acting out at social events in the past in order to draw attention to himself (including my cousin's wedding last year) so I was kind of nervous, especially with the fact that our officiant (one of our best friends) is a black guy. I just knew he would have something to say. I was reluctant to even invite him, but being as my whole family was going to be there I felt obligated to have him walk me down the aisle. I guess I thought he would be able to get it together for his daughter's wedding. 

I had multiple people, including my mother and his sister talk to him weeks before, telling him what was expected of him. He seemed on board and I thought all was well.

Fast forward to the day of, late September. I rode with the officiant and my bridesmaids to the venue and saw my father standing outside with two of my uncles. I hung back and let my friends walk in first to make sure my fiance wouldn't see me before the big moment. I stepped out of the car and approached my father, expecting him to be a little teary-eyed at the sight of his daughter in her wedding dress. Instead, I see his eyes look in the direction of my officiant, and he looks back at me and says, ""I'm glad you arent marrying a N____"" I'm sure you all can fill in the blanks.

I was livid. I had been putting up with his shit for years and years in order to keep the peace and in that moment I just snapped and said, ""Don't start that fucking shit here."" He was clearly upset at being called out, walked away mumbling about how no one can take a joke anymore. He walked me down the aisle but he was completely stone-faced the entire time, and he didn't approach me for the remainder of the ceremony, and left without saying anything.

We haven't spoken since, but I have been trying to maintain a relationship with my mother still. Every time we speak she asks when my father and I will make up and I keep telling her that its up to him, he needs to come to me and apologize and then we can go from there. However, he isn't going to apologize because he doesn't think he did anything wrong, but I refuse to apologize and honestly I stand by what I said at the wedding. (Please note this is only something I am considering for the sake of my mother.)
With the holidays approaching, my mother is bringing it up more and more. I don't think she can bare the thought of me not coming home for Thanksgiving and Christmas. She even tried to bargain with me today, asking if I'd let it go if he tried to talk to me but not apologize. I said absolutely not.
Reddit, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place here. Do I let it go and compromise my values and risk a future blow out? Do I wait it out, miss the holidays, and cause my mother to resent me? Some third option I'm not thinking of????",relationship_advice
t3_dlgknu,I [16M] like two girls [16F and 16F] and want to ask both of them out what do I do?,"I tried posting this on r/relationships but they didn't want me so this is copy and pasted.

I'm going to try and keep this short because I'm on my phone and typing with a small keyboard is hard so obligatory apology about spelling and grammar.

As mentioned in the title I'm 16 and I go to high school with these two girls that I like. My problem is that I want to ask one of them out but I don't know which one.

The first girl has been my friend for more than a year now which seems great but that's the problem. People say that 'girls don't date guys they're friends' with and that 'you should ask a girl out before you know her too well' which is my problem. I really like her but having been good friends with her for more than a year it seems weird to ask her out because I also don't want to ruin the the friendship. Also she has had two other boyfriends and this would be my first relationship so I feel a little under-qualified.

The second girl only moved to my school this year (I live in Australia btw do we're nearly at the end of our school year) but I met her right away and we knew each other for a while but not very well. That is until the second semester when we had biology together so we became better friends. She's not my closest friend because our biology teacher is a bit of a bitch and we can't talk a lot in class (we walk home the same way though so we get to talk more then) but I like her and all that stuff about asking girls out before you know them very well applies better with her.

So that's my problem, I know it doesn't make a lot of sense, but, I like two girls and want to ask one of them out. Also I guess I lied about keeping it short, sorry.

t3_dl7y8p,I'm growing increasingly suspicious of my [25M] girlfriend's [23F] friendship with her coworker [M30],"Alright, so I'll dive right into this.

Brief background: I've been with my girlfriend since we were in our late-teens; around 6-7 years.  She currently lives with her parents and I live with mine, though we see each other once or twice a week and most weekends.  Anyway, onto recent events.  

My girlfriend started a new job earlier this year and ended up getting on well with one of her male coworkers.  They eventually exchanged numbers (which I was made aware of) to chat outside of work, though she had exchanged numbers with a few of her coworkers, so no real alarm bells there. 

Several weeks later, she ends up being rotated to a different workplace within the same company.  Consequently, she no longer sees this male coworker on a daily basis.  However, they continued to text most evenings outside of work.  One day she tells me that her and this guy had arranged to meet for an hour or so after work for drinks, as they hadn't seen each other for a while and wanted to catch up.  I found this a little weird, but whatever.  I'm not her keeper.  When she got back that evening, she told me that they had drinks, then had a quick meal too.  Again, found this weird, but I powered through it.

Fast forward another few weeks and they have now arranged to go on a night out together into town.  She told me that she hadn't been into town drinking before and that this guy was going to show her some of the best bars.  It was here that my suspicions were really growing.  I asked her if anyone else was going and she said it was just her and him.  I wasn't very happy about it, but I didn't kick up too much of a fuss, and off she went that evening.  

She came back at around midnight, only slightly drunk and said that she had a good night but the other guy ended up quite drunk and she had to guide him back to a place to get a cab.  Other than that, he apparently didn't do anything inappropriate and they had fun.

Continue on a few more weeks and she tells me that she's going to this guy's house after work to help him decorate.  This was her choice and he seemingly hadn't asked her for help; she offered to help him.  She was at his place for around 3 hours before she text me saying she got home.  She showed me pictures of the decorating they'd done (so I guess there's truth to that at least).  Not even two weeks later she ends up going to this guy's place AGAIN.  Apparently, on this visit they ate pizza together and played a board game.  

Because of my suspicions I ended up snooping on her texts when she came around to my place this past weekend.  They have texted a LOT over the last couple of months.  We're talking around 3,000 texts.  However, to my surprise, aside from some pretty bad occasional innuendo and lots of venting about work, there was nothing too incriminating.  No evidence of sexting from either side and the other guy isn't saying anything I'd consider disrespectful either.

Which brings me to today.  Currently, we're on holiday abroad.  We went to a bar together this evening and she got moderately drunk.  I've stayed mostly sober, though.  When she fell asleep, I checked her phone again (yes, I know I shouldn't be doing this).  She's been texting the guy intermittently throughout the evening.  Again, nothing massively inappropriate in the texts (mostly about where she is and what we're doing), but I've noticed that now she's putting ""xx"" on the end of some of her messages, though he hasn't reciprocated it.  

I'm at a bit of a loss here.  I know how this probably looks from the outside, but I do genuinely trust my girlfriend and would like to believe that nothing is going on.  

Am I being a fool here?  

Thank you all in advance for any advice",relationship_advice
t3_dlggmp,Don't know how to handle this situation... I [20F] fell for a guy [38M] who is MARRIED,"Hello everyone,

I never thought I'd be in this position but I am very very confused and don't really know what to do. A few months ago (around July) this guy started to DM me on Twitter. I replied and we managed to sustain an amazing conversation and we felt like we had a lot in common. Crazily, we are both from EXACTLY the same town - it's quite a small town in rural England, so the odds of randomly speaking to someone online and them being from here too is very small. Even though we do have a huge age gap, I didn't mind as our conversations were effortless and he made me feel how no other man has before. He showered me with compliments all the time, made me feel special and I was really enjoying things. We were taking things slow.... just chatting about general life, our work, hobbies and interests, until one day, about a month after we first started talking, he asked if I want to meet. I told him I'm not ready to meet someone I've only ever spoken to online in person yet, and that I still want to know more about him. He was fine with this. Naturally, bringing up the topic of meeting for a date led us onto the discussion of relationships. I asked him why he was still single at 38 and he said that he had been married, which he called ""the worst mistake of his life"" and that he was still ""paying the price for it now."" I didn't push it further, but a few days later curiosity got the better of me and I asked him more about his marriage. Well it turns out he is STILL married, but counts himself as single in his own eyes. And the reason why he won't leave? He has two 10 year old kids. To say I was shocked was an understatement. I was disgusted at myself for talking to and falling for someone who went to sleep next to another woman - his wife! - every night. So I stopped talking to him, he said he respected my decision and for a few weeks we had no contact.

Then, in mid-September, certain events happened in my life that caused me to feel very, very low and depressed. I retweeted something reflecting my current state of mind at the time and he DMed me again, asking how I was. Against my better judgment, since I was so lonely and so down, I replied and we struck up conversation once again. He told me he loved me, he couldn't stop thinking about me and that he truly thinks I'm the dream girl for him. He was also there for me, and really helped me during my tough time. He also explained his ""situation"" more - that he would love to divorce his wife and would marry me tomorrow if he could, but that whenever he brought up the idea his kids reacted badly and that he couldn't do that to them. He told me all he wanted was some closeness, intimacy, that I'm his dream woman, that it must be the most difficult test of his life to have me right there but not be able to commit to me fully. He asked me if I'd like to meet and I said no again, not until his situation is resolved. Eventually, his kids will get to an age where they're adult and mature enough to understand the situation (they're 10 now), and he said he would leave her then. I remained sceptical though. I said that surely your wife must still have feelings for you? He remained insistent that they rarely spoke, argued all the time and only kept up appearances for the kids. But with each passing day, despite my growing scepticism, I fell for him more and more. I was becoming attached to him, and talking to him became like a daily part of my routine. I told him I wouldn't pursue a relationship with him until he is FULLY single, should that day ever come, if I'm still single at the time, but as I watched his Twitter interactions, I found myself growing jealous. Engaging in flirty conversations with other women, liking their suggestive pictures, it was driving me crazy. I finally confronted him about it and said, ""If you love me, why are you still liking other girls' pictures? Is it not enough to have your wife and speak to me that you then need to flirt with even more women? I get the feeling you're just after some quick sex and something physical, not this deep emotional connection you claim we have.""

And he wrote me back a very long message. In brief, it said, ""I do love you...more than you will ever know. But I can't leave my wife for you as it'll destroy my children. (I never outright asked him to!!! I do understand his reasoning!) And I want something you cannot give me. I miss the intimacy, the physical touch. Even though you're my dream woman, trying to control me and noticing me talking to other women is not fair and not something I want in a relationship. Ultimately you want a fully fledged relationship but I can't give that to you right now. I love you so much, and I'll always be here for you, but let's just be friends now.""
And reading that DESTROYED me! It was then that I realised how much I'd fallen for this person over the past few months. I got insanely jealous when he interacted with other women because I felt like it invalidated everything he was saying about how he felt towards me and I realise now that deep down I probably DID believe his words, despite my constant denials on the surface. I am so, so torn about what to do. He's married, so I know I need to stay away, but then I think...maybe what he's saying is true?  He and his wife really do lead separate lives? I immediately deleted my Twitter account after he sent me that message but I want to reactivate it and tell him I can't lose him and maybe even meet in person, finally. I thought it'd be a sigh of relief, because all I ever want is a simple, easy, loyal relationship, not to be some secret on the side, but I realise now how much I terribly miss him. I miss him so, so much. It is really hard. I did become attached to him. I don't know if my emotions are clouding my judgment and if I should stay away, but the idea of being alone and not having him in my life makes me feel dreadful. But I know I'm very young at only 20 to be making a decision like this that can have a lot of repercussions, so I'm writing to ask for advice from anyone please. I NEVER thought I would be in the position where I fell for a 'married' man. That alone makes me want to stay far away from him, but when feelings get involved everything ultimately ends up more complicated...

TL DR - I ended up falling for a guy who is still married, despite claiming he wants nothing to do with his wife and doesn't love her. He's told me he loves me, but I can't morally meet him or pursue a relationship while he's married to someone else. He told me that because of this he wants to stop things altogether but now I feel so confused as it's hard to let go of him.",relationship_advice
t3_dlegm5,My mental illness is ruining the best relationship of my life - desperate for tips and advice.,"TLDR: I have BPD and the symptoms I suffer make me paranoid that my boyfriend will leave me, that I‚Äôm not good enough for him, that I‚Äôm annoying and unattractive etc. I am getting help for this. How do I feel better in the mean time and need less reassurance? 


I (23f) have been with my boyfriend (23m) since the beginning of the year. It has been incredible, I‚Äôm feeling so loved and in love to an extent I never thought was possible. However, my BPD (borderline personality disorder) and my past is making me so anxious, paranoid, and emotionally explosive that I fear it will ruin and end this relationship.  I‚Äôm currently medicated and seeing a psychologist. I‚Äôve spoken to him about how I feel and he always reassures me, but I haven‚Äôt told him the full extent of my worries because I know they sound crazy. 

It is my first serious relationship as an adult, due to my mental health issues which have severely impacted past relationships. Now that I‚Äôm in something loving and stable, I am literally always worried that he will leave me. I feel this way for a number of reasons - my self esteem is incredibly low and I fear he will fall for someone else better looking, he might get sick of my overreactions and emotions and leave for someone else more stable, or both, and he just gets sick of me and wants to be single. 

As I write this, I know I‚Äôm paranoid. He has done nothing to cause me to feel this way. He mainly has male friends, he barely uses his phone or social media to talk to people, he‚Äôs so full of compliments about my appearance, he‚Äôs affectionate (in public and private) and so so caring - he does so many little things for me. I could go on and on. We have little fights here and there, and our only major one in 9 months was caused by me when I was drunk. He‚Äôs incredible, and I almost feel guilty for worrying these things will happen. 

But I‚Äôm just so scared he will get sick of me. I overreact a lot (I apologise and make up for it but probably too much), I occasionally have a day when I‚Äôm extremely anxious and need a lot of reassurance, I‚Äôm a bit overweight and average looking (it‚Äôs hard not to call myself fat and disgusting because that‚Äôs subjective lol), I‚Äôm incredibly insecure about other women (compare myself a lot), and I‚Äôm clingy, although I try to not show it. 



Basically what I‚Äôm asking for is advice on how to not feel this way, or experiences from anyone similar. It‚Äôs to the point where it‚Äôs stopping me from fully being able to enjoy the relationship because I‚Äôm so worried it will end. I‚Äôm so stuck being paranoid that I can‚Äôt even appreciate what is otherwise such a fun, loving, healthy relationship. What can I do? What would/did you do?",relationship_advice

t3_dlgea8,I (24M) feel extremely loved but undesired by my fiance (25F) who either doesn't see sex as big of a priority as me or is afraid to bring it up to me. How do I increase out intimacy again and without adding friction to our relationship?,"Hello everyone, the title pretty much speaks for itself in my opinion. Just to add a little bit more context though, my fiance and I have been together for four years this year and engaged for half of 2019. We're getting married next October and both of us are over the moon about it. We love each other deeply and I can't imagine my life without her. She's everything I want and honestly, everything thing I need in a romantic partner. I just feel better being around her and she simply makes me happy. Of course, we plan on having a family and talk about it all the time, but the one thing that is a new constant in our relationship, and I hate to call it a constant, is the fact that we've hardly had sex anymore.

Now, I don't mean to say we never have sex anymore, but we're lucky if it's once a month now, and honestly, I have a difficult time sometimes remembering when the last time was. Earlier on in our relationship (after about a year or so in cause we moved slowly) we had sex at least once a week or every other week when she would come to visit me, or I would go to visit her. Now, with us living together, maybe she's grown complacent, or comfortable, I don't know? Just as a side note, we DO live with her parents (thanks expensive housing market) we have our own room and complete privacy so in my opinion this really isn't an issue. She has mentioned in the past when I've brought it up that often times she's tired because of her job (full-time daycare) which having been there I completely get, but I teach full time and I'm always willing and ready to go. Call me a horndog, but I love her deeply and sex is one way I express that. 

As I implied earlier, I have brought this situation up to her a couple of times and granted I'll admit I haven't been the best about it due to a combination of me not being the most eloquent speaking/communicator with my own feelings/frustrations (something I've always struggled with and try to get better at) and it hasn't gone very well. She'll admit that she should try harder and that I ""have needs"", which is fine, but I don't want having sex to feel like it's just something for me or something she has to feel obligated doing. I just want it to feel natural, loving and fun. 

Just as a disclaimer, I would never cheat on her. Ever. I just want to be able to bring the physical love back to the forefront of our relationship, not feel so sexually frustrated and somewhat neglected, while making sure my fiance is happy and doesn't feel guilty if I were to bring this up to her. So, how do I bring the physical love back more frequently to our relationship?

t3_dlgdlm,My(24M) gf(23F) makes me feel like shit when she goes home for a couple of days,"First of all, i'm just going to speak my mind. I've been with this girl for a little over a year now and we have the most amazing time when we are together. She's at my place like 3-5 days a week(She lives at her parents). We have so much fun together, and when we are just hanging around watching some netflix or something she pretty much can't go 5 minutes without telling or showing me how much she loves me. And i'm sure she does. But that's not really the point. When we are together i love her so much. But when she's at her parents house for a few days she seems pretty distant. We do text each other quite often but she has the habit of telling me something upsetting the day when she goes back home(trough text). Like a comment on something i did wich she didn't like or telling me to take my study seriously or that i've been too clingy or something. I am a pretty clingy guy sometimes and it is something i don't like about myself but im working on it. She's clingy aswell though, so when im being clingy she tells me but when it's the other way around i don't really mind it. But i really hate when she does this just after she left because it makes me feel guilty and i start to question myself and our whole relationship. 
We then do text alot when she's at her parents but sometimes it seems not genuine when she tells me something like she loves me when we're texting. This turns around when we get on skype though, wich we do almost every day. When we talk trough skype i get happy again because she makes me feel loved again when we're just talking about how our days went.
Every night before we go to bed when we're apart we tell each other the standard ""i love you"" and some heart emoji's etc. wishing each other a good night and so forth. But sometimes it just doesn't feel like she means it, i'm sure she does because when we see each other again it's all good and she shows me she loves me. 
But yesterday, when we said each other goodnight, i love you etc. I said that i love her but when i said it i didn't feel anything. It made me lay in bed thinking about it for hours and i couldn't sleep because of it. 
I do love her but this made me question our whole relationship. I feel like a bitch complaining about it but i just have to tell it to someone and hoping i can get some advise on what to do with this. 
Sorry for the shit post i'm just not really thinking and just venting...

t3_dlecqa,How do I (19F) tell my best friend(18F) I dont want to move in with her anymore?,"Using a throwasay since she follows my main account. Also sorry for bad formatting and grammar I'm a bit high and on Mobile 

So since the end of the school year (may2019) my best friend and I have been making loose plans to move out and rent a place together and she found an apartment she loves and thinks we could afford. At  first I was all for it but now I'm not so sure I want to move out of my parents house especially since she's really pushing for us to move out but the end of the year when I personally don't think we'll be ready for financially.

This is something I've brought up but she always seems to have an argument ready and fights me on it or just makes a face of displeasure. Also we don't really have the same plans in life as I want to go to college next year and she doesn't I want to move out of state at some point soon after college to pursue my dreams and she wants to stay in state and close to her family. I want to buy a van and make it into one of those camper vans and travel. I want to be able to save up money as well. its not like we have bad situations at home that require us to move out it's just something she really wants to do and while I was all for it at first I have definitely changed my mind since then and at this point of I moved in with her i would most definitely be doing it for her and not for me.

I also want to note that I did confess I liked her very recently and she said that she couldn't see us together which is very valid and not what this is about at all and I was already having heavy doubts about moving before I told her.

I know she'll probably be very upset and mad especially since shes so excited to move but i just don't feel comfortable moving out when i have a good stable place to live already and where i dont have to pay anything but the water bill each month. I also definitely feel as it would hold me back from pursuing my own goals and I'm just not sure how to approach her about it.

Tldr: I was planning on moving out with my bff but I dont want to anymore since I want to be able to pursue my dreams without being held back by bills and I dont know how to tell her that I dont want to move anymore.",relationship_advice
t3_dlgae5,"My husband has trouble getting hard, but he gets frustrated if I don't continue to try to get him hard","The advice is usually to not make a big deal about it or focus on other things. Which I tried to do when this first started. But if he doesn't get hard and have an orgasm when we're getting intimate then he gets frustrated. 

I've already discussed what could be wrong and what can fix it at length in other posts. I'm doing what I can and what he does about it isn't in my control. 

So do I just need to continue putting a lot of effort into getting him hard every time? If so, I probably won't be able to have sex with him more than once a week. 

Or, if I sometimes stop trying and let him be frustrated I could probably stick to a few times a week. But that feels selfish when he definitely wants an orgasm.",relationship_advice

t3_dlg7xy,What should I do? HELP,"Here's a bit of backstory. My girlfriend of 6 years just broke up with me two nights ago. Over the past week, I decided to go hang out with my friends at this pub in Denver. I am (23) and go to university with a Business degree and definitely have a lot of my life sorted out. my girlfriend also goes to the same university and we are the same age. My girlfriend is very anti-drugs/alcohol. She doesn't like anything about it and wants me to have no part in it. I have tried to talk to her about it but she won't budge whatsoever. At the pub, my friend had a blunt, and I decided to smoke for the first time ever. She saw the blunt on our friend's story and asked him about it and he told her what had happened. However, when she asked me, I lied. A couple of nights ago, I admitted it while we were in bed and she was extremely upset with me and told me that I need to go (I was sleeping over at her apartment), I left but I tried to talk to her before I left and she didn't talk to me at all, so I proceeded to leave. The next day we didn't talk but this morning we have had some small talk. She is absolutely disgusted in me and stated that we will never get back together and that she hates me. . I have tried to talk to her, but she hasn't really talked to me since. I am completely devastated and I deeply regret what I did. I know lying wasn't my best option but I didn't want her to know. She doesn't trust me at all now and is questioning what else I've lied to her about (nothing) as I truly tell her everything. She also told me that I need to choose between her or the friends I went to the pub with. How do I get her to forgive me and trust me again? How do I get her to get back with me? What should I do? She wants to block all of the friends that I went with and wants all my passwords and wants me to lose contact with all of my friends that were in this. She also said im on a ""trial period"" where shell see if she wants me or not and i guess i have to be on my best behavior... Should I leave?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: I have talked to her about doing weed at frats and stuff where I usually find weed here in Denver but she doesn't want me to use it all. She also said regardless if I lied about it or not, the outcome would have been the same.",relationship_advice
t3_dle9j9,I [29M] have a child with a [35F] woman I don't love. I feel stuck in the mud and depressed.,"Look, I've made some shit decisions. I persisted in a relationship with a woman I don't love out of fear of being alone. I was about to end the relationship but then my partner became pregnant. I now have a 9-month old child and I'm 29. I love her but being a parent while being stuck in an unhappy relationship is making my mindset and my thoughts incredibly toxic. I just feel more depressed because of my poor choices and lack of control.

I know I am not the first person to ever have a child with the wrong person, and many such people have gone on to live ok lives while playing an important role in their child's upbringing. But I know I won't ever live an ok life, not least because I am desperately unhappy and I see no way out of this. 

I don't even have friends I can lean on for support. I have come to realize my friends are really just drinking buddies. Not one of them has gone out of their way to see my baby, even just once. I don't care if they like kids or not, it would be nice if they at least saw this important person who has been in my life for 9 months just once, even if it's ten minutes.

I have always been depressed and having a kid when I'm in such a negative mental health space is wrong on every level but I am trying my best to be there for my child. I can't end the relationship because my partner is from another country, 12 hours by plane from where I grew up. So now I am stuck in this foreign country feeling unhappy and obliged to stay in a relationship that is not working. 

It's all well and good to say I've made terrible decisions and selfish decisions but that doesn't provide a path to sorting out this mess in a way that is conducive to the maximum happiness for all parties. I don't know if any therapist has dealt with as complex and messed up a situation, and I am kind of poor right now so i felt Reddit might be a good place to look for advice.",relationship_advice
t3_dlg7r1,Would it be okay to suggest a planned hangout be a date?,"I've [25M] worked with a girl [23F] for about five years, but we rarely talked until some six months ago, I will call her Sin√©ad O'Connor. We work in different departments, but another coworker who I am friends with, Enya, started conversations between Sin√©ad and me, knowing our common interests. As in I'd go talk to Enya, then she'd essentially pass me over to Sin√©ad O'Connor. She had no intent on it being a ""you and Sin√©ad O'Connor should date"" thing, I was in a long term relationship at the time, albeit an abusive one. 


I eventually started wandering over to talk to her, started messaging her on the facebook messenger to ask her questions about school, Sin√©ad O'Connor is studying the same thing as I am, but is much further along. The questions sometimes dovetailed into conversations. After Sin√©ad helped me with some complex school stuff I told her ""by the way if you ever want to hang out or something, hit me up"" to which she said, ""yes!"" 


I never used the word date, so I dont think it was a date, when we were saying bye Sin√©ad said it was a lot of fun and she was glad we did it, when I got home I suggested we should do it again sometime. Sin√©ad O'Connor is supposed to hit me up about when she might be free and from there we will make plans. Would it be appropriate to suggest it be a date whilst we are making the plans?


For what it's worth, I'm apparently not as subtle as I thought I was with my crush on Sin√©ad O'Connor. Other coworkers have made comments and asked if I was into her.",relationship_advice
t3_dle99l,My[F24] boyfriend[30] is very openminded about ‚Äòtroubled‚Äô people - maybe too much?,"Okay so that‚Äôs a very controversial title, I know. I have to start with a bit of background though.
What I am referring to is my brother. When I was little he sexually abused me for several years and mentally and emotionally manipulated me to the cruelest extend. I think I suffered somewhat of ‚Äúa kind of‚Äù Stockholm Syndrom bc nevertheless I had looked up to him and worshipped him. He never had my back though and made fun of me in front of my friends. To the outside, he‚Äôs an absolute angel but in the family a complete and utter monster. He even used to try to beat up my mom and dad. He‚Äôs gotta be sick in the head, at the very least a high functioning sociopath. He has manipulated my friends countless times and they turned against me. Sure, they weren‚Äôt good friends apparently but naturally, over the years, I got somewhat paranoid that he‚Äôd get between me and my friends/boyfriend all my life. 
So I started telling my friends how awful he was. Warning them. Warning my current boyfriend as well and telling him what he did to me. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, my boyfriend is a sweetheart, but he has had a troubled past and is very tolerant when it comes to others, knowing or rather believing that people cope differently with issues and that they might lash out at others and stuff.. so he doesn‚Äôt judge lightly..and that‚Äôs exactly what scares me. He believes me but wants to paint his own picture which I totally get bc I am the same. Usually. But he even ‚Äújoked‚Äù that maybe I was just making it all up about my brother. I know my brother and he is such a good actor and I am scared af that my boyfriend is gonna find him not so bad. Granted, it would only do me a favor, knowing I can‚Äôt trust him bc he‚Äôs been blinded my brother‚Äôs fake charms. One more person to check off the list. But I like him and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I just let things play out and see what kinda impression my brother makes on him? I feel like pushing wouldn‚Äôt help. But I can‚Äôt help but have that fucking bad feeling about it all. And my gut never is wrong and I hate it.

t3_dlg72e,What advice do you have about me(M/25) and my ex girlfriend(F/24)?,"My girlfriend and I broke up a year ago after a 6 month relationship. We haven't talked for about 5 months and we just started talking again last April. Before April, we had no contact because we tried to make it work again after the break up but we ended up going nowhere as I wanted to get back with her but she didn't want to at that time.

The reason we broke up is because of some differences that at the time we couldn't resolve. I was somewhat needy and I didn't like the way she carried herself when she would go drink at bars with her friends. She told me that she didn't want to be in a relationship with me at that point anymore because she felt I could be doing more in life. I thought I was though. I was a student while at the same time working a part time job at night. Yes, I still live with my parents but it is only because I want to focus on school and some small bills. This made us fight a lot and it lead to a 5 month hiatus between us.

Since April, we have contacted each other again and we have tried to work things out. It wasn't easy but I was focused on finding out if we still had love for each other the way it once was. I had always hoped that she would bring the conversation back and I was excited but at the same time scared that it might not lead to anything. We told each other how sorry we were for breaking each other's hearts. I said that I didn't handle my emothins well and she said she was sorry for saying that I wasn't doing much with my life.

A few months pass and we take some time to get to a point where we might see where things are going. But eventually I learned some things that alerted me. She had told me how during the time when we weren't speaking to each other she's seen other guys but not for dates but rather as fwb. I was kind of let down knowing that she had already moved on fast. She assured me that it was just sex and nothing more. It didn't bother me so much until I saw what was on her phone.

Last August I went to Germany for a month for a wedding. She did tell me that she was talking to her ex but that it was nothing serious. When I got back from Germany my curiosity grew. One day she left her phone unlocked and I saw the messages. It had ""I miss you"" and ""I've been thinking about you too"" from him and her both but I didn't bring it up to her attention. I trusted her enough that it wasn't what it seemed. Or maybe at this point I'm just being dumb to realize.

In September she graduated from school and wanted me to attend her graduation. At this time, I didn't know what was happening between us and during the same week, my dad was diagnosed with cancer and my cat of 15 years had just passed. I told her that I didn't think I was mentally ok to attend as so much was happening in my life. That and the fact that I was starting to doubt if she was just having me around just because. She got angry and threw a fit. I was hurting and it wasn't looking good from my side. But I tried to reason with her about how my life at that point was at a low and I told her I was sorry for missing her graduation but I needed time to recover. She said she understood and we tried to move on from it.

A couple of weeks later, I get a call from her saying that she doesn't want to try to pursue a relationship anymore or try to work things out like we had been. At that point I let it go because I was tired. Tired of asking her if being a good person with good character was enough for her. She said that I was a good person but that she felt tired of having to tell me to do certain things. I said like what and she told me that it didn't matter and told me she was sorry.

Two weeks ago I get a call from her saying that she misses me and asked for me to have lunch with her. We talked for about an hour and told her that I was willing to try to make things work one last time and that if she was going to try to pursue a relationship with me again that whatever business she had with ex's from her past had to end completely. She said she understood. It felt all was well again and that things were starting to look good for us again.

Then 2 days ago she called me up saying she had something to tell me. She was hanging out with some friends and they invited some friends. They were drinking and they went to her house. Her friend and boyfriend ended up having sex in the guest room and she ended up going down on the guy's friend. Honestly at this point as I am writing this, I am so numb that I don't know what to think anymore. I feel like my love for her is watered down and that I have nothing more to hold on to and that deep down I already know what to do. But we talked about it. She said that it was just purely sex and nothing more. She basically wanted to tell me that she would understand if I would never talk to her again. My only option was that I could tell her goodbye forever or that she got it all out of her system and try to figure out she wants to do with me moving forward.

I feel like I know that this is f\*\*\*\*\* up but at the same time I'm not surprised anymore because of my gut feeling about how she might really think of me. But at the same time I feel like my mental health is too far down the drain to really know it.",relationship_advice
t3_dlg5t8,Unsure about my relationship.,"Hi,

Never posted anything on reddit really so bear with me. I [23M] am unsure about how I feel towards my [22F] gf and our relationship.

We have been together for a little over 2 years and we have gradually started arguing more. Inte the beginning it was heated and both of us getting furious and she screamed at me one or two times. I never yelled at her and I was really surprised when she yelled at me the first time. 

We don't always fight about everything, but we fight often and about anything. We can even agree on the same thing and then argue over it anyways. 

I have never had this kind of relationship with anyone else. I feel like I have to try my very hardest not to fight and I don't feel like she does the same. I have stopped arguing loudly and mostly just keeping a straight face and giving simple answers to end the argument. She however almost always cries and yells at me if she doesn't leave into another room or for a walk first 

In our relationship I feel like she refuses to carry her weight in regards to our apartment. She never does the dishes apart from starting a machine or two. And never cleans otherwise either. Her clothes pile on the floor until i pick them up. If I say something about it she always gets mad. Same with the dishes.

Whenever I try to talk to her about how I feel she says I am complaining on her and that she is a worthless person, but she never change. She has always lived in a messy room/apartment. It is like she doesn't care and that it doesn't bother her. I have been gone for 4-5 days and the food which we had vefore I left still stood on the dining table.

She claims she has no time since Uni takes all her time. But when I get home from work I almost always catch her infront of the TV. I can understand that I she wants to relax, but that is not first priority. Especially not if you live with someone else that has to do the cleaining when you don't. Sometimes when I get home from work I can spen 2 hours just making the kitchen area spotless since I can't stand having a greasy stove and old food standing around (we've had fly problems). I dont ask her to do this I would just want her to not leave her things on the dining room table or infront of the TV or not make clothing piles on the floor which I have to wade through.

Don't get me wrong she is a wonderful loving perso  20-30% of the time. Other times she seem to not think about anyone than herself in that moment. I am afraid to talk aboit this with my friends or family since I don't want them to think anything bad about her. I am not how much more of this I want to deal with though :/

She can be altruistic, but in the way a child can. Breakfast in bed, sharing the last cookie small things like that. At the same time this behaviour bleeds in to other things such as her saying to my face the food I made that day is ""entirely ok, or not her favourite"". When we have agreed upon it and I already made it.

I don't know how to summarize this into a TLDR. Sorry for the wall of text. I just wanted to get it out of my system somehow.

Edit: I realise that this might be hard to comment on since this isn't everything that happened in our relationship. I also realise that I could be a massive shithead, but she never complains on things I do apart from the fact that I like sleeping in on the weekends and that I complain a lot about. By which she means when I express my concerns about her not cleaning or caring about our apartment.",relationship_advice
t3_dlg57v,How can I (26m) talk to my (27f) girlfriend ?,"I'm getting really fed up of her acting the way she does but every time I bring it up. She starts to deflect and say that it's me that does this.

Last night somebody crashed into the back of my car and rather than find out if Im okay. She's more worried that I'm going to start a friendship with the woman who crashed in to me. 

I took the ladies details and said that it would be better to look at the damage to my car during daylight. Which she agreed to. 

My girlfriend is making comments like I don't need to take her details if we aren't dealing with it through the insurance. 
Why cant I take our 21month old baby with me. 
Why can't I meet her here instead of there.

She treats me like I'm having an affair and talks to me like dirt. Presumably because I've spoken with another woman .

He came over to my house one day and he mentioned something about this girl and how i liked her to my mom while i was in the room and she kinda teased me a bit. Saying things like: ooooo OP has a crruuusshhh. Stuff like that. (Being kinda childish if you ask me.) And it made me feel really uncomfortable so then i kinda lost intrest in this girl. Being afraid that she's going to do that again. 

     Fast forward to grade 7. I had another crush on a girl  who i didn't really know as well as the previous girl but i still talked to her from time to time. I had just finished a band concert and my parents were in the music room to pick me up. The girl asked me a question about something in front of my parents and i blushed a lot. (No idea why.)

t3_dle5ha,(19M) I can‚Äôt seem to get interested in others and I struggle to make connections,"I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. Throughout primary school, I never really was that into girls. Although many of my peers dated and found girls attractive and my parents kept urging me to date, I simply found no interest in females. I did occasionally, for one or two girls, but I still overall didn‚Äôt find girls attractive. Then this year I met a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù online. Turns out this ‚Äúgirl‚Äù was actually a guy, but the thing was that I didn‚Äôt mind it. I started to realize I could have feelings for people regardless of sex, maybe even feelings primarily for the same sex. I met a guy online as well. He was interested in me and I was interested in him. He became very close, called each other pet names, talked to each other all the time over the phone. We even met up in person. During college orientation week, I took some time off for myself, so I asked him if he wanted to come visit me. He said yes, and I waited eagerly for him at the City Hall downtown. When he finally came, I felt so in love with him. We walked all over downtown, chatting, getting some food. I wanted to hold his hand, I wanted to kiss him, but I never got to, because I was nervous about being spotted. The fear became real when I spotted my parents walking along the same street, so I bolted. He said he saw real fear in my eyes. After that he grew cold towards me... and I became too needy and insecure... so he drifted away. Ever since I haven‚Äôt really felt anything for anyone. I‚Äôm now in college. I‚Äôm not attracted to anyone. I‚Äôm trying to make friends but I feel like I can‚Äôt make meaningful connections. I desire for love, or just simple companionship, yet I cannot even begin to find it.

t3_dle2go,I need help with my relationship,"Hi. This is my first post ever, so please bear with me. I've (22, F) been in an LDR with my boyfriend (26, M) for about 2.5 years now. He has been very good to me, spoils me with gifts, is hardworking, and has an incredibly nice family. We have met once earlier this year, and he is coming for my graduation (he bought the ticket as a surprise for me). I used to think I was the luckiest person in the world. But lately I've been feeling like we really aren't that compatible. Our personalities are very different, our signs are actually incompatible (I'm Taurus, he is Gemini- but in our case there is a lot of truth to it), we go at different paces, our communication has been getting worse. I generally don't even feel like talking to him anymore, or even video calling. This is also due to the fact that our conversations barely scratch the surface and we have never had one argument before, which is abnormal. He's beginning to feel more like a best friend instead of a boyfriend, and I'm pretty sure he has no clue how I feel. We both seem to struggle with avoiding hard topics. But when I try to open up about my insecurities and worries, he usually brushes it off, telling me I'll ""feel better in no time"", etc., and change the subject. Sometimes it gets frustrating and I end up bottling it all inside. I do not feel attracted to him anymore, either. And when he came to visit me, he would spend a lot of time on his phone rather than talk with me, go off on his own, and walk ahead of me all the time (he is a very fast walker). I had to speed-walk because he would not slow down for me. Also, when my sister joined us for lunch (their first time meeting too), he was walking ahead as usual and did not hold the door open for us, which bothered me. I was just hoping he would for my sister, because I appreciate that kind of thing and believe it's the respectable thing to do. Pretty sure my sister feels this way too. I was a little embarrassed after that. Every conversation has become so monotonous and pointless to me, chatting about our day, and I don't know how much more I can take. I do know I love him, but I'm not so sure if I'm in love with him anymore. Also, I was 19 when I first met him. I was very young and naive, and this is my first relationship. He seems to be taking this relationship much more seriously than I am and even says he'll do anything to make sure we live together. In fact, he wants me to move to where he is after I graduate (which I personally think is asking a lot from me) since I do not have a job or the money to afford it. I'm a full time college student. And our families have been supporting us to pursue this relationship, and deep down I know it does not matter what they think, but I can't help but feel pressured to stay in this. I just don't know what to do or how to feel. He tells me I'm the love of his life, and I just can't help but feel like there's something off. I can't even act on this right now because he's coming to visit again in Dec.. it's driving me crazy. Please share your thoughts with me. Thanks.",relationship_advice
t3_dlcpo8,I feel like a loser,"I had a perfect opportunity of landing the girl of my dreams. Already struck out twice with 2 other girls and there was this girl who had every good possible trait of a girlfriend. We had one good day where we snap chatted each other the whole day.

I asked her out to lunch over Snapchat while I barely knew her well and she found the situation very awkward. I even found out that she did not want to talk to me.

t3_dl79cw,Husband overprotective of Mom,"A little background, I am currently 9 months pregnant. My husband‚Äôs mom is not a monster, just overbearing and mildly insane. She is upset when we don‚Äôt get together every week or every other day really. She has no social media etiquette and is not at the age where she should just be allowed to be that way. But most importantly she does not respect any boundaries laid out plainly for her. 

For some examples, she told her whole family about my pregnancy before we were ready to announce it. She started planning my baby shower that was for this month in March, again before we were even ready to announce it, just so she could have control over my mom and step mom. She had a grandma shower thrown in her honor on the day of my shower, and put an early ending time iron the invites she made for it so she could get to her shower....then proceeded to send me braggy photos of every thing she got at this shower. 

Every time I try to talk to my husband about this he gets insanely defensive and just says that‚Äôs how she is and doesn‚Äôt want to change her. It‚Äôs not that I need her to change, I just need him to set boundaries with me so she can actually stick to them. When it‚Äôs just me saying things of what I want I‚Äôm led with 1000 ‚Äúyeah but..‚Äù from her and it‚Äôs exhausting, not to mention I am always made out to be an asshole afterwards. I am tired of the fighting between us, I‚Äôm tired of feeling like the jerk, I‚Äôm tired of feeling so alone and helpless when it comes to issues with his mom.",relationship_advice
t3_dldzfz,"People keep thinking that I'm(25M) gay, I'm not.","Over the past year I've had multiple people tell me that they thought that I was gay. I don't think I come across as gay, I typically wear ""nicer"" clothing(leather boots/button up shirts) because I find it comfortable. Most of my friends that I hang out with are women with boyfriends, my friends know I'm straight and introduce me to girls all the time, their boyfriends think I'm gay/bi though. A few weeks ago I went to a bar alone, which I like doing a lot, and two older(like 30s-40's) women started buying me drinks and being flirty, I was being flirty back, they started questioning me if I was gay because I wasn't grabbing them.  
I don't really care if I come across as gay, I know I'm not, but is there something about my description that screams gay about me? I'm thinking maybe it's because I act pretty aloof with women instead of pursuing them strongly.",relationship_advice
t3_dlfy47,Accept or reject?,"Husband got mad at me. My bestfriend and her sisters came to my place as one of her sister have a convocation near my place.

Oh, he worked on that day and return home around 7.00 p.m. 

I don't mind if he got mad. What I hate is he did not say that straight to me. He post a WhatsApp status to curse me. He did that before quite many times and we had an agreement to not do that again but he still did it. I hate him for his bad mouth. I totally cannot accept him this time.

t3_dkr6ms,I (20F) love being married to my husband (28M) but I didn‚Äôt sign up to marry my in-laws too. Please help.,"I met my husband almost 3 years ago as I‚Äôm turning 21 this month, and we been together ever since. We married in August, so 2 months ago. We are both from the Islamic faith-however my parents are young, liberal, and non-practicing as to where his parents are from Pakistan and old enough to be my grandparents, so old school. Upon marrying him- I knew I‚Äôd have to put on a little bit of a conservative/pious front, but I didn‚Äôt care because I loved him. Since there is ‚Äúno dating‚Äù in Islam, we didn‚Äôt meet each others parents until May of this year, when we were engaged. I would like to state, his family is very kind and polite (or to my face at least)..

Fast forward to now, we should be in our honeymoon phase and I am so miserable. I feel like my youth and psyche have been sucked out of me. I feel guilty too because these people are nice- but in so many words short, they‚Äôve hi-jacked my relationship. He has proven himself to be such a mommas boy, I am so freaking turned off and shocked. I believe he‚Äôd honestly love if we slept in his house in the bed he grew up sleeping on at this point. They call **everyday** multiple times a day. I‚Äôm (we) expected to drop everything I‚Äôm doing to drive to my in-laws and sit there. The worst part?

I‚Äôm working for dads law firm and he‚Äôs working for his dads business... coincidently enough)** so, there is NO reason for that, besides for them to control me- watch me like a hawk, and most likely criticize me somehow. 

And how do I know all of this? Since we been married I don‚Äôt think my husband has said ONCE to them, ‚ÄúNo, Mom (or whoever else) I‚Äôm just going to be with my wife today alone‚Äù he **LIES** he‚Äôs working instead and makes excuses up.

t3_dlfvt7,How do I help my partner feel heard? Is there any hope for us? Super long,"He (m32) doesn't feel I (f31) listen to him.

This morning he was already in a bad mood from something our cat did - he has depression &amp; things easily seem hopeless/irritating to him.

But he hadn't taken it out on me - until his pants for work were an issue.

To cut it short, he usually wears the same pants two days in a row - this makes laundry predictable.

Today he asked if he has clean pants because his are in the wash - I say no, he walks away saying something like ""fucking perfect"" - I didn't feel personally attacked, I understood he was having a stressful morning &amp; that it wasn't my fault he broke schedule.

But when he came back I offered to have his pants clean daily, as it's the summer - he said no, it's his fault they were in the wash, not a normal thing.
I still offered again, but also acknowledged I understood it wasn't what caused the issue today - just wanted to re-offer as it is summer &amp; he might not have felt he could ask me to do more than I do basically.

But he snapped, he started to go off about how I don't listen &amp; used a tone I can only describe as the angsty, defensive, child, repeating what I said in just a childish mocking tone.

Then he went away for a few minutes to finish getting ready, when he came back - I asked him if he would like to apologize, he went off again stating that he doesn't feel heard, so he thinks his response is just - then he walked out stating he hates this place.

In my mind he was pissed off at himself for his uniform issue &amp; has no ability to focus on what's really annoying him, so he acts immature.

Now, I text him the below:



I asked you if you were happy with the way you spoke to me, because I didn't expect you to feel justified in being so snappy &amp; rude when I thought I was offering something nice, even if it wasn't directly related to today's issue, I still heard you &amp; was just trying to make sure that whatever happened today wouldn't be an issue in the future.

I thought giving you a chance to apologize before work would get it off your shoulders (and mine) for the day, so there wouldn't be an anxiety building day, that's why I persisted - because otherwise,the chances of an apology are slim &amp; it's likely to just build until a fight happens, because I'm sorry if you feel differently-but I'll never accept being spoken down to like that.

You walking out, saying you hate this place just feels so unfair on-top of that - I can't unhear that &amp; it's over something so small (I'm not trying to minimise how you feel, I'm sure your feelings are huge) but the actual act of offering to have pants available daily, even after acknowledging I understood that wasn't your problem today - and then getting demeaned as a partner being TOLD I'm not listening in such a rude way is really awful.

I was listening - you were just picking up on the fact that I still persisted with the offer as not hearing you at all - but it wasn't that, I just never wanted you to feel like you couldn't ask for fresh pants daily, for all I knew you had a bad guts - but saying fresh pants for the summer is better that saying, fresh pants incase of the runs.

I still understand that you were in an unhappy mood this morning, due to Jimmy, but I'm not looking to get knocked down whenever something else is pissing you off &amp; I hope that you don't expect me to.


I would appreciate you having a think &amp; if you're still ok with the way you dealt with things, just be honest &amp; say you stand by your actions. If you wish it had gone differently, talk to me - I'm still here to help you in anyway I can.

Feeling unheard, even when I say I hear you &amp; repeat what you've said is something that can be worked on, it is likely you were just on edge &amp; we need to help you recognise those signs so you can pull back.

Let me know when you've had a think &amp; know that I'm really trying to be hear for you

**

He replied 

I don't think I said anything or used a tone that was unreasonable for someone who was getting increasingly frustrated and angry.

**

To which I replied

**

I think we're at an impasse, I will never be able to accept that when you're frustrated/angry it's acceptable to be demeaning &amp; rude, especially when hardly any of your frustrations came from our conversation - you were stressed before I even opened my mouth, but I wore the brunt of that frustration.

I understand you don't feel heard.
But, that's not the same as not being heard.
I heard you, I understood you &amp; you stating that it doesn't seem like I'm hearing you, doesn't take away from the fact that I do - you not feeling heard, is a problem you have to acknowledge to be able to work on it.

To me, if it's ok for you to treat me this way just because you're having a rough time, then by that logic, it's ok for me to act out when my hormones are raging &amp; we both know it's not, because you don't deserve to be my emotional punching bag when with a bit of effort, I can control myself - or remove myself in some instances.

I have room for patience when dealing with your frustrations, because I understand that sometimes our initial reactions/behaviours can be hard to control - but the behaviour after the fact is important, you feeling justified in being so demeaning is not something I can accept.

If I stand for that abuse, I will never be happy or whole, I will always think you must think so little of me to find it ok &amp; not having respect is an unacceptable quality in a life partner.

So I implore you to think more on whether you find it ok, because I don't think you really do, you've never found it acceptable to let your frustrations out on me, so if something has really changed in you &amp; you find even small levels of abuse tolerable, I need to know &amp; I need to think.

Now, I have absolutely no fight in me, my body is a mess &amp; I just can't take it.
I'm going to be in the spare room tonight, unless you desire to talk things through - but I won't initiate the discussion, I only want to talk when you won't get angry, dinner will be cooked &amp; keeping warm for you.


----

I'm really trying to help you, you might think I don't care about your side of things, but I do - I've been emotionally abusive towards you in the past when my hormones were not in control &amp; I recognise you might be dealing with the same lack of control due to health issues. (Which I also know you are working on)
I'm trying to give you a way out &amp; offer support rather than abandonment just because you're having a tough time or ignoring it &amp; letting it fester.

Nothing I wrote is without love

***End texts

And then he came home, ate &amp; has gone to bed, so no fight, but no resolution either &amp; we didn't speak at all.

So whilst this post is very long, my questions are short.

How do I help him feel heard when it's ingrained in him that I'm not listening? He is often so upset because he feels unheard, even if I repeat back what he saying, it's like he just doesn't feel I'm getting the point.

Or if I bring up something in addition to what he's talking about, he thinks I haven't heard the rest. 

Like his pants, he was mad I repeated the offer to have pants daily because he couldn't hear that I heard &amp; acknowledged today's problem, but hey, whilst were on the topic...do you need this too?

I'm starting to just feel belittled as a partner, I can't handle being told I don't listen, I do my best to be available for communication &amp; have tried all the ways I can think to make him feel heard.

Am I doing the right thing in my texts?

 Am I a kind communicator?

 Am I awful?

t3_dlck9b,"3 years without my best friend, I need advice","I met her in middle school. She was quiet and didn‚Äôt have many friends. Then everything changed, and I spent most of my days with her. Our families would hang out together, her and I would take trips together, go on picnics, to museums, exploring adventures (well into our teens), party together, throw parties together, spend christmas‚Äô together - at one point my family was homeless and we lived with her family for about six months. My parents divorced and when I was 17 I had to move. 

She befriended this other girl, and we would all hang out together even though i never felt very close to the new one. As my moving date got closer, there was more friction in our friendship. I found her annoying, as much as i hate to admit it. It was like her and the new girl took every side they possibly could against me, it didn‚Äôt matter what we were talking about. Most the time it didn‚Äôt even make sense, it just seemed like they wanted to argue. The second I left town, her and her new friend bombarded me with texts saying that they always felt like I was manipulating her (*them* since this new girl was now in the picture), and in the middle of our discussion, she just stopped responding. And then nothing after that.

About a year later, I texted her and tried to reconcile. I admitted that I had toxic traits (living in an abusive home didn‚Äôt help) and I owned up to my part in the problem. Looking back on all the ‚Äúarguments‚Äù, if they felt i was manipulative, it would make sense that they just wanted to have a voice in anything. The text didn‚Äôt really change anything though, we never started talking again. 

I feel that now, things could never be the same. But I miss what we had. Friend break ups hurt SO much more than relationship ones. I still live many states away, so it‚Äôs not like going to coffee to talk about it all is an option. 

I am at a loss, and I feel that i‚Äôve lost something irreplaceable, but considering that over that year before I sent the text, that she never reached out, maybe the whole thing meant more to me than her. At this point it‚Äôs been 3 years, and nothing.",relationship_advice

t3_dl09fd,26/f married to 25/m- considering divorce. Need advice,"I am not sure what to do at this point in our marriage. We have been married 4 years, together 6. We have no children. 

My husband is a good guy, he treats me well. But he has no work ethic, he did not have a job for over 2 years and his family helped support us. Now that they stopped he has had 3 Jobs over the course of one year. 

He flat out lied to my face everyday for an entire month saying he was working and come paycheck time I saw he made $150 for two weeks. I asked him about it, he lied saying things got messed up at work. 

The next paycheck was the same. I found out instead of working 30 hours a week he was only working 15. 

We both work from home, so every time I went into his office he pretended to work. And his excuse why he didn't tell me was because he didn't want to hear me lecture him about how he needs to work... 

So instead he lied to me for a month. Probably more, because I don't do the finances so I usually don't look at our bank accounts. 

I have worked the same job for the past 4 years, I hate it. The company is garbage, but I stuck with it. Why because we need money, we are married adults. I don't have a rich family to call to pay my bills like he does. I also have a side business/hustle where I make and sell things online. Its physical work that I do on top of my 40 hours a week. That brings in good side money, but not enough to do full time ya know. 

But on top of those two jobs, I also have to do all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the shopping, and taking care of our animals. 

After 6 years of doing all this I am fed up. Now we have had this ""laziness"" argument for 6 years. Nothing has changed, and I am at my breaking point. I am tired of doing everything while he doesn't even work full time, and all his free time is spent playing video games. 

I know this may sound petty to others who have experienced worse in a relationship, but just because a guy is nice does that mean I should just put up with everything else? I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thank you.",relationship_advice

t3_dl9ksr,Nannying my bratty cousins while their parents are in the midst of a Divorce. I need help!!!,"Hello, a little back story. I am a college student, I recently transferred to a college which happens to be relatively close to where my dads side of the family lives (roughly about 20 hours away from where I grew up with my family). My immediate family and I tended to keep our distance from my dads side just because it was a tad dysfunctional. They‚Äôre great people don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs just different values sets and less stable marriages.  I was extremely lucky to have grown up with my parents being totally compatible for each other and I seriously believe my parents are souls mates. Anyways, since I had moved closer to my dads side of the family for school, I had decided I would make a conscious effort to get to know my cousins more. My cousins on my moms side and I were very close and I felt almost guilty for barely knowing my cousins on my dads side. So I knew I wanted to try and make that relationship happen here. The issue is, the cousins on my dad side are younger and extremely difficult to be around. They are extremely entitled and crazy spoiled to where they literally hit and kick my aunt with no repercussions. It‚Äôs a nightmare to be around. But the kids behavior is nothing compared to my uncles behavior towards my aunt. He was diagnosed MS and as a result became an alcoholic and verbally abusive to my aunt. As a result of his MS he is unable to work since he confided to a wheelchair. Overall it‚Äôs a toxic situation. 

(My Current Situation) My Aunt had asked if I could help watch my cousins (12 y/o girl and 9 y/o boy) on certain days I don‚Äôt have school. I agreed. My thought process was that I could maybe be a positive influence in their lives. I thought maybe I could help them with their difficult home life. Oh boy was I wrong, it‚Äôs hard to tell what is just the child‚Äôs personality or if it‚Äôs a result of the tension in their household but everytime I tried to help them/discipline them so they become better children it was horrible. And by disciple, I mean simple stuff like if you‚Äôre going to make a craft makes sure to tidy up afterwards, or simply being able to make a sandwich for themselves. This was not what I expected. I had expected I would watch and hang out with my cousins, not a nannying job deserving of the super nanny. But I had already made my commitment to help out for the year. And I especially couldn‚Äôt back out Bc a few weeks in, my aunt let me know that she would be divorcing their kids father soon. So she thanked me for helping them through this hard time and it meant a lot. So I am screwed. 

I really need advice on how to set healthy boundaries with my cousins, how to talk to them about the divorce (if they prompt it), and generally how to navigate this whole thing. Like I said earlier I have no experience with divorce or fighting parents. I don‚Äôt know what divorces parents feels like and I just really want to be able to help my cousins. If any of you went through a divorce like this as a kid, please let me know if there is anything I can do to help them? Bc I have a hunch their behavior is due to their toxic home and a lack of structure. I really do just want to help, Bc I know brutal divorces can really mess up a kid.",relationship_advice
t3_dlb9r8,Friend‚Äôs sister sent me nudes,"Sorry for the long post. For context:
Around 10 years ago (I was 18), I used to tutor a few of my friends siblings (and their friends). This friend‚Äôs sister, let‚Äôs call her Anna, was someone everyone in our friend group liked (not sexually, more like a friend sort of way). She was 16 and giving her A levels (or class 12 as some countries call it) then.
We used to gel well, and on her 18th birthday we all got together and drank and shit. She met my wife (then just a friend) that day and they got along well too. Anna got way too drunk and confessed that she had a thing for me. We just ended up laughing it off, after all she‚Äôs not only my friends sister but also my student - so I never even thought of her that way.

Fast forward 10 years: I got married, we moved to Australia, wife pregnant with kid. We didn‚Äôt keep in touch with our old friends for about 5-6 years? So Anna (friends sister) knocks me and we chat and catch up. It‚Äôs nice to have someone you know in a different country, and she‚Äôs practically our neighbour now.
Anna usually parties - hard. We never cared since it never affected us. She keeps asking me to go drinking with her but I keep telling her that since my wife can‚Äôt drink, I won‚Äôt either.

Fast forward yesterday: She knocks me and it‚Äôs apparent that she‚Äôs pretty messed up. She sends me a pic of her pulling her shirt up and saying ‚ÄúI want your face here‚Äù. I tell her that she‚Äôs drunk and she should stop before she gets in trouble. She sends another one saying ‚ÄúIf these get out or your wife sees then you‚Äôre in more trouble than me lol‚Äù.
Wife did see. I showed it to her. Wife is livid. I want to move past this, but wife is pretty furious. I texted Anna today hoping she understood that what she did was wrong and that we can all get together and move past it.
No, she says she‚Äôs just pissed I showed it to my wife. That she wanted a discreet relationship.

I like this girl as a friend, and it is impossible to explain how good it feels to have someone from your home country - that too someone you‚Äôre friends with - near you. What do I do? Do I just let go or try to sit and talk? I‚Äôm not up for two timing - don‚Äôt have the time, patience, or mental fortitude for it.

A bit of extra info: Anna‚Äôs brother and me haven‚Äôt talked to each other, but her mom sometimes knocks me when she wants us to help Anna with a bit of money and shit (the mom pays us back). So it‚Äôll be awkward telling her mom that I can‚Äôt help her coz she sent me pics of her tits.

t3_dl79vt,My girlfriend (F20) and I (M18) have been dating for 8 months but she has never posted anything about us on social media and I have never met her friends or family. I am starting to get really worried about it.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating since February of this year. Since the beginning I noticed she wasn't too much of a social media person, but she will definitely post about things she likes or places she visits (Example: concerts, beaches, soccer practice, yoga class, etc...). We go out about once a week because we live 2 hours away since I moved for college. When I take her out, we take pictures every here and there, but I've noticed that she only posts or publishes the ones where she's alone. She doesn't have pictures of me anywhere on Instagram or Facebook, she also doesn't have anything signaling that she is in a relationship either. Sometimes she publishes pictures that I took of her either while we were out or even pictures I took of her in my car but she won't even tag me or mention me at all. Even when I try tagging her on my pictures, she removes all the tags or anything similar. I have brought it up before and she always says something along the lines of ""my social media is just for fun, nothing serious"", ""the people I most care about already know about you, there's no need to publish it"", and even asking her to tag me in a picture results in her feeling controlled or that she's being stripped away from her freedom. She is so adamant about feeling controlled that I am starting to feel afraid to even talk about the topic anymore despite it being a legitimate concern to me. 

I am starting to get really nervous and even a bit anxious about it because I don't know any of her friends or family. In the other hand, she knows all of my closest friends, my parents and even some of my grandparents. While I was away on vacation (2 month summer vacation) she kept mentioning how her friends wanted to meet me and that she wished I was there and wanting to go on double dates with her friends and their boyfriends and stuff like that. I always responded positively to this because I was very happy to get involved with her social circle and getting to know her friends. But once I did come back, she has never mentioned anything or brought the topic back at all since then. I always make special emphasis on wanting to meet her friends and how much I'd love her to introduce me to them and although she agrees on it, she has never actually done anything about it. She's never actually invited me with her friends, she's never organized anything for us to meet, and she has never made any plans involving me and her friends. 

What are some possible scenarios that could be happening? I really am trying hard not to feel like she is embarrassed or ashamed of the relationship but everything I see is pointing the other direction. Is there something I'm missing or not understanding? 

I appreciate the help in advance, feel free to ask for any other details that I might've missed or that could be relevant

Today, we had a fight and she said ‚ÄúAre you stupid?‚Äù I stopped and asked ‚Äúwhat did you say?‚Äù And then she said it again and I just stopped and walked away. I havent talked to her since. The reason this hurts so much is because I already have really low self-esteem about my looks and intelligence. I was also bullied a lot. So hearing it from her just makes it hurt more. I‚Äôve told her this and its fine for a week. Then it happens again. I get other names too such as ‚Äúbeing a baby‚Äù ‚Äúare you an idiot‚Äù ‚Äúhow dumb are you‚Äù etc. during our fights.

t3_dlhy76,We didnt had sex but i(19) think my girlfriend(19) is pregnant,"So me n my girlfriend have been together very recent, a good couple of months, and we have been doing only oral because we live in a very strict environment and i dont want to have her doing sex at uncomfortable places like the toilet n all that. I think she deserves more, some place comfortable.

Recently her body has been acting weird; sore body, frequent bloated and binge eating. She even puked a few days ago. Its only been a couple of weeks(less than a month) since we first start doing stuff. Her friends are saying that its cus its getting close to her period but i cant help but to feel really really scared.

Both of our parents are really strict and religious, and our siblings are very judgemental. Im scared that its gonna make her feel sad or angry or depressed. Im also scared of hurting my parents. I love her very very much, shes been really great. I told her abt my concern because its been getting into my head. She was very chill abt it, she can even laugh abt it. Which made me happy and concern. Happy cus shes not taken back like i am but concern if shes just being like that to comfort me

Im willing to take responsibility and I promised that ill be with her evry step of the way and what ever decision she makes, ill support her financially, be it keep him/her or abortion. Ill try to find a way. We plan on getting married once we graduate n have a stable job. But if this is true then...now idk.

I dont mind it being her because, she is the most amazing girl ive ever met. Shes so beautiful and nice and supportive and accepting. I dont want to ruin her life or make her anything other than happy. 

I know her dad is gonna slap me and i know my parents are gonna disowned me. Both of our friends will just think how idiotic we both are, just like they always do.

t3_dkixq4,Caught my (m34) wife (f30) cheating on me and she is furious with me,"A week ago my wife said she was going out with univesity friends after some volunteer shifts that she does. She said she would be home late and not to worry, after 11pm she said she was going to stay at her friends house and go to work from there in the morning. This is very unusual so I started calling and messaging like crazy hoping that she could just take a taxi back. She refused to pick up the phone and told me not to worry. 

She continued to refuse and was obviously v drunk so I became worried and very suspicious. Not proud of it but I went into her emails and checked the rota for her volunteer work and sure enough she wasn't on it. This led me to check her Internet history and I found a whole heap of searches clearly indicating an affair.

I went to work that morning and she still wasn't back so I confronted her when I got home that evening. She admitted the searches and said they were just her fantasies and that she had been at an 80s night and nothing had happened. When I told her she hadn't stayed with at her friends she admitted that too but said she had been at the club all night and came straight home. Obvious lies as she was looking at hotels online and from card payments from our joint account I can see was not in a place that does 80s nights.

So I'm not an idiot and it's 100% clear what has happened but she will not admit it and becomes really angry with me when I bring it up. She says constantly that she stayed out and made the searches because I have never paid her enough attention and she needed more intimacy from me. 

I'm losing my mind because I still want to fix this but can't even proceed to the first step of accepting the situation (let alone forgiving her) as she wont admit what is obvious. Shes so angry with me and has recently told me she is scared of me now because I was so angry the evening after she was out all night. She doesn't look remotely sorry for how she has acted and now when I bring up the night she simply says I told you everything I'm not gonna talk about it. This,  even though her story is provably false.

I feel like I'm purgatory now. Together for 10 years and I don't even know this person.

I need to know is this kind of behaviour typical for someone who has been having an affair? 

If so are there ways I can get her to admit what she has done, or at least be willing to answer my questions in a believable way?

Is there a way I can move forward because everything I do is hitting a wall.",relationship_advice

t3_dlfc6h,[UPDATE]: My bf of 4 years wants to take a break and im worried.,"Original post in my profile.

I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend today....

I told him how this break was affecting me mentally and told him how it was unfair of him to do in the first place, how I didn't know what was happening and what to do and what was going on and how being kept in the dark was unfair to me. I told him I'm breaking up with him because if he is happier without me than I don't want to be the person holding him back from that and that we should have broke up when he said we need a break.

He agreed with what I said and was very stoic about the situation at first. I think to save face but also because he didn't think it was fair to cry in front of me because of all the pain he gave me.

I was very sad with the outcome. We talked a bit and ultimately I got out of him that he thought at the end of the break that he would come back home, but it didn't get to that point and that he felt like he confused caring for me with love for me instead, and how he still wants to be there for me even if it's just financially.

I asked him if I was a huge bitch to him if he would still support me and he said yes, that he fully expects that to happen anyway and that he wouldn't just abandon me.

Nothing is changing in terms of financial things, but he is going to live with his coworker while I live at the apartment on my own. He is coming tomorrow to pick up some stuff that he has left behind, and is going to come with his coworker.

Im extremely saddened by this, but I am happy that I made the choice to do it now instead of suffering further. I have been having mental breakdowns and it's extremely hard but I know this is what we need to do. He just isn't there yet in terms of experience with life and relationships so he doesn't know how to appreciate me since he doesn't know any differently. He's never had any kind of serious relationship so this is not surprising at all.

I honestly feel heartbroken, but at least I know what we are doing and he knows where we stand and what is happening. I'm so sad but what can I do. I would rather be alone if he doesn't know who he is and what he truly wants, even if all I want is to be with him. I think this is what is best.

We both cried and both lamented the loss of our relationship and our lives together, but maybe this is the wake up call he needs to be able to grow and learn. I still hold hope that he will come back because it's still fresh, but ultimately I know our time is up. Even if it's for now, or a few years from now. I don't know what the future holds but these feelings will pass with time...",relationship_advice

I have been dating Dave for two years. We‚Äôre pretty serious, and a few months ago we moved across the country to stay together after graduating college. 

For starters, I shave my armpits twice a week; I never let it get longer than mere stubble. A few days ago, Dave told me that he didn‚Äôt like my armpit hair. He said he didn‚Äôt find it attractive. Honestly, I was really hurt by his comment. It made me feel like he didn‚Äôt like a part of me. 

I asked him if he always felt this way. He said yes. I asked him if there were times that we were going to have sex, but he stopped us because of my armpit hair. He responded that my armpit hair is a turn off. 

At this point, I started to get mad. I told him that I don‚Äôt want to shave my armpits at all right now because it will feel like giving in to him. He responded that not shaving would be a punishment for him. 

Excuse me? How can a part of MY body be a punishment for YOU? 

Some time has passed since this fight, but it‚Äôs still not sitting well with me, and things are tense between the two of us. 

I told him that I was glad he felt comfortable enough with me to tell me. Still, I‚Äôm upset about what happened. I feel like he should have to change his opinion rather than me change my body. I feel so strongly about everything that has happened that I am considering breaking up with him.

t3_dlfa9p,"Girlfriend cheated on me, now has suggested an open relationship, saying she doesn't know what she wants","This has probably been the worst night of my life.

After sensing things are very wrong, I called my girlfriend and began pushing her on things she had said about ""not being sure what she wants in the future"", which is a complete 180 from even a month ago when she asked me if I would marry her (not in like a serious engagement kind of way, but in like a fun, daydreaming kind of way). Eventually, I got her to admit that she had cheated on me the previous week. Eventually after I was clearly upset, she started saying that she wouldn't cheat again (to her credit she has admitted how dirty she's doing me) but at the moment its very up the in the air (I obviously haven't been able to sleep).

I know there really isn't any coming back from this, but I just need to hear it from other voices telling me that I should just move on.

I seriously love this girl, I fully thought that we were gonna go all the way. I've never met anyone who gets me as closely, or makes me as happy. She says she still loves me more than anything, but that she feels like she is too young to be committing fully to someone (she is 21, me 23, so that's not necessarily wrong either). 

But I need to do the right thing for me. What do you guys think.

EDIT: we broke up today. We both said that we still love each other but at this point in our lives it‚Äôs probably not the best for us to be so committed. It hurts but I know she‚Äôs right to some degree. We‚Äôve said we wanted to try again if we both felt like we could do it at some point when we both have our shit figured out, but honestly I think that just a hollow promise meant to make things more amicable.

For the most part (like, honestly almost all of it), it's been wonderful, and she's the best thing to ever happen to me. We're both firey, passionate, stubborn people, and we've had our fair share of arguments. Recently, we decided to go to couples therapy to work on how we interact with these arguments. It got that every so often (less frequently than once a month) we would escalate really quickly into a horrible, draining, emotional shout-fest that would leave us wobbly for days afterwards. But we'd come back together after and talk about each others side of things calmly and in a constructive spirit and try and work out how we could help not go through it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been doing well with it and communicating well about our feelings. But she admitted to me that she thinks I'm manipulative -- specifically, that after arguments she would often find herself doubting herself and her side of the argument. She always talks through her arguments with her sister and her best friend, and she said they think I'm manipulative too. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has absolutely devastated me. I'm a bit of a wreck after hearing that, and I feel like I'm suddenly without a compass. I know that I can argue my side forcefully, but she gives back the same, and the idea that I might be manipulative is horrifying to me. I believe I'm a nice person, I don't harbour ill feelings about people, I kindof just truck on in a contented sort of way. I feel so judged, and I feel like it's really unfair, because my wife's support network only hears this one distorted side of me, through the lens of an emotional argument, without me being able to defend my side. When I've shouted at her, I'm the bad guy for shouting at her. When she shouts at me, I'm the bad guy for doing whatever I did to make her shout at me. She told me that if she says something positive about me after an argument, they think I've manipulated her into saying that. I've NEVER done or wanted to do anything like that. It's horrifying. It's not who I am. I'm so upset that someone could think that of me. And worst of all, I feel like its tainted my relationship with my wife and with her support network (who I've been friendly with throughout the relationship). Now I don't know how I can face them, because I'm going to spend the whole time dealing with social anxiety (which I'm not great with at the best of times) around how they see me and if they think I'm manipulating them. Or if we have another argument, how it's no longer just trying to resolve a conflict, but all my failings in that argument are being pored over and judged by people who think that of me, and fed back to my wife, and affecting her image of me even more negatively. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to resolve this now. I feel like being thought of as manipulative is an unassailable position -- how do you even show someone that that's not who you are? Everything I do and say, I'm now running through this mental filter of will this be seen as manipulative? What will my wife's support network say when they hear this? How can I possibly show that I'm not, in case that attempt to show that is seen as manipulative? If I didn't realise I was manipulative, how can I know whether any argument or point that I make is manipulating her? I thought I was just arguing my side -- trying to tell her why I'm upset in any argument, and trying to understand why she's upset. It never occurred to me that I might be seen this way, and it's kindof shaken me to my very core. I don't think I'm manipulative. I've checked out some other threads on red flags for manipulative behaviour and I don't do any of them. But now I'm just a bucket of self-doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I move on from here? This kind of came out of nowhere for me and I don't feel equipped to deal with it.",relationship_advice

So here is the situation, I finally have time to update you guys while I‚Äôm here in India.

So the Friday before I left, about 11 days ago My girlfriend and I decided to talk, more details from my 2 previous posts. 

( long TL;DR from the last 2 posts: my gf was upset with me since i was leaving for 5 weeks to India and wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk every day. I‚Äôm more chill with texting where sometimes i don‚Äôt reply right away, especially right after school or work when I‚Äôm trying to recoup, and she constantly texts me when she is not busy, and she gets mad when i don‚Äôt text back right away. The Sunday before I left she got made when i said i might to be able to be in contact everyday while I‚Äôm there since i don‚Äôt know my schedule for my pharmacy rotation in India. We got into and argument again on Wednesday, both time she brought up problems that i thought we dealt with like a year ago, but she still holds grudges over. She said that she was done and stopped talking to me both times, and the next day she would apologize and make me go on an emotional roller coaster)

I went over to her place on Friday to talk about the situation in our relationship. I told her what i had problems with and she told me what she had problems with. We both sort of have mental issue, mine more so anxiety and she has depression with which she is on medication. I want us to sort these issues and problems out before we got any further in our relationship, so I thought it would be best to take a break from our relationship while I was gone so we could think about ourselves and whether this is what we want in our relationships. 

This is my first relationship and her like 5th one. I think she was ready to move into a long term right away, wanting to get married after like 6 months.I‚Äôm not sure what she is doing but I started to write my daily thoughts in a journal and I plan to go to counseling to help with my anxiety issue. I‚Äôm not sure how to feel. I felt some sort of relief after the ‚Äúbreak-up‚Äù but I still miss her everyday. I love her, but  trying to take time for myself to really assess this relationship. I feel like i can‚Äôt really assess the relationship for some reason. Thanks for those who helped so far! And i hope to improve myself in the future",relationship_advice
t3_dl67ge,He is mentally abusive and is threatening suicide. What should I do?,"My boyfriend mentally abuses me all the time and always threatens suicide if I don‚Äôt relent to what he wants. Usually I submit and do what he wants because I don‚Äôt want him to hurt himself. Well we got into a bad fight through texting and on the phone and he said if I don‚Äôt do what he wants; he will kill himself. I was sick of submitting to him and tired of all the mental abuse. He said he was sending me pics of him hurting himself, so I blocked him because I didn‚Äôt want to see it. I also didn‚Äôt want him yelling at me and calling me names so I blocked him on text too. I am very scared though that he is going kill himself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I mean I do love him and that‚Äôs why I worry about him. But he demeans me and everything I do that‚Äôs nice for him is wrong. He also tries to change me. He won‚Äôt let me wear makeup, or certain things I like to wear. He won‚Äôt let me have any friends that are male, even ones I‚Äôve known since I was a baby. He won‚Äôt let me go anywhere without showing him proof that I‚Äôm not cheating. He also makes me check in with him every two seconds and if my replies are even one minute late, he gets angry at me. I‚Äôm afraid of him and yet I love him. Do you think I was right to leave?

We just got out of a game i admit i screw it up a little at the begining but recovered myself at the end she ended up very bad and we lost the game, its whatever to me but she takes it personaly or something always saying ""i do nothing ritgh, i always f\*\*\*k things up, i really just gave up trying to say otherwise she wont listen to me.

After she got out of the discord call she sent me a msg ""I want to kill myself"" i (and not the smartest move i know) told her to chill a fkng lot its just a game and tryed to call her back she didnt answer my calls i msg her back ""are you not going to answer me?"" she told me not.

Couple minutes pass and she sends me the next text ""This msg is just to remind you that if i don call you like an idiot you dont even care if i kill myself"" i tryed to talk to her but i really dont know what else to say,

I always have to be the emotional support or should i say all the fkng support because i have to find a  job so we can live together but i dont know if i want it anymore i dont know if i want to live with the fear of arriving home one day and she killed herself or something, when i feed bad emotionaly and talk to her she just say ""i dont know what to tell you"" and if we are together she just hugs me, it is usualy enough but what if it wasnt anymore.

I got A LOT of sht comming in my life im sacared AF and i feel like im alone 90% of the time i try to be strong but i have my limits.

t3_dlf203,Money.....of course,"My gf of years hasn't worked in a while. I've been working tirelessly nonstop to support me, her, and her kids. Here lately work has been slack and to make things worse I only get paid every two weeks. Most of the time she's lovey dovey and will talk, text, send selfies, and just be supportive. All of that just stops when I don't have the money to give her. She becomes angry and threatens to leave or perhaps do something out of the way to get some money. She throws the fact that she has kids in my face, which are not mine by the way, and that they will go hungry because of me. This happens all the time and she won't work herself to support her own kids but gets pissy at me for not having enough. We don't see each other often and she never wants to have sex or even hug. I'm almost at wits end with this and no matter what I say she will never try to look at it from my point of view.",relationship_advice
t3_dlf12u,I need your advice guys. M(21) not sure if I should start dating her.,"- [ ] Hey guys! I‚Äôm in a situation that I‚Äôve never been before, I thought maybe some of you had any experience regarding this, so I‚Äôll try to keep the story as short as possible and I want to know what you think. I‚Äôve met this girl in a club, knew her from before as she is studying in the same university as I do. We had a really good time, talked a lot, were making out a lot as we were quite drunk. She is really pretty and smart and I haven‚Äôt thought of it as a one night thing as I was genuinely interested in her and had thoughts of getting to know her better even after the night. She was on the same page, atleast that what she said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not actually going to clubs very often, this is the first time that I‚Äôm with a guy in a club‚Äù, something among the lines. So we got back home like at 5am in the morning, she lives in a dorm just next to mine. We went to my best friends dorm room as we thought we would continue drinking, but we just fell asleep together. In the morning she went to work and I was sleeping until the evening as I was still very drunk. The same evening as she got back from work and I was awake already, we met up just to smoke and talk. She seemed very insecure about last night, she was worried that this was a one night thing and was forcing me to ask her out on a date already. Everything is ok with that as I would do it, but while we were talking I got to know more about her and some things I didn‚Äôt actually like. The only thing that is holding me back right now is her previous relationship. I have no idea why she told so much about it, but what I know now that it was a really toxic one.I guess it ended like half a year ago. The guy was related to drugs, was abusive with her at times, although she was almost sure that the guy was the one for her. He also tattoed her name on his arm, which I thought is very stupid and scary at the same time. She said she haven‚Äôt been in a relationship since then so what I‚Äôm thinking right now is: is it worth to start dating her? As I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôm going crazy over her and her ex boyfriend might try to get back in her life and considering that he is from a really shady background it could cause problems. Maybe I‚Äôm paranoid so thats why I want to know what you think...

t3_dla6vz,I (17F) desperately want friends and I have no idea how to make them.,I was bullied at a young age and lived in a rural area so school or social outings were very rare and often unpleasant. I have siblings but they're much older and so I never really had kids to play with when I was young. I managed to make one friend and then I moved due to my parents divorcing and lost touch. Then as I finally settled in again I ended up moving two years later and leaving everyone I had come to know again. I'm now a Junior and I don't really know how to socialize. I desperately want friends but I don't know how to talk to anyone and I feel like even if I try they'll all think I'm weird anyways. Most people already have their own cliques and friend groups and it feels like I'd just be a bother. I'd really appreciate some ways to find activities that make me feel less alone or to even find friend.

t3_dlctae,He lied again and I am stuck,"So when my boyfriend and I started dating, my ex for some reason wanted to get close again, I wasn‚Äôt interested. He then decided to want to get close with my current boyfriend instead. My ex and I had an awful relationship - AWFUL.  I was uncomfortable with them being friends. I finally told my boyfriend and he said ok. Months go by and he is still texting and hanging out with my ex. I tell him it makes me uncomfortable again and he said he got it. About 6 more months go by and I see they are still talking. I tell him I AM UNCOMFORTABLE. I CANNOT BE WITH YOU IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. I made it clear this time. He seemed like he understood and said he wouldn‚Äôt do it again, sorry, blah blah blah. Well in august, I find out that he was invited my ex to go work with him out of state. I am hurt. He was mad at me and said it was stupid and that I‚Äôm controlling. We had a huge fight that ruined our vacation. At the end he said sorry and cried because he thought I was going to leave him. Well I probably should have. Today, he came home from work (5 days out of state). I knew something was off. He told me before that he was bringing two friends I know, but turns out he also brought my ex. I‚Äôm heartbroken. Before he finally admitted it, he called me crazy and asked why I always think something is wrong.  I feel like an idiot. I left, I‚Äôm staying at my parents house but I have to drive back tomorrow for work. I also go to school there so I feel so stuck. I don‚Äôt want to drop out again. But I don‚Äôt think I can ever trust him again. He lies to me all the time about small things. He said it‚Äôs my fault, I make him lie. I hate this. I‚Äôm sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense.

t3_dleyfr,"My ""ex"" (M22) sent me (M29) the Happy Birthday message, best way to proceed?","I had a massive post written, but it got too lengthy and unwieldy. I also lost the will to conclude it since my relationship with this man seems to be an up/down rehash. If you're curious, I can send it you (unfinished) in a PM. Here is the issue summed up:

I got to meet someone earlier this year but any potential of that blossoming into something more was squashed due to situationals - timing, geographic location, vastly different backgrounds, upbringings and lifestyles. Granted that these don't have to be dealbreakers but in this case, unfortunately, they have impeded how we've communicated and related with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

There's been a pattern of arguing, apologies, grand gestures\*, forgiveness, communication, rinse-repeat. For about 3-4 times now, across a timezone and a 5hr flight away. And we are not in an official relationship - we have probably physically seen each other 10 times and spent two nights together.

\*he has spent money on a plane ticket, concert tickets, food and lodging (while he sojourned in my city)  - and he is a man of limited means so it's overwhelming that he's chosen to do these things.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, he sent me the sweetest birthday message today, on my 29th birthday, after almost a month of no-contact from me. We quarralled, then he wouldn't take my calls. I sent him a text telling him how he wouldn't hear from me, though I wished him the best. I have kept my promise, but he's reached out every week since our falling out. He sent me several (objectively heartbreaking) voicemails with apologies, as well as apologies via text.

&amp;#x200B;

I am old and dating/relationship-hardened enough to understand that this isn't healthy, or good for either of us. I have done a lot of mental work (before I met him) to make peace with how we enter life alone, and leave it alone. Those whom we are lucky to walk with, even temporarily, are blessings. I am not wanting this man out of a fear of being alone.

It just makes me very sad, it hurts me to know that he is in as much pain as he is. I hate that I am the cause for his pain. I know he'll be okay eventually, but it is horrible to see him go through this. I want to reach out to him, even just as a friend (since I don't see any other future between us right now due to sheer logistics) but I suspect it will make it worse for him.

Sorry if this seems trivial. I am usually so sure about myself and what to do in these matters, but for once I am at a loss. There was very less feedback on this from the internet so I figured I'd make a thread. Lots of the dumper reaching out to the dumpee on birthdays, but none for the inverse.",relationship_advice

I told her distinctly NOT to tell J, as they will certainly break up. A few days go by, I‚Äôm having pretty good time in life, just relaxing, when I‚Äôm texting CL. We were in the middle of talking when she said that she told J the joke and that J broke up with C. Now as you can tell, I was pissed.

t3_dlewq2,"Me [22F] and my boyfriend [25M] have recently started to say, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. Why does it feel so weird coming out of my mouth, even though I know I do?","Hi all,

TL;DR
I‚Äôve never told anybody in my life that I loved them. Never to my family, friends, myself. I love my boyfriend, and I still tell him that I do, but my mouth jumbles when I say it and my mind stiffens up for a split second when I do. Do I just need to get used to this sensation?

So, I‚Äôve never told anybody that I loved them. I have never told my parents, my siblings, my friends. I‚Äôm talking about my family has tried to bribe me with trips to Disneyland when I was little just to try to get me to say it, and I never could. I know that it depresses my parents a bit, and my brother gets annoyed with it sometimes, but I physically cannot say it to anybody except for my boyfriend. Hell, I can‚Äôt even say it to animals.

So, pretty recently, my boyfriend dropped the ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù on me one day while we were hanging out together, and it took me a good ten minutes maybe to say it back. I remember the moment that he said it, and I asked him if he meant what he said. Of course, he said yes. And I had to double check and ask if he was serious. Once again, he said of course. And my entire body just froze up. I was absolutely, 100 percent happy in that moment and all I could do was smile. All I wanted to do was say it back, but my body physically couldn‚Äôt. I know that this part wasn‚Äôt from me being so happy, since this is how it feels when my family tries to force it out of me. 

Eventually, I said it maybe ten minutes after he said it to me, and he got really happy and I was living in pure bliss at that moment, but ever since that morning, every time I say it I‚Äôm overly conscious about how I say it. One time, I‚Äôm too loud and just kinda blurt it out. The next time I‚Äôm quiet and choke of my air and words. 

It‚Äôs definitely not that I don‚Äôt love him, nor is this some crazy scenario where I‚Äôm trying to convince myself that I love him. He‚Äôs the best person that I‚Äôve ever met. 

I am told that I‚Äôm loved every day whenever I visit home by my family, although my household is still extremely toxic. I‚Äôm not conditioned to not hear the words, so perhaps I‚Äôm just not used to me saying them? 

I know that I‚Äôm sort of using this subreddit as sort of a therapy session right now, but I‚Äôm sort of speculating, and it‚Äôs always nice to get an outside opinion from strangers in the internet. 

So the question is: Does it feel weird to say, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to my boyfriend because I‚Äôm just not used to saying it, or is it something else?

So i‚Äôm a big metalhead, and this girl and i met thru a mutual friend at a show a couple months ago. 

We don‚Äôt talk much, we text here and there but nothing consistent, but we share a love for music and for the Hulu show Letterkenny.

Long story short, we were talking about possibly hanging out, and it came up that there is a concert on Wednesday that we both were interested in. 

She was on the fence, but when i offered to drive her, she agreed. She also mentioned how our mutual friend offered to drive her but she didn‚Äôt want him to.

Anyway, i find her super attractive, and I‚Äôm not sure if the allusion that shed rather go with me than him means shes interested or if the mutual just annoys her or something. 

Currently the plan is to go to the show and then see if she wants to grab a bite to eat after, but I‚Äôm still on the fence with that.

t3_dlevcf,I'm(28m) tired of feeling not enough for my girlfriend(27f) because of her huge cock fetish. I think it's time to cut my losses.,"The extremely few people in my life I'm close enough to me to be able for me to ask for advice on this touchy subject have been less than helpful. All of it basically chalked up to: It's just porn, stop being such a little bitch. All that's done is make me feel like I'm in the wrong.


But this isn't a very long relationship in the grand scheme of things, just over 2 years long. We're not married nor have kids, don't live together or anything like that to make a possible breakup complicated.

A few months ago I went over to her house to wait for her to get home from work, her request. I went onto her computer to play a game. She didn't turn it off properly or something because when it came on the web browser was open with multiple porn tabs open. All of her searches had to do with huge cocks. These guys had ridiculous sized dicks and it made me feel like shit. I don't even watch any porn by myself anymore because my mind always goes back to that moment of the utter gut wrenching realization that I'll never be what she wants.


I don't know exactly how big my dick is but I do know that it's normal sized. I have become physically incapable of having sex with her, my dick goes limp almost as soon as she touches it because my mind keeps diverting back to the porn, which is making me feel even more inadequate then I already did. Because obviously she gets disappointed and retreats to that porn as soon as I'm not around. So yes, porn can satisfy her and I can't. I'm willimg to bet I never satisfied her. I kinda resent her for it quite honestly.


A week ago today she asked me if I still liked her and if I was alright, stating that my sudden lack of sexual energy towards her was making her feel like she isn't wanted anymore. My negative feelings got the better of me and I snapped at her and asked her why the fuck I should want her when she wants what I can never give, then hung up on her. She rang me back to ask what the hell so I came clean about all of the above, all of it, if I mentioned it above; she's heard it. She's upset and apologetic. Though she's really got nothing to be sorry for. As far as I know, she doesn't know I'm planning on probably breaking up with her because of this, she's still very much invested in this. She asks me daily how I'm feeling, if I want to come over to eat etc. And she's also layed off of the trying to have sex with me, thankfully, though I'm not sure why.


There is 2 sides of me; one emotional side who wants to sit down with her and get passed this and forget it ever happened. The other logical side just wants to bail, put this shit behind me and move on, which is the side I want to follow. But I've never broken up with anyone before, I was always the one getting dumped so I don't know where to even start.",relationship_advice
t3_dl9xma,My mum is constantly putting my brother's responsibilities on me and I can't deal with her screaming,"Beware, this is going to sound like a teenage girl who is being hormonal...because it is.

I'm leaving to get on a cruise in two hours. I packed everything I needed, besides a few chargers that I'm using. My mum took it upon herself to pack EVERYTHING my 11yr old brother might want on the trip, with the only exception being a toothbrush. My brother asked if we still had a crossword book to take, so I went looking for it. My mum came and told me quite rudely that she threw it out ages ago and to stop making a mess, to which I responded by cleaning up and leaving the room. She then yells at me because I didnt pack my BROTHER'S toiletries. 

She's going to forget this all happened by the time we leave. How do I prevent this in the future?

TL;DR : my mum yelled at me because I'm apparently responsible for my brother's stuff.

t3_dl2d9h,"Me(34M) met ex high school girlfriend(f34) couple of months ago, been dating since, she wont stop talking about her ex(M34) and how sex with him was better.","Me(34M) met ex high school girlfriend(f34) couple of months ago, been dating since, she wont stop talking about her ex and how sex was better.

She, Anne, was the first girl I had sex with. Back then we went to the same school, had the same friends and times were good. The sex we had back then was mediocre at best. I was barely allowed to touch her from neck downwards. However besides that the relationship was good. We broke up half a year after I moved to another city to go to university.

It did not struck me too hard. I was young, well integrated in the new city and my parents provided enough money to party as much as I wanted..and I did.On one of those parties I met what I would still call the love my life. She was 18, hispanic and a regional champion in gymnastics. What I experienced then still gets me dreaming of how awesome love and sex can be. However she was young and ready to explore the world while I after all the partying realised that I had to quit my studies because it just was not the right thing for me. So we quit and I moved back to my home town.

Unfortunately instead of straightening myself up I started partying all over and really hit rock bottom one and a half year later when I nearly screwed up my second studies. In this time Anne was been caring for me nicely and we also made out from time to time. It was same as back in the day, but I mostly cared about having somebody to talk to and cheer me up. So, to me, she more and more became rather a good friend than a lover. As she kept pushing for a relationship we quit but were still friends.

Then Anne met Tim, the father of her child. He forbid her to meet me. Which I struggled with but fully accept today. Now her crazy times started. Tim has been an addict all his life and from what she has been telling me lately both were doing lot of drugs and had awesome sex. They did not preserve because Tim claimed to be infertile. However it turned out he was not. He got her pregnant without her knowing and until she found out, she kept doing drugs. Although the relationship has been a mess before, he threatened her to have the baby or he would leave her. She gave birth to the son and they broke up a year later or so. Now he is barely caring for the child and only paying minimum aliment cause his lazy ass only finds minimum wage jobs. Still he is spoiling the kid whenever he sleeps over.

So here we are me meeting Anne again. Things were ok, ignoring the fact that she is saying my life is sad as I am 34 and single who lives alone in a 3 room apartment. Ignoring also that she is constantly talking about Tim and sometimes comparing me to Tim. The other day however she overstretched things and told me sex with Tim was just so much better than with me.

I don't believe I am the freaking god of sex, but I am pretty sure that I can bring it if you let me. I am well in shape, got empathy and really like to give massages or just be intimate without actually doing it. For her it follows a strict scheme how it is supposed to be done and it is done in 15 minutes max. Now she blaming me for us having bad sex just does it for me and got me thinking for two days.

I really don't know how to proceed here. I think I should leave her, but I am 3, I want kids and this seems like my last chance.

Tl;dr

Met highschool girl friend, had bed sex then, having bad sex now. She is doing the starfish and tells me sex with her ex was just so much better.

t3_dlcmxt,Am I selfish for not being there for family?,"Long post. 

Last year (09/18), my sister lost her daughter at 1 day short of 23 weeks There was no other explanation than ‚Äúincompetent cervix‚Äù. After 6 rounds of IVF, she was finally pregnant &amp; we were thrilled. When she lost the baby (who was born alive, but didn‚Äôt have lung capacity so she &amp; her husband had to make the choice to pull the plug). I live across the country. I went back home &amp; spent a week with her, to help her feel somewhat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù &amp; finalize all details. Fast forward 4 months ‚ÄîI became pregnant after 3 rounds of IVF. My sister was ecstatic for me, as was my mom. At 18 weeks, my water also broke. The first person I called (while on the toilet, wondering if it was ‚Äúexcess pee‚Äù or my actual water breaking), was my sister. She panicked &amp; told me to immediately get to the ER. Low &amp; behold, my water did break due to my own ‚Äúincompetent‚Äù cervix &amp; that night, our daughter‚Äôs heartbeat continued to decline. The next morning, she was gone &amp; my labor was induced. By this point, my sister &amp; parents had taken an overnight flight &amp; arrived for the birth. Two days later, I was home, without a baby, in a lot of pain &amp; bleeding heavily. My sister had to leave due to work (she‚Äôs an attorney who just started at a new firm). The following weeks were a TRIP ‚Äîmy retained placenta led to me having not one, not two, but THREE d&amp;c procedures to get it all out --it was traumatizing. Our grief was postponed since we were so focused on my recovery. A few weeks later, my father in law passed away, it came out of nowhere. My sister flew out again (along w/my parents) because, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what family does.‚Äù I was forever grateful, as she was such a strong shoulder for us to cry on.  

\&amp;nbsp;

So now we‚Äôre in Oct. Last week, she went into the ICU due to severe bleeding. They couldn‚Äôt figure out why, so FOUR blood transfusions later, they decided an emergency hysterectomy would be best. She was devastated, but pulled through like the champ that she is. This past Fri. they did the procedure. What was supposed to take 3.5 hours ended up taking 9.5 hrs because her endometriosis had spread to most of her organs &amp; they were ‚Äúfused together‚Äù so they had to detach. Today I found out that her pain was so strong last night, she had to call an ambulance. At this moment, she‚Äôs in the surgical ICU, with tubes down her nose &amp; throat to help her breathe. Apparently she became infected with something &amp; her abdomen swole. 

\&amp;nbsp;

My husband &amp; I had planned a trip (months ago) to Miami for this week because this coming Thurs. would‚Äôve been our due date. We wanted to lay on the sand &amp; hear the ocean on that day. We don‚Äôt want to be home because we both know we‚Äôll imagine the ‚Äúideal scenario‚Äù in our minds. We booked a super fancy hotel (that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford if it wasn‚Äôt for our credit card points) which is non-refundable. We‚Äôre packed &amp; set to leave on Weds., but now I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty that maybe I should be back home. Maybe I should be there; but then again, what can I possibly do to help the situation? I feel like my sister‚Äôs husband, my parents, and other people (her friends who‚Äôve been messaging me, ‚ÄúWhen are you coming to see her?‚Äù) would think I was selfish for going to Miami to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. On the other hand, I feel like my husband needs a break after losing a baby &amp; his father within a matter of weeks. Normally, he‚Äôd book me the first flight out to see my family; but this time he‚Äôs adamant that we ‚Äúsee what happens‚Äù &amp; I go back after our Miami trip. I‚Äôm not sure if I should cancel our trip &amp; fly back home ASAP, or if I should go to Miami and see my sister &amp; family after. I can‚Äôt realize if I‚Äôm being selfish for not considering my sister‚Äôs health and taking a random trip, when I can be back home with her, or if I‚Äôm looking out for my own mental health and taking a trip w/my husband to heal from our own loss, which was devastating for us.",relationship_advice

t3_dletbc,Is my (18F) boyfriend (18M) being selfish regarding a severe phobia I have?,"This may seem strange to others but I have severe emetophobia (fear of vomiting). I get panic attacks or pass out when I see/hear someone vomit or when I vomit/feel nauseated. Its very severe, and I have been getting help for years (therapy, medication, etc.) however the healing process takes lots of time and I still have a far way to go. 

Because of my phobia, I have a hard time being around people who are slobbering drunk. Ive only recently started dating my boyfriend (2 months), and he invited me to his birthday party next weekend to meet his friends for the first time. I‚Äôve told him about my phobia before, but I don‚Äôt think he really understands the seriousness of it. He warned me that him and his friends will be getting hammered at the party. I told him that is fine, but to please pace his drinking so that he doesn‚Äôt vomit when I am there. He told me that vomiting is sometimes inevitable. I suggested drinking less, but he told me that 1.) he can‚Äôt really control how much he drinks (once he starts he can‚Äôt stop) and 2.) his friends will be ‚Äúforcing‚Äù him to drink a lot since it‚Äôs his birthday. 

I told him that if he‚Äôs incapable of drinking less to avoid vomiting then I might just not be able to come, and he seemed upset because of that. He doesn‚Äôt realize that I‚Äôm only doing that for his sake. I don‚Äôt want his party to be ruined, and I want him to have a good time without me having a panic attack. But at the same time, is it selfish of him to refuse to drink less so that I can enjoy myself too and meet his friends? I am stuck on how to handle this situation. Is he being the selfish and insensitive one for not taking my mental health into consideration?

t3_dl9tz6,Not great but not horrible,"I (32M) have been with my gf (29F) for about 5 years. We have known each other for a long time and had always been kinda interested in each other. It wasn‚Äôt until we were both a bit grown up that the stars aligned and we were finally able to date. 

The first year of the relationship was great. Sex was great, communication great. We have similar core beliefs so it‚Äôs been smooth sailing this whole time. We have gotten in a few big fights over the years but nothing serious. Neither of us are overly dramatic people so we are usually able to fix things pretty easily. 

Here‚Äôs my issue- every once in a while I take a step back and realize how unspectacular our relationship is. There aren‚Äôt really peaks or valleys at all. Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I don‚Äôt want artificial drama to give me higher highs and lower lows, but it just feels like we‚Äôre both sort of numbly going through this relationship. 

We‚Äôre there for each other and we talk but after the first year sex dropped off dramatically. We have sex maybe once every couple of weeks. I have to ask her when the last time we had sex was for her to realize how little we do it. She literally never instigates and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve talked to her about often in hopes that it would change, but it‚Äôs been a good 2-3 years since I first brought it up. 

Now we started out as good friends. The only big thing that changed when we started dating was the amount we hung out and, of course, the sex. Since sex has dropped off a lot I‚Äôm realizing that it just feels like we‚Äôre friends hanging out, which isn‚Äôt the worst thing but she has never really showed me passion or romanticism despite me doing these things a lot. 

I‚Äôm wondering if this is the right relationship for me. There‚Äôs a lot more going on with it, but without sharing a lot of specific details (she‚Äôs on reddit a lot) it just feels like the relationship has flatlined and no matter what I do to instigate a new flavor into our relationship it always falls off because of lack of follow up on her part. It‚Äôs almost like she doesn‚Äôt have the attention span to dedicate to me and us a unit. 

I feel like I‚Äôm in a hole and I can‚Äôt see the situation clearly.

t3_dlerp1,My boyfriend was kissed by a man and I don't know how I should react,"So I'm a first time poster/ long time lurker, posting on my second account, since it has less identifying info, and English is not my first language, posting on mobile so sorry for formatting, all that jazz.
Last night my boyfriend sat me down and told me he made a mistake, that last week he went to a uni party, got really drunk and then apparently a guy danced up on him and then that guy initiated a kiss (just a small peck on the lips apparently, he said it lasted for maybe 2 seconds) and my boyfriend did not push him back or told him he had a girlfriend, he just accepted the kiss. Of course, I asked my boyfriend if he still identifies as straight and he said yes and that he feels disgusted with himself.
But my problems with this situation go deeper than just the kiss. First of all, I didn't even know he went to a party, I just thought he was at home like always. Ever since he has started Uni, he feels like he has to go to every uni event there is, and it really pisses me off, because when I started a year ago, I did not feel as if I had to go to all those parties and since they are just a reason for getting drunk I also don't really see them as something worth my time. He can have a different opinion on this, but still I would appreciate it if he made more time for me and didn't do everything Uni related, since we went from seeing each other 4 times a week to half of that ever since he started...
Then, just one night after the party, he made out with me and things got pretty steamy. I wonder if he felt any remorse about the kiss, since he just went ahead and made out with me right away.
The next thing though, takes the cake for me. Just three days after he got drunk and was kissed, he asks me if he can go out with friends to a party. I didn't know anything about the other party, so of course I said he can go. But I don't get how he can just go to another party and get drunk there within the same week of making such a grave mistake?! I told him that and he said he didn't know why (Great answer). I also asked him, if the guy that kissed him were a girl, if he would have reacted any different, he said yes he would have told her he has a girlfriend, when she danced up on him.
Now it gets kind of crazy... I was acting up a bit, after we've had most of the talk, giving him back all the stuff he ever gifted me and saying that I feel like from his actions he doesn't feel remorse. And then he said he's had it and takes of his shirt and reveals that he has cuts all over his forearms. I have a history with self harming and these cuts definitely weren't a ploy to get attention. There were lots of them, all over his both his forearms. He has never done this before, only I have. At least now this has shown me how others feel, when they see you are self harming and, even though it's been 2 years since the last time, I will never ever do it again. He also promised me to never cut again. But still, I find it sick that he would cut open his arms just because he felt remorse over a kiss, when for me the kiss isn't even the worst thing, it is lying to me and breaking my trust.
So basically, I still love him, we've been together for 3 years after all, but I don't know how I should cope with all this. I would have wanted him to say that he has a girlfriend, I want him to tell me when he goes out to party, I don't want him to drink so much that he loses control, I would have wanted him to show remorse from the moment he had the kiss, I want him to not self harm.
He wants to sleep over tonight, but I'm not sure I want that. I can't imagine a life without him, I love him so much. But right now, it just feels wrong to act as if nothing had happened, and that's exactly how he acted after we kind of reconciled yesterday, he called me late last night though and said he wanted to hear my voice, so that's different, but still when he was still at my house and I kind of forgave him he started behaving like usual.
I just don't know what to do. At the moment, I can't really imagine kissing him, I did last night, but whenever I did I had to imagine someone else doing the exact same thing just a few nights ago. So maybe the kiss really is important to me after all.
I hope maybe someone understands my situation in this mess of a post, and could tell me how I should proceed or sort my feelings out.",relationship_advice
t3_dlerky,Should I distance myself from my Mom?,"My mom [45F] lost her job a year ago and hasn't been able to find another she can live on due to her education and severe pain from fibromyalgia and spinal issues. After so many rejected applications and interviews she's really deteriorated. She doesn't have family she can stay with and feels like she's alone. Most of the pain she does show is taken out on me [17F]. main things:
1. She's usually incredibly depressing to be around. the whole situation has warped her body and aura. it's dark and glum. but more than that it's like being in a hospital. she just sits there trying not to cry. it's really hard to watch your mom deteriorate. and I can't just ignore it or constantly cry with her. so it's really difficult for school (trying to finish questbridge stuff for ivy schools) but obviously I'm not gonna leave her there by herself.
2. Tiptoeing around her feelings: started crying because I got mad at her for licking an almond and dipping it in step dad's/siblings' cocoa powder jar (like what??)
3. Very quick to anger. she's always had a bad temper, but now I hang up on her and she texts me angry paragraphs about disconnecting my phone. tonight it's calling the police because I called her crazy and didn't leave the bedroom door open and to use them to make me go to her apartment with her (she insisted on house sitting me at my step dad's while he's out of town). she also still compares me to my abusive bio dad. I've been ""manipulative"" or tonight ""controlling"" like him. I don't think I am. it just hurts. she just screams about how I don't have any empathy and don't understand. I finally told her tonight I was done. I can't handle tests and college apps and ap work and her

I feel like I don't even have much of a mom anymore. I'm tired of going back and forth, and it's already been like this to a less extreme degree for a couple years. obviously I keep choosing to stay around and support her but we still have arguments. I know it's cold, but can I leave? I could always stay at my step dad's* indefinitely (as long as she's not angry so she doesn't threaten to call the police to make me listen) and then have little to no contact in college.

[yes this relaxes the rule a bit. An update on the Updates Rule is in here as well]","**TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

t3_b2nc2f,[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened‚Äîyour account‚Äîwith each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift?

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

Yeah, this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub's been around for almost a decade. It's also long overdue considering we're at over 1.3m subs and y'all are always so grim. shrug. ~~***Comments open for 72 hours or less,***~~ edit: which is to say that we'll take feedback on this and whether there _should_ be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give... but honestly, we'd rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason. If you disagree with a downer, just downvote it.

t3_dljukt,"My GF (28F) Joked About Male Enlargement Pills, I (28M) Brushed it Off.... Two Days Later She Says ""I Bought You Something..""","The title says it all, but I will elaborate a bit more here:

On Saturday, my GF of two years did something that somewhat hurt my feelings/destroyed my manhood a bit. She sent me a link and to some of those male enlargement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. I thought she was just joking so I ""LOL'd,"" said no, and brushed it off. When I saw her yesterday (Monday), she said ""I have something for you."" To my surprise, she pulled out a bottle of those pills.

I said, ""What the F\*\*\*, are you serious right now? Really?"" She said, ""Relax I'm not saying you are not big enough. I just want to choke on an extra inch or three of you. I thought you would be cool with it."" I said, ""First of all, that is not for you to decide. Secondly, why would I do that for you? I'm comfortable with my endowment. Lastly, IF I were to consider this as a possiblity, you do know all of that is false adverting right? That stuff does not work."" She said, ""There is only one way to find out. Here, take them."" I told her to leave and have not uttered a word to her. My phone is still blowing up with texts and calls. From the texts and voicemails, I can tell she did not expect me to tell her to leave. I kept cool as all of this was happening because I thought she was still kidding...

It irritates me that she did this. I wouldn't say she isn't happy with my size, but clearly her actions are alluding to this without her having to even say it. My question is, dear Redditors, am I overthinking/overreacting? I am considering ending it. She has apologized but I fear the damage is done. What she did was uncalled for and should only be done if one is insecure about their size. I still love her, but this stings still! Should I break it off? What should I say? Is there a way to recover from this?

P.S. I did tell her, ""OK, I will take the pills, but only if you get a boob job."" She said ""Yes because I love you."" üòÇ

**UPDATE/EDIT 1**: Wow. This shit blew up faster than my penis if I would have taken those pills for 30 Days. **MANY of you provided great feedback. THANK YOU**. Yes, her and I are having a serious discussion about it tonight. I texted her during my lunch and she keeps apologizing and reminding me that no matter what she still loves me and that she should have realized this was not a good idea. She asked if I could talk to her on phone for a min or too and I agreed.  I took her call. She's devastated and said that she is scared I won't trust her nor want to be physically intimate with her. She is very upset so I calmed her down. I told her I love her but that this needs to be seriously discussed and find a way to move on. Like may of you suggested **I WILL NOT NOR PLAN ON TAKING THEM.** And to everyone who said she is stupid/idiot, I get it. What she did is indeed stupid but she is not like that 99% of the time. Also, those of you how think this is a fake post: Kindly fuck off.

**Update/Edit 2:** Getting a lot of ""what is your size"" questions. I have nothing to fear. Here it is: **5.1inches and proud of it.**",relationship_advice
t3_dlklea,My dad falsely accused me of molestation and now wants me back in the family.,"So this is quite a long story and I‚Äôm new here so sorry if I miss something or edit back. 

Back in 2017 I went on a family vacation, important people and age at the time myself (21m) dad (40m) and sister(15f). Somehow on the last day of this vacation my sister came up with this idea that I molested her. This was completely random, no context it just happened. My dad came to me in a flurry of anger and very aggressively threw against the floor and wall without saying anything. Once I was able to sit and respond with probably like wtf he told me what she said. I was stunned and confused and explained that I never had done anything to her. He then told me my best friend (who lives 1000 miles away and had never met my family) told my sister I did it because I confided in my friend. This was the first major red flag for me that this wasn‚Äôt a joke or some shit but they were being serious. 

Now for some context. I am the oldest of 9. When I was 5 I myself was ‚Äúsexually abused‚Äù by my ex-stepsister (moms ex husbands daughter? She was maybe 12 at this time) but I am the oldest. I didn‚Äôt know any better and it never bothered me a ton later on. We were kids. Saying that I was still the oldest and when I got to that 10-12 range I definitely got curious about human anatomy and I will say it here. I was a peeping Tom on my 6 year old sister. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. What I was looking at. Or what to do with it. And I never touched her. I was nothing more that a curious 10 year old child who was the oldest in his family. It took me a long time to be willing to accept that. 

This happened the second to last day of vacation. I slept alone and flew home the next day, they drove. I lived alone and hardly saw them due to distance but tried to go twice a month. I stopped contacting them and they all blocked my phone number, fb, etc. except my dad who continued to text call and harass me. My sister went to the police when we got home where the story changed to she found it in my phone which could have been possible as she had my old phone. I had to deal with state and dcf, and then the local police from the town we grew up where this would have happened. I met with an officer after playing phone tag for nearly 2 months with him and dcf leaving eachother voicemails a few times a week. When I met with him we talked over what happened on vacation, the accusations, and what happened to me as a child. That was the end of it from the police. My dad continued to text me so I blocked him finally. About 6 months go by and he calls my work phone which was emergencies only. I had forgotten he had that number. He basically said that the DA was filing paperwork to have me arrested, the fbi would be taking me and some other over the top stuff. It all seemed way too much but I called that officer I spoke with to check in and he had nothing new for me he said to call the da office so I did and there were no cases in my name or my fathers(he would have to represent my sister). After this we went quiet for 6 months until my aunt(mother‚Äôs side) called me cause she ran into my dad at Home Depot and he told her all these terrible things I did. She asked me and I explained everything and she was all good and no longer concerned about me with any of it. Then a few of my friends found out when he told them. Then some people I work with. After about a year I quit my job to get away from it all, changed phone numbers and moved across the country. Right when I moved I found out my sister just had a baby, at 16. 6 months later my dad emailed me asking to go see my grandfather on his deathbed and my sisters baby ‚Äúlet her show you the baby, let her tell you about the baby she really wants to‚Äù we‚Äôre his exact words. I said I moved across country and couldn‚Äôt and never responded again. 

Now it‚Äôs been about a year and he has been emailing an old email I use for spam for a few months begging me to text him or call him as he can‚Äôt live like this anymore and needs me back. I‚Äôm honestly torn on if I should reply to see what he has to say or just keep moving forward with my new life. So... any advice? 

Sorry if this sounds like a random jumble of words I don‚Äôt have time to proof read atm and will answer as much as I can‚Äôt after work. Thank you

Edit: a lot of people are saying to see therapy or confused on the timeline. 

She would have gotten pregnant roughly 4 months after this happened, lining up nicely with her 16th birthday. There‚Äôs no way I can be accused of being the father. 

Second, the first year or so until I moved was hard. Leaving my job which I loved was hard. But moving across the country to where I always wanted to live was extremely therapeutic for me and I took a few months here to recollect and find myself. I may still go to therapy in the future but honestly I‚Äôm happy with my life and without them. 

Lastly, the consensus is don‚Äôt contact them as it could be a trap, if I did I would use a fake number or throwaway phone. And it would be to see what he has to say, if he would apologize, not to go back.

Edit2: Wow this has gotten way more attention than I imagined. Let me clarify a few things here, 

No i did not have pictures of my sister, The accusation of her finding stuff on my old phone was that I had made a note in the notes app directed towards my best friend. Her 3rd and final story change was that she found this message(First being my best friend told her, Second saying she found it in out texts), I honestly don't know if this message exists but it very well may as she(my best friend) did know about this already and helped me cope because damn it was hard to accept that I looked at someone as a child. 

My sister, to my knowledge, did not want to press charges. However her BF (who was on vacation with us) told her to go to the school counselor, who then is forced to contact police, DCF, etc. That is how it got to police, not her directly doing it. My dad told me to turn myself in before any of the police debacle started which I didn't, I then played phone tag with DCF and the local officer of our home town for over 2 months, they only called me at 4pm on friday's. We left lots of voicemails. But because my sister was underage my Dad had to be in-charge of case decision making or something, not entirely sure, hes never been the best at texting which is where i got this information from before blocking him and changing numbers. 

Thank you all so much for the kind support, I never would have imagined that this would be my first post on Reddit. And thank you those asking for more info, I wrote this in a rush on my lunch break as I've been thinking about it for a few days and just wanted to do it and there is so much more little detail that could be added but i simply do not have the time.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnu8d,Girlfriend (20F) and her friend (20F) 'tested' to see if I (20M) I would cheat.,"Errr I really don't know how to feel. Though I'm definitely disappointed if that makes sense. My gf asked to meet up at her friend's house today, so I did. She wasn't there yet, but her friend was. We chatted for a while and she started being playful, but I brushed it off. Playful turned into flirting and I felt super awkward. Before I got up she kissed me and I left right after that and called my gf. I explained what had happened and yeah turns out she set me up. I couldn't believe it tbh, I thought she was joking at first. First she was mad that I 'kissed' her friend, though she literally grabbed my head and kissed me so not much I could do. And I don't even feel the need to defend myself because what? I've never heard of someone setting up their SO and it hurts that she has so little trust in me.

Where do I go from here. She has apologized (half-assed that is) but I kinda don't want to speak to her right now. We're together for 6 months.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmbdf,My fiance broke up with me because my parents have a non conventional marriage...,"We've been together for 6 years. We've known each other for another three years before that, so 9 years total. We're getting married in February. Or we were, I don't know any more. We're visiting my parents to meet some more of my extended family, so they get to know him before the wedding. My parents offered to host us, and we've been staying in my old room. I'm \[F29\], he's \[M32\].

We are staying with my parents. My fiance wanted to stay at a hotel, but I thought it will be fun to sleep in my old room. And to be here with my mom and dad one last time under their roof before I become a married woman.

My parents have been in a non conventional marriage for a long time. It was a shock for me to learn about it, and I learnt to cope with it. I am not necessarily comfortable with their life styles, but I can't do anything about it. They basically go on dates with other people, spend time with other people, sleep with other people. Had to learn it when I came home a few days earlier from a trip with a friend's family, and my father was sleeping next to another woman, when I was 16. I freaked out then, and my parents had to explain to me it was all fine.

So my fiance could not sleep last night, and went outside for some fresh air because he is not used to sleep away from our bed back home. And he found my mom kissing another guy in my parent's foyer.

So he freaked out, started yelling at her, came and woke me up, demanded I call my father and tell him he found my mom cheating on him.

So my mom had to explain to my fiance about my parent's non conventional marriage, but it didn't go well with him. And once it seemed like he is calming down and starts to accept what my mom was telling him, he figured out I knew about their marriage, and he started freaking out on me.

He told me that he can't trust me any more, that he was set up, that I insisted we stay with our parents so that I can ease him in the idea, so I can enforce my parents principles on our own marriage, and I simply can't get through to him.

My fiance has been cheated on before, his parents have divorced because his mom cheated on his dad, and he doesn't have a good relationship with her, he could barely stomach the idea of having her come to our wedding.

He went to a hotel for tonight, and said he will be leaving back home tomorrow. he's not really answering his phone or texting back.

he says he needs to reevaluate our engagement, that he doesn't think he can marry me knowing I approve my parents marriage style. That I wanted to manipulate him and introduce this life style in our relationship.

The truth is I am ashamed of my parents and their relationships, and I had no idea they will behave like this while my fiance is around, let alone sleeping in their house. he simply doesn't believe me because I haven't talked about it since I've met him. It's not something I find easy to talk about, and the less I think about it the better.

How can I talk with him? I have no interest in my parents style of relationship, I am fully dedicated to my fiance, and I have never been interested in another person since I've met him.

I don't want to lose him over this stupid thing, and I feel ashamed he had to find out about my parents like this. I'd have preferred he never knew.

Please, if anyone has any ideas, I am interested in any suggestions.

Thank you.",relationship_advice
t3_dlmm59,My [26M] girlfriend [26F] moaned the name of a male friend [26M] during the most intimate sex we've ever had.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. She told me that she loved me a few months ago. I am in love with her as well. We do almost everything together -- we are also coworkers (I am leaving the job in December, thank God). I've never once doubted her commitment to the relationship. I have never really felt jealous of other people hitting on her. Never had the urge to check her phone or any of that toxic shit. Cut to: 

This weekend, where my girlfriend was the Maid Of Honor at her best friend's wedding. We'll call the bride ""M"" and the groom ""A."" It was a wonderful weekend, beautiful ceremony, etc. After the reception, we went back to the hotel and had pretty intense sex. The kind where you're talking about a future together, etc. During this  incredibly intimate moment she moaned ""oh my god, A."" 

Me and ""A"" do not have the same name. There could be no mistaking it was his name. Immediately I got off and packed my things into my suitcase. I left and headed to the airport. 

She has been insanely apologetic and says she has no idea where this came from. I don't believe her and ""A"" have ever had sex. My girlfriend insists that they've never had sex and she's never even thought about him like that. Obviously there is now plenty of doubt in my mind. I do not trust my girlfriend anymore. I feel betrayed. Hurt. And I don't know how to get past this, or if I can get past this. 

So naturally I came to the internet for advice. Thanks.",relationship_advice
t3_dljm8e,Brother (28M) who sexually assaulted me (21F) as a child is trying to contact me,"Warning, this post contains sensitive, personal information. 

I had a rough childhood in the sense that things were unstable, my father abandoned us (I was 6) and my mother was an absent heroin addict. My father was very abusive and beat my brother and me for the dumbest things (not finishing dinner or not cleaning our room) but he left us for what I‚Äôm now sure was a prostitute. I grew up in the suburbs of a somewhat large city with just one older brother (I had a half sister I met a few times, also a drug addict like my mom, died from overdose). For most of my childhood my brother took care of me and made sure I was safe while our mom was out getting high. However, when I was 8 years old and he was 15 it was like he became a completely different person. My brother started to get into trouble at school; in one case he brutally beat a boy two years his senior almost to death. He got into a lot of trouble with the cops, but my mother was not there to guide him down the right path. He started down an ugly path of destruction (arson, robbery, and joined a gang). 


NSFW WARNING

I remember the first night he violated me and probably always will despite years of therapy. We shared a bedroom in a shitty apartment (mom was on welfare, we were poor) and he came in on a school night probably around 11-12 at night. I woke up when he was trying to sneak in, but he wasn‚Äôt very inconspicuous and I am a light sleeper. He stood probably a foot away from my bed and I could smell alcohol on him. It was weird because he spoke to me very softly and what seemed gentle and not hurtful when he said we were going to play a game and I had to wear his bandanna as a blindfold. I thought we were going to play hide and seek (I was 8, didn‚Äôt know any better) but he covered my mouth with his hand, lifted up my nightgown, tore off my underwear, and molested me for what felt like an eternity. I had no idea what was happening at first and didn‚Äôt even understand when it was all happening but I cried and whimpered and my body was so tense. He molested me with his hands and a metallic, cold object. I think I eventually passed out from the pain and not being able to breathe (he covered my mouth the whole time). When I got up for school the next morning he was already gone, my mother was gone too, and I was home alone supposed to get myself ready for school (not unusual for me). There was blood in my sheets and I was very confused. I went to school as normal but sometime in the afternoon there was blood in my pants. I went to the school nurse who assumed I was having my period, gave me pads, and sent me on my way. A couple months went by before he attacked me again, this time I didn‚Äôt smell alcohol, he just seemed so angry and was being very aggressive. He did not blindfold me or cover my mouth this time, instead he penetrated my anus as I cried loudly and begged him to stop but mom wasn‚Äôt home and nobody was going to save me. I tried to fight back by scratching at his face and trying so hard to get out from under him but he was already 6 feet tall at 15 years old and I wasn‚Äôt strong enough. The next and last time he attacked me he was 16 and I was 9. I think I got somewhat of amnesia during the time that passed because I didn‚Äôt remember what happened until he raped me for the last time and it all came back. My mother came home with some random druggie guys and they were probably all getting high in the living room when I was getting ready to go to bed. My brother was not home and who the hell knows what he was doing, I don‚Äôt even want to know. When he got home my mom was already passed out I guess, but her boyfriends were still there. This time was the worst and the scariest. He got ready for bed (he usually just came in and crashed or spent the whole night out) so it was weird to me he was taking a bath and brushing his teeth or whatever. He came into our room and I was just starting to fall asleep. He climbed into my bed and I laid as still as possible pretending to be asleep. He whispered in the dark to me in the most terrifying and dead voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. He grabbed my throat, mounted me, and penetrated my vagina. It was so sudden and so vicious and awfully painful. I screamed this time, for the first time I was able to find my voice, and one of my moms boyfriends came bursting in yelling and beat the shit out of my brother. My brother was arrested and I tried to forget everything for the next 12 years. He was put in juvey, had to attend therapy, and diagnosed with antisocial disorder. I was amazed how much my mother reacted and how she changed completely, she attended rehab (first time left, but second time stayed and got so much better). We moved into a new apartment and stayed there until I was 17. I graduated high school and moved to a new city to go to community college and work full time. My mom passed away from a long battle with HIV/AIDS when I just turned 18. My brother ended up in prison for a few years doing time for robbery. I struggled with my moms loss especially since we were closer now and she became the mom I really needed. My brother got out of prison a week ago and since has tried to make contact with me. I live on my own and was terrified when I got a missed call from him asking if he could borrow money. His ‚Äúapology‚Äù sounded very sincere on the phone but he was always a charming kind of person and I have no intention to see him or help him. I contacted the police but there‚Äôs nothing they can do for now and changed my number. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to forgive my brother and he‚Äôs probably just trying to use me. I‚Äôve been staying with my friend to be safe. I don‚Äôt know what to do. So much shit has happened in my life it‚Äôs really affecting me and I feel like I‚Äôm going to have a full blown break down. 

TLDR: brother sexually assaulted me in childhood, he went to juvey and prison, got out, and is now trying to make contact with me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqmsl,I (25F) looked through my boyfriends (25M) texts and saw degrading and hurtful messages he sent to his friend about my body/other women,"I want to start by saying yes I know it was wrong to look through his phone and is a violation of privacy, I normally wouldn‚Äôt but I was sensing he wasn‚Äôt happy/ satisfied anymore. (Also he has looked through mine in the past - not that that makes it right for me to do it) 

So he was talking to his friend through text and said ‚Äúman fat asses make me melt. __‚Äôs ass got fatter over our relationship but it‚Äôs just not the same as those oversized throw pillows. Lmfao cut the titties off and n put it in the ass. I could have a a flat chested girl if she had all the ass in the world.‚Äù  (side note if you didn‚Äôt gather I have really big boobs and a plump but def not huge butt) 

Then the friend said he saw a Jessica lookalike at work (Jessica is a girl my bf briefly/ almost had a thing with before we dated). So my bf said ‚Äúman I miss Jessica‚Äôs booty. She‚Äôll hit me up once in a while but I have to keep it insignificant lmao‚Äù  then he talked about some girl at work he vibes with really well and misses when she‚Äôs not at work, sounds like he has a crush on her although he didn‚Äôt say that flat out. 

So I‚Äôm just really torn.  I love him to death we‚Äôve been dating four years, we moved across the country together and I don‚Äôt want to break up with him, but at the same time I don‚Äôt think I can feel sexy or confident in bed anymore. I know it‚Äôs normal as human beings to be attracted to other people, but I wish it didn‚Äôt have to be said in such a degrading way. Is this just normal guy talk for men in relationships? He hasn‚Äôt cheated, so am I overreacting? Appreciate the help.",relationship_advice
t3_dllky8,My ex girlfriend is telling everyone I cheated on her.,"My ex girlfriend or two years has decided it'd be fun to drag my name through the mud, for some context; she broke up with me because she no longer saw a future with me due to me not being a Christian. After she broke up with me we tried to remain friends (unsuccessfully) she would tell me about random dudes she was trying to sleep with and even once called me crying because she got high and fucked a guy 5 years older than her. Anyway (sorry off topic)

 I offhandedly mentioned that at one point whilst we were dating I started daveloping feelings for one of my friends, because of these feelings I told my friend I needed to take a step back and they were understanding. Then my ex imploded in on herself like a dying star, she called me a cheater, told me to kill myself, told me she still loved me? It was weird.. but I thought ""eh she has a boyfriend I have a girlfriend what does it matter""
Boy was I wrong! She has now told everyone we've ever been friends with that I cheated on her and a lot of them have sent me lovely messages telling me what a horrible monster I am for cheating on her. I even got a text from her grandmother telling me how disappointed she in me.

t3_dlgx21,"My bf (24m) gets angry every time I (21f) say no to sex, and the other day I felt like I had no choice but to do it","Edit  (And update I guess). - I‚Äôve read each and every reply and want to thank people for being so helpful and telling me like it is. I am going to call my family and ask for help in getting out. I have a place to crash while I look for another place. I appreciate all of the advice &lt;3

Also wanted to explain a few things. Some people can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôd even bother posting on here, or that I must know it‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm ridiculous for even questioning it. It‚Äôs also ironic to me that I would have to question things like this, being a psychology student doing my postgrad. But the truth is, this was the first incident like this where I was actually scared of him. Everything has been subtle up until that point and I was in shock and not thinking clearly about it. It was confusing and scary and after the initial shock wore off I started to realize this wasn‚Äôt something I could excuse. 

I knew from the disgusted responses that this was definitely not okay so it confirmed what I thought and I knew the first thing I needed to do was to tell my family so that I would have their support. It‚Äôs also more difficult I find to see things clearly when it‚Äôs happening to you personally - it would be much more clear if a friend told me it happened to her. Sometimes you‚Äôve gotta be told the truth by other people when you‚Äôre doubting your own judgement. I deleted the post because I feel I got the answers I need from it, so thank you. 

The second thing is that weirdly I feel like the issue was not sexual incompatibility. We still had regular, almost daily sex up until now, and the only reason it‚Äôs not more than once a day anymore is because I had so many deadlines to meet in college all at once and didn‚Äôt have the time or energy. So I think maybe this wasn‚Äôt about the sex but he has issues of his own and he made it about the sex. Not that it matters either way I guess, because it still doesn‚Äôt make it right.",relationship_advice
t3_dlq5zk,I'm in a nightmare...I need help,"I haven't slept properly in days. I can't eat. I can't drink. My anxiety is through the roof. My family doesn't know. I come from a very religious family. It's a long story but here goes:

I'm a 27 year old male. University educated. Healthy, fit. I have a career, I'm financially secure and fine. I support my younger siblings financially. I have 5 younger siblings all in their late teens to mid twenties. I live with all of them, its the culture I grew up in. You don't move out until you're married. I'm single, never married. I've never been in a serious relationship before. I'm definitely religious, but not a virgin.
This all began when I began working for the government with in a department I won't mention due to privacy. I was there for a year, worked 40 hours a week, kept my head down, etc. Then around Jan 2019 my boss was leaving to another department. I applied for the position but didn't get the job. Instead, they hired a new girl from the private sector.

We were around the same age. She's only 2 years older than me. But we couldn't be any different. She's white, tattooed, atheist. I'm Somali (black), Muslim, I introduced myself and she smiled at me. I tried to speak but I stuttered (I grew up with a stuttering problem but I outgrew it, however it comes back from time to time). I hurried back in my desk in embarrassment.
The first few months were normal.It was a huge learning curve for her. A lot of people questioned the hire but she quickly proved people wrong. She was smart, quick thinker, witty, no filter (once you get to know her).

That winter, I came out of the office one Friday afternoon and saw her car wasn't starting. It was super cold, and I gave her a boost. She was incredibly thankful and hugged me. I didn't think of it at all and went about my business.
Every month I have our monthly 1 on 1 meetings to discuss my performance. At first it was business as usual. But as the months wore on these meetings became more and more just as talking and catching up. She would ask me questions and we would chat about virtually anything. I also knew for a fact that she didn't do this for others. She was extremely professional with them. Again, my naive self didn't connect the dots. I know, stupid.

Meanwhile, at home, my mother is a commanding presence. I'm a 27 year old grown man and she lets me be usually, but still annoys me. If its after midnight she still calls asking where I am. Its super annoying but I love her to death. She's also been pushing me to get married. She keeps telling me that she knows many young girls back in Somalia that would be interested. I laugh it off but I knew she was serious.

Anyway, my boss at work would message me on the MSN chat that we have set up at work. It was just a casual conversation. One day when I was talking to her (I stutter and sometimes talk fast), I mentioned my brother, she misheard and thought I said my ""brother in law"". Her entire expression changed, as if it bothered her if I was married. When I clarified that she gave me a beamed smile. Hr smile was very attractive to me.
Then she added me on facebook. We chatted some more. Just friendly things. I considered telling a coworker who I trust, but I figured I couldn't do it. Too much gossip and just wasn't worth it.

Then came a celebration this past summer. A coworker invited all of us to Boston Pizza and many people from work came. I never drank a sip of alcohol in my life up until that point. I felt a little hazed but since I had half a cup I was still pefectly ok. I realized it was only me and her walking out together. There was a cab right in front of the place and I got in. I thought she was walking me to my cab but she went in the cab too. She gave the driver the address. I was shocked. Stunned. Mystified. When she touched my leg and started messaging my thigh I had a huge boner and couldn't control myself.
We went back to her apartment and had sex. Incredible sex. And yes, I used protection. She was so attractive it was mind boggling. She said she would get a tattoo with my name on it on her ass cheek. That turned me on more. She taught me different positions I didn't think of before.
I spent the night with her. The I panicked. I looked at my phone. It was 430am and I had 34 missed calls from my mother. I called her back telling her I was with my friend and would be staying at his for the night. I texted my friend and he covered for me. I know its pathetic at age 27 but what can you do.

The next morning I left and she kissed me goodbye. I left with regret because I went against my religion.

But it didn't end there.

The next working day she walked by my desk and handed me a small piece of paper. It had her number on it. I texted her and we swapped all of sorts of stuff to each other.
Long story short, I spent a lot of time at her apartment for the next 3-4 months. At first, the thrill and excitement was amazing. But then I began to really like her. But I was torn. I love my family too. But there was no way in a million years my mother would ever accept a her. Especially given that she's atheist.
Then the nightmare really began: I got a text from her saying she wanted to discuss something. I honestly thought it was because she wanted to end things. Which hurt me, but I thought it was for the best. When we did meet, she started with ""I didn't have my period this month"". It still didn't click for me. Then the following two words gave me a heart attack almost.

""I'm pregnant"".

My world shattered that instant. I thought to myself, ""how"". I've used protection every time I've been with her. But that didn't matter.
Then it hit me what I've been doing. I've been sleeping with my boss for 4 months now, putting both of our careers in jeopardy, and I've gotten her pregnant. To a girl my mother would NEVER EVER accept. Not only that, but this is not how I wanted to have a child.
But at the same time, I do like her. She's incredibly smart, attractive, fit, and really caring. However, with that being said, she can have some violent outbursts at times. She's not a morning person and can get extremely moody. But nobody is perfect.

She told me she is having the child whether I'm going to be involved or not. She told me she has feelings for me and is willing to try a relationship but not at this point in our careers at work. Abortion is out of the question anyway, its against my values and beliefs.

She told me I should tell my mother, but I don't have the stomach for it. I love my mother to death. I'd take a bullet for her anytime. But this would break her heart. She is incredibly religious and I know her. SHE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THIS. I don't want to burden her more, she has already been through a lot.

I like my girlfriend I guess you can call it, but I don't love her. I care about her future and her well being, but I'm conflicted if she's the person I want something long term with.

What should I do? I'm ready to be a father, but not like this? My family will disown me. They wouldn't want to meet her. My community will shun me.

I've never been depressed like this before. Any solid advice would be appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_dlgs6u,Me (25m) and my girlfriend (21f) had a huge fight regarding her upcoming birthday due to different expectations.,"Hello everybody!

Im posting this from my throwaway for obvious reasons.

I will try to keep this short. Yesterday, I confronted my girlfriend about her odd behaviour over the course of the last days. Initially she said that everything was fine and that she is just feeling a bit ill (flu season). After I kept asking (since I knew something was up) she told me that she is disappointed with me because I am not spending her birthday with her. 

Short disclaimer: her birthday is in 2 days and of course, since I know it means a lot to her, I did not make any plans for that day. However, I have 2 lectures at university where attendance is mandatory (note: in our country you can miss 2 appointments. However, if you miss more than 2, you will not pass the course). Knowing this since weeks I told her that im gonna prepare breakfast for us, then head to uni around 9.45 and come back around 2, to spend the afternoon with her. 

Back to yesterday! After she told me that, I was quite buffled since I made a point of making time for her on that day. After asking what she meant she replied the following: ""You obviously dont care enough, otherwise you would skip those classes and spend the day with me.""

After that I tried to talk with her about it, her expectations and how self centered these demands are (imo). She then left the bed and slept on the couch, since then we dont talk anymore.

Am I wrong for thinking that her behavior is really ungrateful and inappropriate?",relationship_advice
t3_dlhuug,He Pretended the Proposal was a Joke incase I was rejecting him.,"So 2 years ago my SO(27M) at the time Proposed to me(30F)
It was my Birthday, we were sitting on our bed just chatting and he pulls out a ring and asks.
I said Yes, followed by lots of excitment/shock and said something along the lines of ""omg really?"" In a happy way not a condescending way if that makes sense.

He then turns around and says the entire proposal was a joke.
He starts saying things like ""do you really think I'd propose to you with a crappy ring like that?"" And ""If this was a real proposal I would've put in more effort, not just done it at home"" etc etc etc.

Cue me getting absolutely furious and heartbroken all at once. The Proposal/Ring was my Birthday gift, he hadn't gotten me anything else or done anything that day.
He then bursts into tears and explains that His anxiety took over, he thought I was going to say no so he started saying all these things to protect himself. He does have a LONG history of anxiety, which I completely understand. He can get overwhelmed just going out in public as he feels people are judging him.

I just honestly don't know how to move past those memories of what he said.
I barely wear my ring as whenever I look at it all the memories come flooding back and I feel sick.
I feel like it's tarnished my Birthday too, its just such a horrible thing to remember each and every year.
Part of me understands the anxiety he had, the other part thinks WTH you put in zero effort then sabotaged it, is that all I'm really worth to you?? 

He wants to get Married, and he's quite excited and happy to plan things and look towards our Future.

t3_dlnnrc,I need help I can't breath,"I have no idea who to talk to about this. I don't even know if I can at all.

The father of my daughter and me had a rough patch, fighting nonstop, him calling me names and just generally having issues. We recently had a few conversations and we decided to make things better. I really thought we were and I was happier.


I feel sick writing this. I don't want to spell it out or think, I just found out two hours ago but I just don't know where to go. I can't think straight.

We live together with my parents, us upstairs them downstairs.

My now ex boyfriend worked on our car outside at night and my mother brought him some food out. Later she came back out and apparently he hugged her in a none decent way, kissing her neck and then putting his hands on her back underneath her clothes. He tried to kiss her. She was frozen before but when he tried to kiss her, I might puke holy shit, she pushed him away and left. For the last two and a half weeks she approached him repeatedly trying to talk how this was inappropriate and what the fuck he was thinking. Apparently this happened before some time where he hugged her and she felt it was too close? Not a friendly hug but more close and intimate and she just left immediately. Thinking he felt down or explaining it somehow in her head. After that last incident she couldn't anymore. She was crying. She was convinced that it was somehow her fault. She tried talking with him which he avoided. 


She talked to him today while taking a walk with our daughter while I was still working. My daughter is 1 year old so she doesn't understand. No worries about that. 

Anyway she kept asking for an explanation and he kept saying it wasn't her fault but not saying anything else than he just wants to forget it. 


She told me today. She said she doesn't understand why he didn't talk to me first because she told him that she will talk to me about it. He didn't. I was shocked. Speechless. My heart was beating and racing so fast I thought it would trip. 


I went upstairs and told him to leave
He seemed absolutely awful and sad but not surprised. I kept asking him for what happened and all he could say under tears was that he has no clue how it all lead to it, why one thing led to another while they were in the garage but it somehow did and he was sorry and he doesn't know what to do. 


He left. I feel like puking. I don't know what to do. There is no relationship anymore. I broke up with him obviously. He kept saying that it wasn't only him, he said she hugged him first and kissed his cheek and said that it wasn't in an only friend's way. 


What the actual fuck. 


I knew something was up but never would have guessed that.

I never would have thought he would cheat he loves his daughter to bits, we really did make an effort he kept repeating he loves me. He wish she never came outside. I just don't know what to do. Please help..

I don't doubt my mother. She is a Saint she helps so much and she would never lie about that. It's just hard to hear and I honestly wish she was lying.

I don't know what to do... My daughter is sleeping next to me and all I want is to run away.


In one way I wish he would be by my side now and hold me, how fucked up is that. I wish this is all a dream a shit dream that I wake up from. Please let this be a dream.",relationship_advice
t3_dld53s,"I (28f), a new home owner, am thinking about breaking up with my low-income boyfriend (26m)","Ever since I bought a new home, the relationship between my partner and I has taken a nosedive. I have a stable job and decent income, which my partner of 3 years has always called attention to. Whenever he wanted me to pay for something,  my partner would often say to me, ""you earn 4x more than I do, you can afford it."" I have paid over half of our rental fees in every rental we have lived in, even though he could afford it if he wanted to. This has been a touchy issue in our relationship, and looking back, I feel like I have been manipulated into paying more than my fair share. He also often brings up the point of being ""egalitarian"" with expenses, but I would like to save for myself.

In our last rental, my partner paid $600 while I paid $800 for rent PLUS utilities. For my new mortgage, I will be paying $2500 a month,  which would be affordable to me on my own, but it would almost match my budget - I'd barely have anything to save. My partner, who doesn't know what he wants to do career wise (he says he wants to be a climate change advocate for his dream job, and truly thinks it's okay to pursue a passion job instead of make a decent income) just took a job that pays $1000 a month through Americorps (this is a one year contracted position). It's a supervisor position, which he says will come in handy later in order to apply for  ""dream job,"" whatever that is. He also has a side gig that helps him earn $75 a month. My partner wants to only pay $600 rent, no utilities, while living in my 3 bedroom house.

So, I got a roommate, which my partner is still deeply opposed to. I needed to save money to pay for home repairs. All I asked my partner to do was to pay $700, a flat rent amount for my house, no utilities, and he freaked out and said I was sucking him dry. He said that his monthly budget would be $950 if I charged him $700 rent - $150 of this budget being misc. expenses. He has $3000-$5000 saved in his bank account. He also dog sits occasionally and receives money from that. I don't understand why he can't even pay me a decent roommate rental fee. 

Another thing is, because I now have an asset, I brought up the possibility of a prenup if we ever got married. My partner also freaked out to this, and said that only non-trusting couples get prenups. 

Am I a terrible human being for wanting my partner to pay $700 for rent? He says I'm greedy, but am I? I love some qualities about him, but not how he views our financial differences.

Update: Many of you have posted concerns about  my financial decision with the house, and I want to let everyone know that it's not like I would go into debt if I live in it on my own. I could afford this home, entirely on my own. I would like to fix up this house and make it personal, so I do want more saved up for that reason.

Second update: He agreed, before I bought this house, that if I bought a house, he would live with me and pay $700 rent. He knew I was going to buy a house. He still ended up taking a lower paying job anyway, and now he want to lower the rent. There was a verbal agreement, and I shared the process with him every step of the way.",relationship_advice

t3_dlr2b7,Is it bad/petty to refuse to date a coworker solely because they are a single mother?,"I originally posted this in the AITA sub but it got removed by the mods, so I‚Äôm reposting here hoping for a further discussion. The few people who were able to comment on my post in AITA said I was not TA but I want a bit more insight.

So there‚Äôs this coworker of mines that seems to be very interested in me. I say seems because she is overly cheery and playful/flirty with EVERYONE but recently she‚Äôs been overly flirty and suggestive with me‚Äîto the point where others around the office are jokingly calling us a couple already.

The thing is...she‚Äôs a single mother and that is something that‚Äôs a hard stopper for me relationship-wise. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing against her, her past, what she has/hasn‚Äôt done in life and it has nothing to do with her. It‚Äôs nothing like that. In fact, she‚Äôs someone whom I genuinely want to remain very good friends with and be part of my life. It‚Äôs purely a personal choice; it‚Äôs part of my criteria for what I‚Äôm looking for in a partner. Much like how some people won‚Äôt date others who are taller than them, or from a different religion, etc..

I personally just don‚Äôt find it fair that if I was to get in a relationship with her I‚Äôd essentially have to ‚Äúshare‚Äù her with her ex, her lawyers, and her child. (Her ex is a deadbeat who doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with her or the child but her parents are helping fund the legal battles so she is constantly in and out of court and speaking/seeing him.) I also don‚Äôt want the child to be accustomed to having a father-figure/male role model in their life only to be disappointed if the relation doesn‚Äôt work out. It really wouldn‚Äôt be fair for that child, and I would feel horrible if I had to disappoint them or something. Plus, at this point in my life I just really, really, don‚Äôt want any children, even biological ones.

It‚Äôs been a tiring past week and a half or so having to change the conversation if anything even remotely having to do with relationships, romance, or sex comes up (which is often because she always brings those things up in a flirtatious manner when speaking to me) or having to find a reason to leave the room if we end up alone together. And it really doesn‚Äôt help that other coworkers are constantly egging and teasing us to ‚Äúmake it official already‚Äù.

I‚Äôm essentially just ignoring the situation hoping it goes away but I know that‚Äôs not the best way to handle it but I also don‚Äôt have the heart to tell her the truth and possible hurt her feelings especially seeing how genuinely excited and happy she seems just talking to me.

So tell it to me straight Reddit: how best should I handle this and, IATA?",relationship_advice
t3_dlmofm,My (M23) gf (F21) is moving into a flat with at least 3 other guys without telling me anything,"This is a throw away for obvious reason I just forgot to add the tag on the account name, sorry for that. Anyways, this has been upsetting me for quite some time so I would love to her your thoughts.

So my gf and I have been together for a little bit over a year. We've had a long distance relationship and would see each other about once or twice every two months for a weekend and for the holidays. Now she is moving to a town about an hour away from where I live to study there. This is where the problem starts. 

She is going move into a university accommodation, which she will share with 4 other people who already live there. Yesterday she went to check out the flat (even though she already agreed to move in no matter what) and it turns out that she is going to move in with at least 3 other guys maybe even 4. While she was there I was texting her asking how it was and who her flatmates were. She took a long time to reply and then said that she had met 3 of them and they were all very nice but she didn't tell me anything about their sex. I expected the flats to be separated by gender so I didn't even worry about it. But then later when I asked her in person she told me, that she'd be living with at least 3 guys. I was really shocked by that because I honestly was not expecting it. I told her that I didn't really like the idea of her living with a bunch of dudes but she just ignored my concerns and told me she would take the flat because it's cheap. 

It's not like I don't trust my gf or anything but she has always been really good with guys and tends to quickly become friends with them. She's pretty decent looking, into video games, likes sports and is pretty much drama free which seems to be attractive to a lot of guys. When we started talking about her moving closer to me we agreed to see each other every weekend with mostly her coming to my place because it's cheaper (her uni pays for a part of the commute) but while we talked yesterday she also said that it's probably best for her to only come by every second weekend or so, so she can ""bond"" with her flatmates and get to know people at uni.

So I think what I'm trying to say is that I'm pretty sure she won't stay faithful to me, she's always had a lot of male friends and when she used to live further away there were times where she would go out with other male friends and not even bother telling me in advance or just say ""hey I'll be going out today"" and not even mention the sex!

So how can I tell her about my feelings and maybe persuade her to move into a different flat. Or should I just call it and break up with her before she cheats on me?",relationship_advice

t3_dl02bm,"My mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, I need advice","So I will try and keep this short.

I have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced I chose to live with her, I have always trusted her and so on.

Now we have never been rich, but we got by, I have always worked since I could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

Now because of this I quickly started saving my money, pretty much, I would usually save up at least half of what I made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when I moved out and such.

So I turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so I wanted to see how much I had saved.

Well you can see where this is going, I looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so I freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""Some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so I yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. She started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. I know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, I mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. My dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

Well this was 2 weeks ago, I have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

In the meantime I have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

Now here is what I said, untill I have every penny back I wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do I doubt I will ever forgive her. I need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",relationship_advice
t3_dlrgsn,How can I(18M) Assure My My Girlfriend(18F) She Can Come Over Any Time She Wants To My Place,"So I‚Äôll begin by giving some backstory. Me and my girlfriend both attend the same university and she lives on campus housing and I have my own place close by (not on campus). She spends the weekdays on campus housing but weekends at my place or back home at her parents places. 

I always make sure to make it clear to her than she can come by anytime. When she comes over she always tries to help around, just last weekend when I came home she had washed my bed and folded everything for me. I let her use my washing machine and dryer because why waste money every time on the campus one, but I didn‚Äôt except her to wash my things for me. She also uses my kitchen to cook something and she always asks me first if she can use it, even when I‚Äôve made it clear that she can. And every time she makes something in the kitchen she always tries to make something I like instead of choosing herself. A couple weeks ago she made some food and immediately told me to try it before she ate it herself. So I kind of had a feeling that she felt bad that I was letting her do all this. 

Just this past Sunday when my girlfriend was leaving to go back to campus. She asked me if I can come over during the week and stay with her overnight since it gets dark really early these days and campus is pretty dead at night. So I went over to her place and spent the night last night and don‚Äôt get me wrong, campus housing is not that bad, but it‚Äôs still really small. She was however really happy. So we were just laying in bed cuddling and I asked her if she wanted to spend tonight at my place instead. 

She said she didn‚Äôt want to and I asked her why. From there she explained she felt bad that I was doing so much for her and she wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me (not true at all, she does so much for me) and she didn‚Äôt want me to think she was taking me for granted. I felt so bad when I heard that because she does so much for me and she‚Äôs so caring of me. I told her and assured her that that was not the case and I love having her come over to my place. 

What can I do to assure her that she can come to my place anytime and especially with it being close to winter, I don‚Äôt mind her coming over. In fact, I want her to come over more. How do I make it clear she owes me nothing in return and her just being there is the best thing in the world. 


TLDR 

Gf feels bad that she comes over to my place too much and feels bad that she can‚Äôt do anything in return. In reality she‚Äôs amazing and does so much for me. How can I assure her she owes me nothing in return and she can come over any time she wants.",relationship_advice

Sunday afternoon she said she needed time to think if she‚Äôs happy. She claims I have done nothing wrong. I asked when she will be back. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be a day, week or month. I asked if we were still together and we would remain loyal and no dating or anything of the sorts. She agreed. She left and I was in agony. I felt like the world was collapsing in. I got a text the next day while I was at work saying she was at the apartment. I rushed home and held her. We get to talking asking about if things have improved. She told me she went to a friends house, and then to a co workers house. (She has no close friends). She got drunk at the co workers house and slept with him. I find out and lose it. We eventually calm down and I say that I‚Äôm willing to forgive her and if she‚Äôs willing to go to couples therapy. She agreed instantly and we just held each other. 

Today as I woke up and finding some therapy locations she came out and said that she‚Äôs still not sure if she‚Äôs happy. She said we have (had) a perfect life with perfect pets, location etc. but she‚Äôs not happy where she is. I then told her what do we do? After lots of talking she is unsure if she still loves me and wants to take time to think about it. In 2 weeks she‚Äôs going to let me know if she still has feelings and if I do. 

Right now I have feelings and want to get back together. But my brain tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm scared alone and living with a friend at the moment. Any advice is welcome.

His parents are avid donors so I told him to ask what theirs was and I could give him an idea of what his would be. They both sent pictures of their donor cards with their blood types on it. I did a punnet square and give him 2 outcomes. Wanting to know for sure, he had the doctor type him at his most recent appointment. The blood type the doctor gave him is impossible based on his parents. To double check, I made a date day of giving and we went to give blood together and while we were they I asked them to type us and give us cards, same blood type as the doctor gave him.

His mom has always talked about how she isn‚Äôt sure of her ancestry so I mentioned we got him one and asked if she wanted to order as well and she was very against it because she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant the government to have her data‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm not sure if she is aware of something and doesn‚Äôt want anyone finding out, or if she truly feels that way. She didn‚Äôt seem to know that blood types are able to be figured out by genetics. The whole 23andMe thing happened slightly before the blood typing, and his sample has been submitted so we‚Äôre waiting on the results.


When my fianc√© asked why he didn‚Äôt have the types I told him he would have, I simply told him that I messed up and crossed them the wrong way (he doesn‚Äôt know how to do the squares so he shrugged it off and went about his day)


Now I‚Äôm in quite a pickle with what to do. I‚Äôve stumbled upon business that clearly isn‚Äôt mine to know. However, if I ever found out that my fianc√© knew something like this and didn‚Äôt tell me I would feel so betrayed. He submitted his 23andMe sample already and now I‚Äôm at a crossroad of what to do because while it‚Äôs unlikely, it‚Äôs possible that relatives may come back on his report and they won‚Äôt be people he knows.


At this point I feel I only have a couple options and none of them sound great.

-talk to his mom first since she would know most about it, and let her talk to him

-talk to him first and let him approach his parents about it

-don‚Äôt tell him at all and risk a relative of his that he doesn‚Äôt know showing up on 23andMe, and also letting him continue to falsely assume he knows his (genetic) family medical history as we venture down the path of children and growing old


Any insight would be appreciated. My last resort is not telling him. It‚Äôs making me sick to hide this from him, and I know if this were reversed and I were to find out, I would feel like everyone im closest to is suddenly hard to trust.


EDIT: wanted to add that I have known his family for 10 years and we are extremely close. My relationship with his family is as important to me as my relationship with him, and I am afraid if I harm my relationship with his family, it will affect us, and vise versa.


TLDR; fianc√©s blood type isn‚Äôt possible based on his parents blood types. I‚Äôm the only one who knows this based on genetics. 23andMe sample was submitted before this info was stumbled upon, and were waiting on results of 23andMe. At a crossroads of what to do with this info as relatives he may not know could show up and he will wonder why. I don‚Äôt want to hide this from him for the rest of our lives",relationship_advice

He let me know he was really frustrated last night (we‚Äôve been dealing with our cat‚Äôs fleas for the past month) and he hadn‚Äôt slept well the few nights prior.

Mad at others for complaining about their problems which he found insignificant(crushes, tests, etc.).

t3_dlqmmd,My (32F) daughter (14F) is unmotivated and doesn't seem to care about her grades,"I'm hoping to find some people that are currently going through this with their teens, or perhaps were like this themselves in high school.

My daughter just started her freshman year of high school. To provide some background, she's always struggled in math and science. However, she still made an effort to do her schoolwork. However, I started noticing in middle school, she started slacking on doing homework. It got to the point where she didn't do it at all, and would lie and say she did. Of course I then found out when her teachers and or counselor told me. It got so bad that she was going to be held back in 7th grade (but did not due to me changing her schools). I figured a lot of this contributed to the private school she was in (NOT a good school), the unhealthy relationship with her dad (emotionally abusive) and not enough support on her dad's side. I took her full time and her dad only saw her on weekends. 7th grade her grades went back up.

Right when she started 8th grade, I got a job opportunity in Oregon and my daughter was all about moving. We love it up here, and my daughter flourished in 8th grade. Now, she's in 9th, and she has an F in all classes except two easy ones. I don't know what to do at this point. A part of me wants to punish her and take her phone / laptop away, but I feel like this won't get to the root of the cause. I'm thinking of bringing her to a specialist to see if there is a learning disability at play. I've seen her do homework and she cannot stay focused. She never seems concerned that she has missing homework or assignments. That is her major problem...she doesn't get things done on time and as she gets older, I feel like she needs to be held accountable for her actions or lack thereof. She doesn't seem to understand failing her classes will lead to summer school, and then if she fails that, leading to being held back. She will come home and I'll ask if she's done her homework and she lies and says yes.

Also, to add insult to injury, my daughter has three, yes THREE academic support classes. One to help with math, one is study hall, and one  helps with all subjects. It baffles my mind how she is still doing so badly. Socially she is great, we haven't had any major issues up here. She just wants to be on Tumblr and Discord chatting with her friends and not doing work. I'm hoping I can get some honest genuine advice on here! I don't want to be a tyrant parent but I don't really know what to do anymore.

t3_dlshts,"I [m/29] just recently dealt with some indiscretions via snapchat with my girlfriend [f/28], and I just found out more information regarding the ordeal, having already decided to forgive her, and now i'm so lost and don't know what to do.","So a couple of months ago, I found out my girlfriend had sent a few nudes to  a guy on snapchat. I immediately broke it off, and in the ensuing days, she sent me a couple of like novel length emails regarding like, figuring out what it was about her that made her able to do something like that.  I won't get into details about that, but I'm a pretty objective person, and I showed the emails to my sister and a couple of friends of both genders, and they were on the same page with me that she genuinely wants to be a better person, and is disgusted with what she was able to do. Due to the emails, and knowing her past and how it came into play, I decided to try to move past it, because I thought the long run would be worth it. There as some family stuff, and past relationship stuff that I factored in as well, and I really thought (think?) that she is a different person now.

We're in a long distance relationship, and it was also a factor to me because we hadn't gotten to the discussion about moving, and i told her if this was gonna continue she needed to move in a few month, which wasn't gonna be an easy thing to do, but she agreed, so i really thought highly of that as well. Basically that was a long winded way of saying that I genuinely have very little doubt about her ability and willingness to change.

Now the problem has come up where I found out that it wasn't just nudes, it was like, sexual conversations, videos, etc etc. As much as I like to think I would be a bigger person and br forthcoming about the fact that there were more than just nudes if I was in her situation, I think that I would have kept it to myself as well. Not in the least of which because I kind of made it very clear that had there been more, this would have been over with no discussion about. I regret saying that now because I dunno if she would have told me, but that's done now. Based on the emails she sent when we broke up, she was pretty devastated when it all happened, and was willing to basically do anything to make us work, so I'm trying not to factor in the fact that she didn't tell there was more, because I essentially told it would be a poison pill if i found out more, so I guess it's not that surprising that she didn't tell me.

Now the problem is that I don't know what to do. My gut instinct was to end it, and I did. this was a few hours ago. But I saw myself with this girl for the rest of my life, and we're amazing together and have so much in common, and she appreciates things about me that nobody ever has.  I know this all sounds pathetic given what happened in the beginning of our relationship, but it just had to be said. I do think those things I just mentioned are true, while also at the same time her not being able to control her urges. Not justifying, but just explaining, I guess. I'm also not blind to the fact that she did not respect me, or our relationship. She has basically said everything i could ever need her to say to make me feel like she's apologetic, devastated. sincere, etc etc etc.

As you can imagine, I'm also fucking devastated. I was devastated before when it was only nudes. Now knowing it was more, I'm 10x more crushed. I can't even explain the pain I'm in. But if I was willing to look past the nudes, is it worth it to look past like, a bit more, for the sake of the rest of my life? If I genuinely think she is a different person, and I was willing to take a chance on her, how much more is too much? Obviously anything physical is too much, and I'm not still sure about that yet, but I'm just hoping for the best right now. I really am on the fence about it. part of me knows she doesn't deserve it, and the disrespect she showed for our relationship should be unforgivable. But part of me knows that aside from this, and especially now, we are amazing. It doesn't help that I'm 29 and have been single for 10 years and haven't met anyone I really wanted to be with, and as sad as it is for me to say, my future is also on the line as well. I know that's a pathetic reason to even consider, but it's there, and I'm also writing this because I'm a bit pathetic, so I get it. But say I'm still single in 8 years, will I look back and think like, you could look past the nudes but the sexting was too much, and now look where you are...still single. If I thought she wasn't sincerely a different person, and wanting to change, I wouldn't be writing this. But I do think that, based on the pages and pages she wrote about the conversations she had with her friends and family about this, and why she was this way, and how she let it happen, and what has to change to make sure she never does this again, etc. It was just a lot.

I'm looking for an objective opinion on like, what I was able to forgive, given the circumstances, vs it being a bit more come to find out. I know most of you will even say dump them over the initial snapchat thing, I understand that, but please try to look past that, because given everything I've told you, I was able to forgive that. If you're able to ignore your gut response of ""dump her"" and just consider that I'm trying to figure out where my moral line is while also considering my life, and her ability to change, and weighing that against the fact that what i was initially able to forgive, has turned out to be slightly more, and whether or not that's something I can forgive....while also not being a doormat. Because I really don't know. Part of me says don't be a doormat, and part of me says people have come back from worse, and I can make it work and have a happy life with her.

It hurts so much writing this, but I hope to get some perspective. Especially if you've forgiven someone over maybe even more severe indiscretions, and it worked out for you.

Thanks

t3_dll25g,my friend's(21M) girlfriend (20F) cheated on him on his 21st birthday. And he doesn't see it as a big deal.,"Okay, so for context:

So he's been with his girlfriend for the past 4 months, and recently moved in with her (about a month ago). 

They seemed pretty happy, everybody was a fan of her, and i never really heard any complaints from him about her.

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast forward to last saturday. 

Our hometown isn't the best for nightlife, so he decided to come visit me for his 21st birthday night out,

as i live in a big city. His girlfriend decided not to come with him, and stayed at home.

We had a good night out on the saturday, celebrated well, and he went home in the morning on sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

When he got home, he'd found out that she had gone out drinking in our home town that night. He also felt that something was off with her.

He later found a condom wrapper on the stairs in their house, and asked her about it. She said that her and her friends were just messing about

blowing them up. He didn't see it as out of the ordinary so he just ignored it.

So later on that evening, she came in in tears and confessed to him that she had brought back another guy to their house and slept with him.

He called me and explained everything that happened, and told me that he was going to stay with her ""because she isn't good at hiding her emotions,

so if she was upset about it, she was being genuine"" (talking about her crying). He told me he wasn't as upset as he thought he would be, as he already

didn't trust her.

He says he's going to try work things out with her, as she was more upset than he was about it.

&amp;#x200B;

How can i convince him that what she did was wrong, and that she will be capable of doing it again if he just forgives her.

He's my best friend, and i don't want to come across as being pushy and invasive of his relationship, but it makes me sad to see her messing him around like this",relationship_advice

Everything started out normal when we started dating. After about 3 months, I noticed that he would not initiate and we were having sex less and less.  I finally addressed this after about a year of dating and let him know that I was not ok with this. He told me that he was just stressed about work (he was laid off at the time) but he would focus on making things right. More time passed, and nothing changed. We would only have sex once a year. I know I am partly responsible because I allowed the behavior to continue, but I was always promised that he would make things right and I did fall in love. It was hard for me to leave. The relationship was great other than this issue. We decided to get married despite my worries about his intimacy issues. He promised to go to therapy which we did for a year, and promised that he was dedicated to me and our life together. I felt we got nowhere with therapy.  More time came and went and I just got complacent with the situation.  By now we have gone 6 years without any sexual contact. Threats of divorce gave way to another round of therapy with a Sex Therapist. Again, we got nowhere.  By this time he is working more than ever running his own business, and now the business is stressing him out. More time passed. After begging for attention, crying myself to sleep for several years, and now being 7 years since we had sex......I cheated.  It was an affair that only lasted for a couple months. Husband found out by going through my text messages that I thought I deleted. I never denied the affair and confessed to everything. After all the tears, my husband said he felt ultimately responsible for the affair because he knew he didn‚Äôt hold up his promise to make things right with our sex life. He told me that he would make our relationship his number one priority and I promised him the same. Time is passing again and no changes. 
I‚Äôm at the point that I am considering divorce. I love him, but the desire to be intimate with him and being turned down or even embarrassed to ask for sex is devastating.

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about a year and I will start this off by admitting that I am the jealous type, not extreme, but I do know that certain things bother me that probably shouldn‚Äôt. Okay so the issue that I find myself in had to do with my girlfriend and another guy who I‚Äôll call Andrew. My girlfriend, Andrew, and myself all work at the same company (it‚Äôs actually how I met my girlfriend) and for as long as I‚Äôve known my girlfriend she‚Äôs never expressed any interest in Andrew in any way, they weren‚Äôt even work friends as of a month ago. However, about a week ago I noticed my girlfriend was texting one person A LOT. Like constant texting at least hundreds of messages daily and although it bothered me I know I can be a bit jealous so I let it go for about a week and when it wasn‚Äôt stopping I finally asked about it and who it was. She told me it was Andrew and that she reached out to him because he‚Äôs going through some personal issues she heard about and wanted to offer support and apparently Andrew said he needed the support and that‚Äôs why she had been talking to him so much. I accepted this and let it go. The next day i was heading to lunch and I noticed my girlfriend and Andrew were alone eating lunch together. This made me uncomfortable so I told my girlfriend and asked that if that was to happen again could she please tell me so that I don‚Äôt just walk in on that because it really made me uncomfortable and she basically said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and that was the end of that. For the next few days I noticed they were still always texting and he would call but she‚Äôd never answer it around me (I‚Äôm not sure if she does when I‚Äôm not around) but I didn‚Äôt say anything. However tonight I was working the night shift and Andrew and my girlfriend both had the day off. I was walking out to my car because I left some work papers in their and I happened to see my girlfriend and Andrew both sitting in his car parked in the back of the lot. I had no idea she was even near work and she definitely didn‚Äôt tell me she was with Andrew. She saw me and gave a little wave and I walked over and just said ‚ÄúI had no idea you were here‚Äù and then told her we needed to talk. She came in and found me to talk (about 15 minutes later so obviously she finished talking to Andrew) and I told her that I was hurt she wouldn‚Äôt tell me and I don‚Äôt like them doing something like that. I didn‚Äôt get an apology but she said she was hurt that I wouldn‚Äôt trust her and I have nothing to worry about so I told her I‚Äôm not accusing you of cheating I‚Äôm just saying what you‚Äôre doing makes me uncomfortable and I‚Äôm pretty sure Andrew knows what he‚Äôs doing because that‚Äôs not normal behavior with someone who you know is in a relationship. She left and went home and I‚Äôm torn because I would never think she would ever cheat on me but you know the saying ‚Äúif it walks like a duck and talks like a duck....‚Äù I also have noticed that she never answers my FaceTime calls when she‚Äôs home now and this is pure speculation but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs already talking to Andrew.

t3_dlpg9r,[29/F] My Boyfriend (27/M) Mom is Dying and He's Pushing Me Away and Making Bad Choices,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, but really only together for 1 as his job requires him to travel and he will be back for about 2 months and gone for another 2. We have lived together about half the time but I did get my own apartment in the Seattle where I work as I5 is a nightmare. He owns a home in Tacoma about a 45 minute drive away. However this is very serious, long term committed relationship with each other, and we see other as much as possible when he is home and not away for work.

About a year ago his Mom got diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. I am very close to her, and his family, including spending time with each of them even when he's away for work. We have also done family vacations, and this has been hard on all of us including me. She is getting very close to the end now, and he has started up some behaviors that were problems in the relationship before but had stopped for about half a year now. The first time is he hid behaviors from me when was around when we first started dating a year and a half ago. I found out that he does like a bi-annual or more ""Fear and Loathing"" type drug escapade with a good friend of his from work where they get basically ""anything they can get their hands on"" as far as drugs, and go to random cities and just burn it down. 

I first found out about it from looking at his phone, he didn't tell me. This first time it was not snooping just was on his phone looking up a restaurant, as mine was dead and the texts came through while he was using the bathroom. I casually asked about when he came out, and didn't think much of it at first as he has a good job, owns a home, has his finances in order. He just told me he was embarrassed, and that's why he never brought it up to me.

But as things got more serious with us, he was planning another trip and this time just outright confessed it to me, saying he didn't want to engage in this any more. I told him I agreed, and it wasn't healthy or productive. He said he would stop and tell his friend he did this with that he was done, but that he would like to still be friends with that person. He said he wanted me and his friend to meet and for them to have a low key weekend together, and just go out to dinner/have beers/catch up. Normal stuff.

Well, we went out to dinner and I knew something was up. His friend was acting sketchy and making excuses about how he really needed to leave dinner and ""borrow"" my boyfriend's car at dinner. When I asked my boyfriend about this, he made excuses. So, again but this time purposely, I looked at his phone. The first tab that was open was ""How to delete text messages on Iphone."" Then some texts on deleted threads about them obviously communicating with a drug dealer. 

So he had lied to me about it, and was planning on doing it behind my back. We had a big fight about it and he just seemed to fail to realize it was less about the drugs themselves, just that he was lying and sneaking around to me. He promised he would stop and begged for another chance to try to be honest. I gave it to him. We made plans for dinner the next night and he no showed. I called him and he sounded ""out of it"" and that ""he didn't realize what time it was and was sorry."" So, assuming he was on drugs, I drove to his house like a crazy person and parked down the street. I came in the house and found pills/powder/beers all over the coffee table and him and friend passed out in the living room at 6 pm. I lost it, he promised he'd stop, begged me to give him one more chance. I agreed, because I loved him and he promised he'd get therapy or try to work on himself and why he feels the need to do this and lie about it. He says he's had problems lying his whole life and wanted to find out why he can't just be honest with those close to him. He got called back to work three weeks later and never started therapy.

Fast forward to a few months later and things are going well in general, other than his mother getting progressively worse. He powered off his phone and left it by the front door after a date night though last weekend, which I knew was odd because he always sleeps it with on the charger next to him when we go to bed. I was still up and watching a movie so I thought, I am just going to see what is going on. I powered up his phone and all these texts came through on deleted threads. He'd been actively planning another trip with said friend, where they were just going to go to Portland next weekend and find a drug dealer and piss themselves away on ""whatever they can get their hands on.""  (There was also a text message from his ex-girlfriend where he had  asked her out for a beer the night before, and she responded at 12:30 am.) 

Obviously I lost it and threw him out. He didn't even try to defend it this time. His Mom is literally days away from dying and he's acting like this. Jeopardizing not only a loving and long term relationship with me, but his own health and safety. The next day I went to his place to pick up a few of my things and we talked again and because I was chalking this up to him grieving and acting out, and was still open to giving him a chance to work on this and not engage in this behavior.

He however was not, saying he needs to decide what he wants, a relationship or if he just wants to be alone. He says he's not sure if he wants kids, and doesn't want to lead me on but he knows he will be lonely without me. I told him fear of being lonely is not a good enough reason to stay in a relationship. He then said that he wants to travel the world (so do I?) This statement is all so wild because yes, I do want kids, but have NEVER pressured him about this, and will not have kids out of wed-lock. I see that as a conversation to be had if we get engaged, which I am also in no hurry for, and maybe 2-3 years down the road. (I am in no place nor desire children right now, actively focused on my career.)

I think he's just going besides himself with grief and making a lot of bad decisions and making up weird excuses in this ""grief fog"" but also, he's done this behavior before, and don't want to make excuses for him. Also for context, I've been very supportive influence in his life, pushing him to better himself and put himself out there in his career and he has. I encouraged networking events and he's been promoted and is so much more confident then when we first met. I'm close to his family and also have their support in this and they don't condone his behavior and are planning on ""talking with him"" and told me ""to take care of me"". I'm attractive, driven, and have a great career so will not have trouble moving on, and all my friends say I should and don't understand why I even gave him another chance previously. They says I can do so much better, but I genuinely love and care for him and who he is. I am not sure what do here. 

Do I move on, or should I give him patience and support and understand he is just acting out and not behaving rationally at this time? I cannot be okay with him going on this drug binge and wonder if him just breaking things off is his way of doing this. Any thoughts, insights, advice is appreciated on how to handle this.

TL;DR: Serious long-term boyfriend's Mom is days away from dying of cancer. Now he wants to do a bunch of drugs, and is reaching out ex-girlfriends and pushing me away. Help.",relationship_advice

t3_dlgsva,"A guy (M19) that I‚Äôm with told me (F19) that I look like lil tecca - an ugly rapper, and I don‚Äôt know how to react.","

Okay so for context I‚Äôm a 19 year old black girl. For the better part of my younger teenage years, I would spend a lot of time on reddit/4chan and other edgy internet places; it goes without saying that these places are not kind to black women(or women in general). And though i know a lot of it just jokes i was pretty impacted by the significant amount of men that just weren‚Äôt attracted to black women because of what they had experienced. They would stereotype and berate their looks and appearances a lot; this depressed me. Couple that with the fact that during this time, a lot of guys that I was friends with (and even ones I didn‚Äôt know and wasn‚Äôt interested in) would feel the need to tell me that they didn‚Äôt like black women; swell. I hated my skin at this point and wanted to be white so badly. 
Fast forward to 2018 and 2019 when now it‚Äôs  essentially cool to be black. Of course, guys are now a little mature and for the first time in my life I‚Äôm starting to question how ugly I really am, as attractive men are starting to be interested in me. (Of course on reddit I‚Äôm still a 5/10 tho). I‚Äôm starting to feel more confident but still have issues with self image and hold myself back from pursuing the men I want because I‚Äôm scared they won‚Äôt like black women or find black skin ugly. 
But as of like two months ago I met a guy. He‚Äôs white hispanic but exclusively like ethnic (mostly black) women. We click; but not just because we find each other attractive but our personalities are compatible. He tells me I‚Äôm cute and praises my looks and shushes any attempts at me to deny his praise. I gas him up just as much because I get that men need that type of stuff because unfortunately they don‚Äôt get it enough. 
Yesterday we were talking, and he told me I look like lil tecca, a 16 year old rapper. The reason why this kid is a meme is unfortunately because he‚Äôs [‚Äúugly‚Äù](https://imgur.com/a/xBorBKd)
This guy that I‚Äôve been talking to just went on and on about how I look like him and he found it VERY funny. Like he just kept on laughing and laughing and saying that it was uncanny. I was wondering if it was a joke the whole time, because he‚Äôs a very very sensitive anxious conscious guy and this seemed left field for him; but he wasn‚Äôt kidding and he meant it. Honest to god that shit hurt to hear; especially coming from this guy that I‚Äôm REALLY into. Like I know he finds me attractive and everything, but hearing this really made me question that and feel really insecure. I didn‚Äôt tell him this, but I‚Äôm sure he got the sense that I wasn‚Äôt really into his ‚Äújoke‚Äù because he started to back track and say ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt look THAT much like him‚Äù 

I told my best friend (who is his best friend too) about this and he lost it too, so I‚Äôm starting to fucking thing, do I look like him? I‚Äôm so confused right now and kinda sad and hurt. I don‚Äôt want to be that emotional bitch, but really I feel bad about this. I know that both of these guys find me attractive so there‚Äôs a lot of cognitive dissonance going on right now. 

Should I brush it off and pretend that it‚Äôs a funny joke and not let him  know I was hurt by it? Or should I confront him?
Should I grow a thicker skin? 


For the record; as I am  very sensitive  I am also conscious and empathetic. I would NEVER tell someone that they looked like an ugly celebrity to their face even if we were close. Mostly because I wouldn‚Äôt want someone to do that to me. I know the detrimental effects little comments have on self esteem and worth. 

Also because I KNOW everyone wants to see me, here: 

https://imgur.com/a/3pvzqjj


TLDR: a guy that I‚Äôm pretty much dating told me I look like little tecca and wouldn‚Äôt stop denying it/laughing about it. I‚Äôm sad, because little tecca is ugly as shit, and I‚Äôm insecure about being black and in attractive. Should I express my feelings to the guy about how his joke made me feel bad, even though I KNOW for a fact he finds me beautiful?

I have a different idea of how my body looks and then if I see a picture of myself, I‚Äôm surprised that that‚Äôs how I really look. It‚Äôs weird. So I know that‚Äôs why I have this issue but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get over it. 

I like having sex in dim light or the dark. No lights on, one candle by the bed is ideal. And I like being under the covers. That‚Äôs pretty much my only ‚Äúquirk‚Äù my boyfriend was fine with it and respected it and never complained. And we can see enough with the candle light, it‚Äôs perfect in my opinion. It‚Äôs sexy and romantic and kind of shadowy which is good since honestly genitals aren‚Äôt very aesthetically pleasing so the low light helps blur things and it‚Äôs easier to look at lol. I also say that I don‚Äôt want him to look at me while I give him a blow job. I will sometimes look up at him to make sure but I want him to be looking up or somewhere else. Honestly I just feel awkward and ugly and gross and I try to do a good job and I don‚Äôt wanna be worried about how I look, I just wanna focus on my task so I‚Äôd rather he doesn‚Äôt look at me while I don‚Äôt look pretty. I think it‚Äôs a reasonable request like I don‚Äôt want him to see me choking on him and having drool all over and my face looking dumb. 

Last night I was ‚Äúservicing‚Äù him and I looked up and he was looking at me. So I stopped and told him that I told him not to look at me when I‚Äôm doing that. He was annoyed and said I was being dramatic and that I look fine. He just wasn‚Äôt understanding. It got me frustrated so we kind of argued. 

I don‚Äôt like fighting with my boyfriend but that‚Äôs what happened. He‚Äôs still mad at me today. I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs gonna break up with me and I don‚Äôt want him to. So can someone just tell me if I‚Äôm insane and making crazy demands? I don‚Äôt think so, I think he should have respected my wishes while I was doing that for him.

t3_dlp8uo,My boss (28M) said something that makes it clear he respects our brand new (21M) employee over me (29F),"I've been working at this company for about 8 months. I was hired into a position that was directly relevant to my experience and education, and I've been doing a good job, my boss tells me that often. 


We just hired a new guy to help out on our team. I think he's smart and a pretty good worker, I have no issues with him at all. He was given the same job title as me despite never working before/an unrelated education but whatever, again, I didn't really care.

We have another girl on our team who does administrative functions and to be honest, she is very bad at it. My boss gave up completely on managing her because she is tough to work with, and passed it on to me as a clear test to see if I'm deserving of a promotion, which he told me he will help me work towards.


Anyway, today, it became clear that she still sucks at her job despite my best attempts at managing her. He understands that it's just how difficult she is to work with and said it doesn't reflect on my efforts, and he was saying she may just need to go. He said we might not need her anymore because the new guy can take on the work that I'm doing, and I could take on all of her administrative work, and only keep a tiny bit of what I'm doing.

I said I like what I'm doing, and that the administrative stuff didn't particularly interest me, and he said ""oh yeah we can figure something out."" I messaged him later, proposing a way of splitting up some of her tasks between me and the new guy, and he responded **""I think we need to use new guys brain more, not sure I see the value in him doing that or that its the best for him.""**


So I guess he sees the value in me doing all the admin stuff then? Like I don't want to act like I am above it but I've worked 8 years to get to where I am in my career and it was absolutely not in my job description to do any of that. I'm always happy to help out short term, but it seems like he is now only seeing me as a glorified admin.


Meanwhile, new guy is doing pretty good for someone brand new on the job but my boss doesn't see how much I am working directly with new guy to walk him through things, answer questions, provide guidance, etc. 


To be honest, it feels sexist that he would say that. I know that I am great at my job, everyone tells me, including my boss, so why else would he say a brand new guys brain is better suited for the more challenging work that I'm doing, that my boss knows that I like, and that I'm excelling at.


I'm so upset about this that I don't know how to address it. If he only wants me to do admin stuff then I will quit, I took a leave of absense from my old job and have no problem going back there, I loved this job except for my bosses anger issues (the whole team gets it) and now this.

t3_dl66x5,I (29f) never thought I'd be right where I am today. I need some kind words,"Throwaway because I know my ex-husband and his wife are both on reddit. not sure about this sub but wanted to be safe.

A little backstory: My husband and I divorced 3+ years ago. He left me for another woman, whom he married very shortly after our divorce was finalized.

I'm the first to admit that our marriage was over long before she came around but I can't help but hate her. We were married young. I was 18 and he was 19. He was in the military. Once he got out, I think we were both different people who had grown apart. Suffice it to say, I got pregnant with our first child in 2013 and our second in 2015. We fought constantly, I demanded that he sleep in the guest room. He was always working supporting our family and looking back, I took him foregranted. He did his best to support us and I didn't treat him like the husband he deserved to be. We were essentially roommates raising two kids and the environment we were raising them in was pretty volatile. Even if we did try counseling, I'm not it would have helped.

Since he abruptly left, he has been an active part of their lives. He never missed a child support payment and sees them per the terms of our custody agreement, which is every other weekend and alternating holidays. He also gets them for several weeks each summer.

The kids love their time at their dads and love their step mom as well. They talk about their time there very positively and I'm happy for that. I'm happy that they have a warm environment, a ton of toys, cute clothes, opportunities to see the world, all with 2 people who seem to genuinely prioritize their marriage and love one another.

What I struggle with is I feel like I've been robbed. I look at their life and compare it to my own. I see a woman who my husband left me for. She's tall, beautiful, has the best clothes, has a successful career and loves my kids. It seems like the two of them have the happy, positive relationship I yearned for with my husband at the time. I'm jealous and I'm angry. For christ sake, even their 2 dogs are adorable and perfect

More so than that, I've struggled since he left to provide financially and I can't take them on fancy vacations and all of the things my ex and his new wife are able to do.  I only have 1 income and it's modest. Both of their careers have taken off in the past few years and seem to be doing well for themselves.

Every time I pull up to drop off the kids, I see their massive, beautiful home (I've been inside and it's immaculate). They both drive new bmws. They go on 3 or 4 vacations a year that are anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks (sometimes the kids come, sometimes they don't). Every time, it's inevitable for me to see pictures of them and the kids in Europe, South America, the Caribbean, and wherever else. It hurts because I feel like the woman in those pictures should be me. I hate this woman with every fiber of my being for taking my husband away from me but at the same time, respect her for welcoming 2 my babies into her life and treating them as her own. I still want to stab her though.

Very recently, after picking up my kids from a weekend at dads, they were so excited to tell me that their step mom is pregnant with twins and they were going to have not one, but two new brothers or sisters. I felt like I was just punched in the stomach. All of the feelings I experienced when my ex-husband left the first time came back. The flood gates opened and once I got home, I bawled my eyes out.

It's been 3 years since we split up. I should be over this. I shouldn't have these feelings but just don't know how to stop feeling the way I do. I wish therapy was an option but I just can't afford, even with insurance. My family listens but I know I'm probably a broken record at this point. Also, I have no one to blame but myself for letting my marriage spin out of control like it did. How do you rectify that? Any kind words or advice would be appreciated.

 **FOLLOW UP:** Wow. I wasn't expecting such a huge response to this post. Thank you everyone for your comments--good, back and ugly. The internet can serve as a reality check sometimes. Having complete strangers say some things that I needed to hear is cathartic. It's different when it comes from unbiased strangers. So, thank you, kind and not-so kind people.

Everyone is right. The choices I made with my ex husband are in the past. What I need to move past and find for myself what he has. I hate how the two of them got together. Just to clarify, he DID have an affair with her. It lasted about a month before she gave him an ultimatum. Me or her. He chose her. Take it for what it's worth, he isn't a one night stand kind of guy. They were colleagues who worked in different firms, struck up a friendship that ultimately led them where they are today. I believe him that it wasn't something that went on for months. In fact, I met her once months before their affair. It was at an industry function that I attended with my husband at the time. He introduced me to her and I remember thinking she was radiant, funny and personable. The two of them interacted very little that night. She was with her date who I'm not sure if she was dating but nonetheless, she was someone I even thought I could be friends with. Boy, how wrong was I? That was nearly 5 years ago. In my state, you have to be legally separated for 1 year before a divorce can be finalized. The whole thing did a number on my self esteem, identity and position in life. What compounded all of this is I see them constantly. Especially her. My ex commutes about an hour to and from work and she works right around the corner from her house. So, it's always her there on Friday afternoon when I drop off the kids. Every Friday it's the same. She opens the door and has perfect hair, a cute outfit and high heels that probably cost me a months rent. If I'm being honest, though, they're perfect for each other. The way my kids talk about how daddy treats \[step mom\] and \[step mom\] treats daddy make me happy that they see such a strong marriage and good example of how two people should love and respect each other within a marriage.

Some of my friends are friends with some of their friends and I've been put in my place when venting about them. One of my best friends who often says the things I don't want to hear told me, ""you know, you aren't her. you didn't meet your husband when you were 28 and had things figured out and knew who you were and what you wanted. you learned and are at where you are now because of trial and unfortunately, error.""

I believe I do a good job at shielding my kids from these emotions. They don't hear me speak ill of either my ex-husband or their step mom. From what I understand, the two of them reciprocate that respect. We have a simple life and despite pretty much always being in 2 households (my oldest wasn't even 2 when my ex left), they are pretty well adjusted.

All in all, today serves as my first day in truly trying to compartmentalize and move on from the mistakes of my past. I'm taking some of your advice and am going to seek out affordable therapists who perhaps operate on a sliding scale. It'll be hard and not without it's fair share of recurring feelings, but I feel empowered after reading all the things you all wrote. It's to get back on the proverbial horse and build the life I want rather than rue in the life I lost.

So about a week after we first started seeing each other, she confessed that she was still in contact with this guy that she used to have a pretty big thing for.

During this discussion she also explained that they had never actually dated, she was just into him. They remained friends and her crush on him fizzled out. 

Fast forward to today, her and I had just woken up from a nap and we were just chatting and lazing out in bed, she was going through her snapchat memories. All of the sudden a picture of her and him pops up...and then another, and another. Maybe 8 in total. In all of them they were getting pretty close with each other, as in not typically the kind of close you get with someone who is ""just a friend"". Obviously they were old pictures, but I went ahead and asked her about it anyway. ""I thought you and X never dated?"" to which she replied ""yeah we never OFFICIALLY dated"", She got pretty nervous at me asking too... At this point a little red flag went up. To me they obviously were more than just friends, and the fact that she was seemingly trying to downplay the nature of their relationship while maintaining contact with him raises an eyebrow for sure.

I (30 M) have been with my wife (31 F) for five years now. I knew that when I got with my wife, she had a very traumatic childhood and bad family relationships. I have also had a traumatic childhood and do not have relationships with my immediate family members. We definitely bonded over this shared pain when we first got together.

I have some concerns about our relationship which has been tumultuous to say the least that have come to a head. 

She has been sick our whole relationship. I don‚Äôt know at this point if it is real or not. I want to believe her, but there are certain things that make me doubt her. At first she was sick with a chronic auto-immune disease. Then that morphed into other auto-immune diseases. She did see a doctor for these, but when the doctor would not prescribe her pain killers she usually got so upset felt that she wasn‚Äôt being believed and never went back. I do know that patients with ‚Äúinvisible illnesses‚Äù are often treated like they are drug seeking by doctors and are disregarded.

Because of her illness, she hasn‚Äôt had a job for the majority of our relationship. I have been the sole provider, working 2-3 jobs to support us. She refuses to apply for disability support, as she was denied on the basis of her physical illness. She also has a long documented history of mental illness, which she would qualify for, but she still refuses to apply. I‚Äôve suggested she find a way to work from home, even part time, even for minimum wage as it would help tremendously. She has made no effort in this regard either. Usually when I bring it up, she gets very upset and ends the conversation.

She does the majority of the housework and requires constant recognition and praise for what she does. I‚Äôm sure that not working affects her self esteem and I do my best to constantly thank and praise her. I appreciate this about her, but I am not so observant after working 60-90 hours a week and often fail to thank her. This tends to start fights, and I feel resentful of having to constantly thank her when I work myself to the bone and never expect a thank you back.

When we first got together, she didn‚Äôt have any interests in my friend group. I tried to introduce her to them. She either criticized them, got jealous, or pushed me to abandon my friendships. She avoids spending any time with my family that I do have. She is often suddenly not feeling well enough to see them when they do visit, leaving me to either cancel or awkwardly cover for her. As a result of my complicity, I don‚Äôt have many friends left. The few I do have, I speak to in secret as she is often very jealous of them and gets upset when I spend any time with them. 

She and I get into fights often. My tone seems to upset her a lot and is usually a reason for the argument to begin with. I often don‚Äôt mean anything by my tone. I‚Äôm just generally burnt out and tired so I can sound short without meaning it. When we get into fights she often tells me I‚Äôm abusive and threatens to leave me. I know I have a unsecured attachment style from my childhood abuse and it triggers me to hear things like this. I have been in therapy for over three years to address this, but I feel the tumultuous nature of our relationship gets in the way of progress I‚Äôm trying to make.  

I have been someone I don‚Äôt often like in our relationship. I have had bad relationships before her, and I‚Äôve never fought this much with anyone. I often just take all the blame for any fights we have and apologize for things that aren‚Äôt my fault just to keep the peace. This has caused me to become resentful and bitter. I know this is my own doing, but I feel lost on how to deal with it in any other way. She is able to stay mad at me for weeks, unless I take full ownership of any problem and apologize over and over. If I bring up something that she has done that hurts me, she is either annoyed that my feelings are hurt or disregards them completely because of something I have done that negates my feelings entirely. I almost never feel heard or validated. 

I have tried different styles of dealing with her, but that usually requires me to always be calm, clear with my boundaries, and non-reactive to whatever she throws at me. I can‚Äôt always do this, even when I try my best. 

Our love life has been non-existent for a while. She often rejects any affection I try and show her, so I have stopped trying.

I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I don‚Äôt have a support network, other than my therapist. I feel too guilty leaving her, because I am the one with a job and a way to make money. She doesn‚Äôt have family to lean on and often says she would go to a shelter if we broke up. The idea of that makes me feel awful. I don‚Äôt want to abandon my sick wife who I do love, despite all of this. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is a bit scattered. I haven‚Äôt really opened up about all of this before and I‚Äôm trying to articulate what is wrong the best I can. I just feel like I‚Äôm constantly swimming against the current and drowning and I don‚Äôt know what I should do.  Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqofw,My (28m) gf (27f) wanted a break. What should I do?,"I've been with my gf the last 3 years. We've talked about marriage, and starting a family in a couple of years.  

Today she told me that she has changed in the last 3 years, and that she didn't know what she really wants right now. She says she loves me but she is not sure if as a couple or only as a friend.  

We agreed to take a two weeks break and to meet  then to talk about the future, and to discuss what being a couple really means to each one of us. Both of us can send only one message to the other in that time, and that message will not be replied.  

I really love her, and I want to be with her. My plan is radio silence this 2 weeks, and use this time to ponder how I've changed the last 3 years, and how can we continue to change (as is natural to everyone) in the future, but together.  

Any advice? Anything else I should do or think in this time?  

Thanks!

t3_dlsplb,"Am I right to be annoyed that my girlfriend (of well over two years) didn't invite me ,as a plus one, to her friend's wedding?","So me and my girlfreind have been dating for over 2 years and 6 months. We've lived together for over a year.

For further context, she is not from of my country (where we live), so quite a bit of money has been spent in order to obtain a visa for her to stay here.

To the question at hand; her friend recently had a 'destination' wedding - which is actually closer to my country than to the happy couple's. My girlfriend went alone to the wedding, not even asking if I would like to come. Maybe I'm just being entitled, but it's not like we've been dating for two months or something. We've been dating quite a long time, living together, and I've paid quite a bit of money in order for her to stay here.

I mean, fair enough if this was just a small wedding with few close friends and family, but from pictures I saw, there were babies, toddlers, and all sorts.

I feel like to a certain extent she's embarrassed by me, and my inability to speak her, and her friends, native language.

t3_dlsohq,"My (30f) long-simmering anger towards my close friend‚Äôs (28f) husband (31m) boiled over before I had time to address it in a calmer manner. It, uh... didn‚Äôt go well. What do I do? What do I even want?","Warning: long-ass post. 

I‚Äôve written a version of this a million times. I have known for a few years it wasn‚Äôt going to end well, but I didn‚Äôt imagine it would go this way. I‚Äôve tried to shorten this as much as I could, but a long story is a long story. Throwaway because everyone involved reddits so let‚Äôs throw the dice.

I met Carrie (28f) in college and we became part of a close friend group. She met her now-husband David (31m) two years later, and we all became easy friends. Years and states and lots of road trips have gone by for all of us.

There‚Äôs a lot of backstory I could give but I‚Äôll try to simplify it as much as possible. David has changed over the past ten years. He always had some mental health issues (as many of our group do), but now he uses them like a weapon. Temper tantrums and sniping, overwhelming negativity and ranting and spiraling over the slightest disappointment. Rudeness and total obliviousness to others‚Äô feelings or circumstances. 

It‚Äôs not like I have no sympathy as I suffer from mental health issues too, but he has had so many opportunities to get help, so much support, and he refuses to utilize any of it, and instead projects his unhappiness until everyone else is miserable too. I have felt uneasy for awhile about Carrie and David‚Äôs relationship because sometimes they treat each other with such casual cruelty, but other than being there for her when she is hurt I‚Äôve tried to let their marriage be their business.

I‚Äôve been becoming more and more fed up with his behavior lately, especially since I recently introduced Carrie and David to my oldest and dearest friends, Diane (31f) and Matt (32m). They love Carrie, but don‚Äôt appreciate David‚Äôs attitude towards themselves or his own wife. He‚Äôs become so intolerably childish and rude and selfish that I get stomach aches at the thought of having to be around him from secondhand embarrassment. I‚Äôve been trying to think of how to approach it without losing Carrie.

There‚Äôs some additional backstory here. Two months ago, my best friend of 20 years‚Äô mother, Diane‚Äôs mom, a second mother to me, committed suicide in a particularly horrific way. The suicide is awful enough, but the way she did it and what she said is what tears me apart. I‚Äôve definitely been more emotional and quicker to anger since it happened, though I‚Äôm okay most of the time. 

Since then, I find I can no longer tolerate him. Partially due to his behavior after I told him about it. But fair or not, I cannot stand the sight of him or endure the emotional burden of his behavior and the responsibility of making Carrie feel better. I‚Äôve realized that I actually view his behavior as emotionally abusive, and that I didn‚Äôt view it as such before because he is not the typical aggressive abuser. He is manipulative through his sadness and his tantrums and passive aggressiveness. 

Carrie is responsible for maintaining his friendships (her friendships, really) and mending fences when he‚Äôs crossed a line. She‚Äôs not allowed to see her friends (me and others) by herself unless he‚Äôs out of town, because he‚Äôll make sure she knows that she is responsible for him feeling terrible and left out, because he won‚Äôt put any effort into creating and maintaining friendships himself. He won‚Äôt put any effort at all into even pretending to interact with her parents, even though they‚Äôve been nothing but welcoming and Carrie has told him over and over how important it is that he at least pretends to enjoy interacting with them occasionally (I‚Äôve witnessed this, so it‚Äôs not just Carrie bitching).

She‚Äôll make emotional bids and try to involve him in things that make her happy or that she is excited about, and he‚Äôll just keep staring at his phone and say something noncommittal or even outright negative, and she deflates. I know that he uses the silent treatment to punish her. I know that he flies into a whiny rage when she doesn‚Äôt read his mind.

On top of that, I don‚Äôt know the details but something is fishy financially. She talks about her independence being the reason they don‚Äôt have a joint account, but she asks him for permission to spend money and I know that a savings account exists that they both contribute to, and if it‚Äôs not in both their names...

But I am not entirely altruistic. I hate the way he treats her, but I also hate being around him. So I resolved to write Carrie a letter trying to explain things in a more levelheaded way than I actually felt, and perhaps give room for a tiny friendship again one day, even if I could no longer be around her husband.

I wrote a few drafts of the letter. They were all pretty angry and I was trying to tone it down because Diane is not responsible for his behavior and shouldn‚Äôt have to bear the burden of the shame he doesn‚Äôt seem to feel. She isn‚Äôt his mother. I had reached a pretty good draft two weeks ago, but before I could refine it and send it out... 

I can‚Äôt help but selfishly plead my case that on top of Diane‚Äôs mother‚Äôs suicide, I have also been dealing with some really stressful and scary health issues and financial issues over the last two months, as well as a non-stop two weeks of disasters at work. 

Carrie knew all of this when, two weeks ago, we‚Äôd been talking on the phone for about twenty minutes while I talked about how awful things had been, especially that day, and she said, verbatim, ‚Äúnot to make your shitty night even shittier...‚Äù and said David thought I‚Äôd been avoiding him lately and they wanted to know what was going on. I was annoyed she had to do his dirty work again. I didn‚Äôt want to lie to her ‚Äúface.‚Äù I was angry and stressed and already ranting, and I did exactly what I was afraid I would do and the very reason I started writing that letter... I ranted at her about everything awful about him. I don‚Äôt even remember all of it, but I know Carrie was in tears by the end of it and that we haven‚Äôt talked since. I‚Äôve split apart our gaming group and I‚Äôve probably lost three friends in a single night.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt deserve it. I didn‚Äôt blame Carrie for David‚Äôs behavior, and that, at least, I can say for certainty I said more than once during my rant. But it was angrier and crueler than it needed to be. I‚Äôm sad. But mostly I feel relieved.

I know I should reach out, it‚Äôs ten years of friendship... but I find myself not wanting to? I‚Äôm tired right now. I‚Äôm so, so tired. I don‚Äôt want to take care of her feelings and I don‚Äôt even want to take care of my own. I don‚Äôt feel sorry for what I said, only the way I said it. I don‚Äôt want to bend over backwards to ‚Äúmake things right.‚Äù But I know I‚Äôll regret this in the future. I feel like maybe this is my last and only chance to tell her that I think he‚Äôs emotionally abusive. I have so many feelings and none of them are sorted out, other than the relief. 

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before? What do I do here?

Maybe this is more ranting than anything but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Some people have said to meet her in person but I know she‚Äôll cry and I‚Äôll want to cave and make things better but I desperately don‚Äôt want to. My life is better without him and I would‚Äôve done it years ago if not for Carrie. Maybe I just have to say goodbye but I don‚Äôt want that either. 

Is losing friendships just part of getting older?

I would not normally think this would be something to warrant concern however last week he went out and spent almost a thousand dollars on clown costumes. He now comes home from work and dresses either as pogo the clown or patches the clown and stays in the clown costumes all night.

t3_dlkcu6,"I'm gonna pull the trigger tonight and I need everyone's opinion, me(21M) and my girlfriend (20F)"," 

Sorry for the long text in advance. I think details were needed to try and give all side of the story.

So my entire life I never really had a relationship it was more of hooking up with girls and just letting my lust take over and frankly I was completely fine with that. In the middle of the year I transfer to go to a different college and I went on tinder to do my thing and I met a chick who I found really amusing and she came over that night( I was just expecting the regular Netflix and chill) but she stop me and said she wanted to get to know me more because she was fond of me and didn't wanna mess that up. I thought about it and I agreed and we just watch a movie,made jokes and cuddle and for the first time ever in my life something felt like it was pouring out like there was an emotion that I had been neglecting this entire time. However, I always think logical and I knew it was the endorphins and dopamine flowing through me essentially ""love"" but I liked it so for the first time in my life I gave this girl a chance. 3 to 4 weeks go by and she's practically over at my house every other day we have dates and we're making it work and that 4th week she ask me if we can be together and that she's crazy about me and has never felt like this about anyone before and I go ahead and agreed and we start going on but the logical side of my mind had been catching patterns that she was aware of that I was observing for example her phone was on do not disturb all the time, she was constantly looking at her apple watch and depending what she looked at her phone would affect her mood.

Being the curious human being that I am I have her come over on the same week we started dating I wait for her to fall asleep and I go through her phone and I find out that she's still talking to guys she met on tinder or had a thing with some conversations where plain but others more complex like the next day she left my house after we became a thing she texted a guy and wanted to know where she stand with him because she made her really happy and she was getting mixed signals but my friends the story doesn't end there I keep quiet and I keep monitoring the conversation for about 2 weeks building enough evidence to break up with her. The cherry on top is that I fell asleep early one night and she texted a guy who she had a thing asking what was he up to because she went over to ""friends"" house and he fell asleep early so now she's bored and then I found another one and she was talking to a guy and how the guy was saying that he enjoys hanging out with her and having her over and that it sucks that she's always ""busy"". So at this point I build my report she leaves my house the next day and then I called her that night telling to explain the story and I get put on voicemail right away and I thought it was odd so I called again and she picks up with a dry tone ""hey I'm doing hw I'll call you when I'm done beep.."" I couldn't even get an ok out through my end because she hung up fast so I go on snapchat and check her location and she's not home so at this point I'm pretty piss off, I get a call from her 2 hours later saying ""hey baby what's up sorry I was busy but now I can talk to you"" then i proceed to tell her everything i know and tell her it's over and she explodes she starts screaming and crying says that she doesn't know what I'm talking about then she start threatening to kill herself so i decided to have her come over. I was truly a gentleman never made malicious comments and kept it civil so she could talk and I could hear her out.

She tells me that some of the guys are truly friends and the other ones she did have something on the pass with them but nothing has ever happened when we started talking or going out but regardless I let her know how she greeted me with a dry tone and how this wasn't her behavior and she try to explain to me that she was talking a friend out of committing suicide and that's why she was upset but I found a loop on her story and made her explain to me the situation one more time it the loop was that she was upset when she was talking to him but the order that she explained it was I called her first and then her friend called her explaining his situation so I stated the mistake in her story and how she was lying and she started crying again and we talked some more so I gave her an ultimatum on 3 conditions 1. If I find out she was lying to me about this or I found out anything from here on out we would be done 2. Things wouldn't be the same right away and that my trust was broken so it was gonna take time to heal 3. I needed some space to clear my mind(5 days was the total) she agreed and we cuddle and went to sleep and I thought that I made the right choice but deep down I knew that this wasn't over because the tea was just simmering.

 

So now that we're half way caught up after the whole scenario we have a week without seeing each other just to give some space and relax but ofcourse we talk on the phone and message each other and she tells me how much she loves me and that she wishes that she could see me soon. Next week comes by and I reflected and thought about and it and I really wanted to settled down and try to make it work so I did just that I tried my best without worrying about anything else and its was amazing we would laugh together,cuddle go out and I try my best to Express my affection to her but it's quite difficult when you're always seem as cold hearted and you're trying to Express emotion that's never been there before but she understood and work with it and she seems happy so 3 weeks go by and everything is going well and I honestly think this is gonna work out and...... PAUSE I need to rewind the clock back to the first week i first met her and we ask each other why we were using tinder and she told me she had broken up with her boyfriend let's call him ""Johnny"" about a month ago and that they went out for a couple months and she was just trying to find someone who would treat her right.....CONTINUE on the present we talked about the plans for the weekend and how we should go out and then possibly go out to a club after our date so the week before she comes over as usual.

However, I notice her notification are on do not disturb again so I start pondering but just give it a rest because it's just gonna drive me up the wall so she comes over Friday night we watch a movie but someone keeps calling her nonstop that night and she explains is her friend that has depression the one that was gonna kill himself and I just give her and ok and tell her she can talk to him if she wants and that I don't mind but she replies with I only care about being with you atm. Saturday morning I wake up with a bad case of strept and it bloom out of nowhere so I spend Saturday completely bed written and I told her I was probably gonna go to the ER and have it checked out and that it was better that she went back home so she doesn't get sick. She shrugs my comment off and says that shes gonna be there for me on every step of the way and that theres other place that she rather be and she truly showed me that she cared the entire day she was always giving me a cold water keeping track on my next dose of medicine and she was trying to keep my fever under control and I felt pretty lucky.

Furthermore, my condition only got worse and we end it up going to the ER and we were there all night and the doctors where taking there time but I was going in and out Basically out of it and I would glance at her from my hospital bed and my right hand side and I can see in my peripheral that she was texting and then about 2 hours in the ER her phone started buzzing but she would hang up right away and she was thinking I didn't notice. So I get treated and they have me stay over until I get better so in the morning I tell her to get some breakfast in the cafeteria and call her mom because she wants to talk to her so she leaves to do that and I get up and grab her watch and go through her messages and my intuition was right Johny her ex had out of thin air come back on her messages and some messages she said where ""I'm going laundry rn but we can talk"" or ""after this class is over we can hang out"" and he's replies where "" oh you shouldn't go out of your way for me"" &amp; ("" yes hanging out with you is always the best"") and the night before she came over that weekend she send him a message around 12am to come over and ""hang out"" and he agreed and the convo she had with him with the time I was sick and she was taking care of me was "" I was gonna spend the weekend a friends house but now he got strept and I'm stuck taking care of him and I got all cute to go and out and have fun and now I'm stuck and bored"" and he replied "" oh well that sucks but hey that's what friends are for and he's pretty lucky to have you as a friend"" and then they talked about their day and then at midnight she send him a text saying"" guess where we are now?"" And that's where it ended and he didn't reply the only other thing I found was the suicidal kid let's call him max and he was Basically blowing her up on how he couldn't live without her and that he enjoys spending time with her and she makes him feels special but he wants to know why she hasn't given him an answer if they should give them a chance and she replies with I'm gonna be over at a friends house this weekend so I'll text you when I'm back. At this moment in time my blood is steaming and im ready to blow but I calm myself and wait it out, she comes back and I act like nothing happened I tell her she should go home and finish hw because tomorrow is Monday and she agrees and leaves to meet up with a classmate to go over the notes and tells me they're gonna study next to the library by the dorms.

Me not believing her bs lie I weight and check her snapchat location and she nowhere near the campus and then 2 hours goes by then she leaves and goes to a location near campus and stays there for about an hour then she comes back home and she calls me saying the study session went great and that she came back little more than 2 hours ago I tell her that I'll probably discharge tomorrow(Monday) and that I should be making a full recovery I tell her goodnight and the conversation ends and then I'm on ig just scrolling and watching videos when I get a snap from her so I reply saying ""yea time to get some sleep"" and she replies saying she's getting ready for bed and that I should go to sleep as well but I wait then I check her location again and she's driving to the same place where her ex lives and about an hour go by and I guess she sees that I'm on ig so she sends me a message that I should get some rest then I start poking the bear and telling her she should too and then she tells me shes making music and I really start getting aggravated and really pint point her on her bs and she tells me she's at her friends house and that they're just vibing and making music I stop replying to her and and she just keeps texting its nothing else but at this point I ignore her. The next day I get discharged from the hospital and I check her snap and find out that she turn off her location and then I get a call from her later on that day but I don't answer and ignore her text and then I let her know that I got released from the hospital and that the drugs and lack of sleep caught to me and I'll I done is nap all day and that I'll talk to her tomorrow.

Here we are loosing a night of sleep over this bs just trying to get myself back together on how I'm gonna confront her on this but honestly I think I made up my mind she may have showed the sweetest actions towards me but they didn't mean anything and I don't think it's worth keeping this going. I really need clarity on how to approach this because I was just thinking in ghosting her and not talking to her at all because right now I am furious and at disbelief but hey at least I finally understand why all my friends go back to their exes after I tell them they're gonna get hurt again. If you have any questions feel free to ask I'll try to answer as soon as possible. Tbh I honestly thought it was gonna work out I showed her that I would do anything for her but that's clearly was not enough and don't worry I'm not the type to go back for a third try, I think I disintegrated any feelings that I had toward her over the weekend.

t3_dlr3cs,Getting over being cheated on,"My ex (20F) and I (20M) were dating for 2 years, and it's been about 8 months since we've broken up. We broke up because she cheated on me, lied about it, and I had to drag the truth out of her (she was ""trickle truthing""). We go to the same college and had a lot of friends in common. I've pretty much removed myself from her friend group and have no desire to see her, but she still wishes that we could be friends and wants to give it a chance. I've reduced it to pretty much 0 communication between me and her, but it still hurts to think about everything that happened. One of my best friends (we'll call him Sam, I've known him from before college and he goes here too) has still been friends with her, and it's just weird knowing that they still have a connection. I told him that he could do whatever he wanted regarding their friendship, but I guess I still expected he'd cut it off as that's what I would do. I recently found out they still hang out, and he invited the both of us to a small party recently and I didn't go just because I knew she would be there. I want to be able to live my life at college without being afraid of seeing this girl around and not thinking that my friends aren't loyal to me.

Everything still hurts and it sucks because finding out they are still tight was just a setback for me in terms of recovering. I feel like I deserve more loyalty from Sam, but is it fair to ask that they don't be friends? Is there anything I can do to speed up getting over that relationship or is time/patience the only way? Not really sure what advice I'm looking for, if anyone wants to talk about how they've gotten through horrible breakups/cheating that would be appreciated too I guess.

The guys that she has had things with have not lasted for more than a month. She has also gone back on some of the things she said for the sake of meeting someone. For example, ‚ÄúI do not want to meet someone from X place.‚Äù And then she starts to consider meeting somewhere from X place. I know its okay to take it back, but I think she is only doing it because she wants to be in a relationship badly. I also know that if she wanted to be in a relationship badly she would choose any guy that is down. She is a bit picky but as stated before when she finds someone who is interested in her as much as she is interested in them, she goes head over heels and that is all she talks about. I have tried to give her advice and outlooks on things and she has listened but she feels that she is so ready to jump into love again that she sometimes tends to ignore some red flags or deem them as ‚Äúnot that bad‚Äù if she is really into the guy. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, she has gotten a lot better and I know that in the end, the only person that can help her is herself.  But I still think she might need some more help and different perspectives.",relationship_advice
t3_dls8aa,Boyfriend‚Äôs friends are rude and inconsiderate.,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 7 years, around 2 years into our relationship he met 2 of his now closest friends. Every week we would all meet up and go to a Trivia event. We‚Äôve always all hung out and it‚Äôs been a good time and never issues or awkwardness. This past year, one of his friends got a new girlfriend. We all decided to take a vacation together. I learned really quick how the new girlfriend was. Before we went on the trip she would make snide comments about how we were younger than them and little things like that. Long story short, the time we were on our trip was a nightmare. Every time we suggested something she wouldn‚Äôt want to do it and it was her way or the high way. I realized my boyfriends friend who is dating hers demeanor did a 180. He barley spoke to me and when he did it was after she said something to me. She is quite a bit older than me so I don‚Äôt know if it is an insecurity issue or what. After we went on our trip they barely contacted him anymore. Keep in mind, on our trip we weren‚Äôt afraid to tell her when he weren‚Äôt interested in something. I think she was bothered that we don‚Äôt let her control everything. Long story short my boyfriend is too sweet and quiet to express how he is feeling about it all. Well tonight we all met for dinner and we‚Äôre going to do a Halloween thing as couples and after dinner we all agreed on getting froyo. We drove all the way to the froyo to only have them text us that they were gonna get some alcohol and just meet us there. Keep in mind that we drive almost an hour to hangout with them and they NEVER offer to drive to us. After they texted that, my boyfriend got so upset like I‚Äôve never seen him. He said that‚Äôs it we‚Äôre leaving I‚Äôm done with them doing things like this. I need help on whether or not I should say something to them. I know my boyfriend will sugarcoat it if they ask, and I want them to know. I truly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his friends, I think it‚Äôs the new girlfriend. Do I say something or do I let him?! Thank you in advance and sorry if this is all over the place. There‚Äôs so much more I could add.",relationship_advice
t3_dls6vf,30 Year Itch,"Been married 30yrs. Married when I was very young and for the last ten years it‚Äôs been a nightmare. Husband stopped being interested in sex. We sleep together but aren‚Äôt intimate. I‚Äôve tried to talk to him but he literally ignores me. He says it‚Äôs him not me that he‚Äôs not interested in sex but I know it‚Äôs a lie as he admitted he masturbates. So I lost a massive amount of weight, changed my look and I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm nice to look at. But nothing matters. If I talk to him in bed he goes to sleep. When he comes home from work he generally goes straight to his computer and I sit in our bedroom. The house is disgusting. I do my best but I‚Äôve not got help and I have a chronic illness that makes things hard. I go out every day for my mental health but he refuses to do anything unless he wants to. He won‚Äôt sit and talk to me or go out anywhere with me. He won‚Äôt decorate (he‚Äôs amazing at it) if he does the job is never completed. The garden looks like a jungle. If he mows the lawn he leaves the tools lying. He‚Äôs had relationships with other women - not physical he says but he says he needs to talk. He won‚Äôt say why he won‚Äôt talk to me. I e done everything. I said to him I wanted to meet someone else for sex and he said he wasn‚Äôt happy with that either. When he comes to bed he goes straight to sleep. He‚Äôs been to the doctor and all is well but he refuses counselling etc so basically I have no relationship. I swear I‚Äôve done everything. BUT he‚Äôs an amazing dad and we have a grandchild now. My children are adults and worship their dad as does everyone. So if I left him, my children would never forgive me. I am out of work at the moment so I have no money. No deposit for accommodation. I have a small dog who makes my life worth living but if I went to homeless accommodation I can‚Äôt take him and I don‚Äôt trust my husband to look after him. I‚Äôm close to suicide.

t3_dls1w0,I‚Äôm worried me f(16) and my boyfriend m(16) are too shy and awkward,"So we have going out for a solid month now, and we‚Äôve reached the general landmarks. We‚Äôve held hands, kissed, talk/ hangout all the time. There‚Äôs times when talking to him (particularly over the phone or in text) are great. Convo flows and feels natural. But in person, we really don‚Äôt sync up that well and there are a lot of pauses and breaks in between communication. He‚Äôs said that he gets shy around me, and too be fair, he can be pretty social around friends. But i would say that in general he is pretty shy and doesn‚Äôt really talk to my friends or people he doesn‚Äôt know. 

This makes me wonder if i should continue to build up a relationship and wait for him to open up more, (and for me to become a little less awkward too) or if we really just don‚Äôt sync that well. That‚Äôs my worry- that though we do have interest in each other that in the end we might not just work because he is so shy. (i tend to be more extroverted.) or that as people, we just don‚Äôt connected much deeper than attraction.

Any advice?

t3_dloy4f,"I (32M) called my GF (28F) selfish in a fight recently, and she‚Äôs saying she won‚Äôt be able to forgive me for this and it seems like we‚Äôre about to break up because of it.","Backstory: We‚Äôve been dating for almost 5 years, lived with each other for 4. We both recently graduated college and she‚Äôs trying to get her career started. Her job is the definition of a toxic workplace and has been in this role for about a year now. Not enough support, outrageous demands, ridiculous schedule (she‚Äôs been working about 70+ hours a week recently). Well she comes home stressed pretty regularly and likes to vent for a long time each day, which is fine and normal. I get it.

One thing i‚Äôve personally been upset about is our lack of intimacy. We haven‚Äôt had sex in over two months. She never seems to show interest or affection towards me either. She never even initiates anything (hug, kiss, sex, hand hold etc). She rarely even seems to ask me about how my day goes. I thought she was just caught up in this new job and was too stressed to really do any of that. I‚Äôm not entirely devastated by that, I get that her job is important to her and she‚Äôs doing her best and comes home completely wiped.

Well about a month ago she got a promotion that she was very excited about. I offered to take her out to lunch since we both had the day off surprisingly. Like most days, she talked my ear off for hours and hours all about herself, her job, what her boss said, what this other person said, etc. I was genuinely happy for her, but i‚Äôm starting to resent this job a bit and I feel like the stress is affecting our relationship.

We ended up going home, and some how got into an argument. I mentioned that my feelings were hurt because I felt like the conversation of the entire day(not just today tbh) was very one sided. I mentioned that she didn‚Äôt even ask me how my day went and showed literally no interest in me or anything I had to say about myself. She basically blew up when I said this and jumped down my throat saying how she‚Äôs worked so hard for this, how dare I try to take this away from her, why can I not be happy for her. I told her that wasn‚Äôt the case I just feel a little neglected in this convo and a simple ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù would have kept me at bay.

\*THE MISTAKE\* Things got so heated I dropped the line ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre being really selfish‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure what I said after that, but something along the lines of how i‚Äôm upset that she‚Äôs only talked about herself all day and showed zero interest in me. Well that was about a month ago, and it turns out this has been brewing in her mind and she just can‚Äôt believe I would ever say that. Tbh I don‚Äôt feel like I was too far off. I get it was a bit rude, but she‚Äôs treating this like I cheated on her and this is just something she‚Äôll never be able to forgive me for and our relationship will never be the same again.

How severe was what I said? I get that I made a mistake and could have communicated better, but she‚Äôs treating this like some catastrophic event she‚Äôll never be able to let go of.",relationship_advice

However, now we never call except for wake up calls before school. He is always in the mood for calling, but me on the other hand never seem to want to call anymore. Nothings changed in our relationship in fact it‚Äôs gotten much better since those rough first months. I just don‚Äôt have the will to FaceTime anymore and I feel like it‚Äôs making him even sadder than he usually is because of health problems and family issues. I just don‚Äôt want to tell him I don‚Äôt want to call because it will hurt his feelings so I make up excuses that have kept this going for a while, plus the fact that I really don‚Äôt have a reason why I don‚Äôt want to call other than just not having the energy to. so if he were to follow up my explanation with a question like that then I would be left speechless

t3_dlorcw,"My (18M) girlfriend (17F) turns 18 in two weeks. Her parents still won't let her date, leave the house by herself or do anything independently. We feel trapped.","Me and my girlfriend have been dating (in secret) for just under a year now. Her parents moved to the UK with her when she was 7 and somehow they still haven't adapted from where they came from (a pretty shady part of South Africa). They only let her attend specific clubs at specific times each week -- I met her at the ice rink I worked at as this is one of their 'trusted' locations (but only during very specific hours of the day...). Fortunately they don't check her phone so we've been able to keep a 'long distance' relationship despite her only living a \~30 min drive away.

They're showing absolutely no signs of stopping this behaviour. To add more madness to it all, they're divorced but still living together and constantly arguing. My girlfriend is desperate to escape but they pay considerable money for her clubs which she couldn't afford otherwise. They've also bought her a car to start learning to drive and of course they put a roof over her head. My parents said if she needs to she can live with us for a couple months or so but they don't want her permanently living here which is understandable as they've only met her briefly a handful of times, when picking me up etc... She has a job but it doesn't pay well enough for even the cheapest flats within our county, and I'm much too poor to share a flat with her right now. I'm still living with my parents while I finish my last year at college.

It's like torture for us both. I can't leave her, I love her too much. I assume most of my irl friends probably think I'm bullshitting or seriously over-exaggerating, but everything I've said here is completely true. They totally seem like the kinds of parents to do these things when I've seen them talking to her.

I was very up front and clear about my hatred of marriage and how I didn't want to have children. She said she understood that and that she loves me and wants to be with me. We do love each other very much and we're perfectly compatible with each other save for those two ""huge"" issues. Well the longer we're together the more I feel it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue. I believe that she'd probably stay with me even if I never popped the question and decided to not have children, but that makes me feel like I'm taking something important from her that I can never make up. I don't want to do that to her, but every time I bring up this subject she starts to break down because she says how much she loves me. On the flip side of things I also fear that if I cave and do those things I'll be miserable for the rest of my life and I've only got the one life to live so I honestly don't know what we should do. This is all made worse by her parents trying to push me into ""popping the question"" and treat me like a prop to be used to get their daughter married. I feel like there's a no win situation in this.

Edit:

After making this post, I was able to have a long heart to heart with my SO which I feel opened her eyes to exactly strongly I feel about these things. I also learned that she's on the fence about children herself, she said she's not sure if she said she wants kids because it is expected of her or if she really wants them, so there will need to be some soul searching on that front, the marriage part is a bit more problematic but she understands that it's not just because I don't want to do the paperwork. Some of you recommended that we see a couples therapist so I brought that up again and she agreed so we're going to see a councilor to make sure we can find a happy middle ground that the two of us can be happy with, and if we can't we'll go our separate ways amicably.",relationship_advice

We‚Äôre about to embark on a long distance relationship for under a year due to my job. He is military and will be following to where I will be located. We currently live in an apartment together and I will be leaving pretty soon. He is going to a school after I leave; and right before he gets to our new location. He had asked me to take some of his things to what would be our new place. I said yes, and I honestly was really happy he came up with that idea. It gave me a sense of security because I‚Äôve always been iffy about long distance relationships. I‚Äôm also the type of person who needs to know that things are going to happen for sure and needs something physical to happen to ease my mind about the situation. For example, I‚Äôm planning a party. I talk and talk about planning it all the time but when I finally start making the arrangements to starts the party is when my mind is at ease and I know it‚Äôs for sure happening. It‚Äôs just how I am with any situation. So having some of his stuff already there put me at ease. Well, weeks later he says he changed his mind and doesn‚Äôt want me taking anything. He said this because if he has all his things, his command has no choice but to give him an apartment and not a barracks room (like a dorm room). I said okay, but I was visibly upset so he asked why. I told him why and he said it was ridiculous for me to need that sense of security. He then asked if I could put my feelings aside so that we could have a happy relationship instead of ruining it with my feelings. He kinda just continued to go off on me and basically invalidated my feelings (literally said my feelings aren‚Äôt valid) and so I brushed it off. Moving day for me came, and I asked him again if he wanted me to take anything. And he then flipped out saying ‚Äúcontinuously asking someone to do something steers them away, you know that right?‚Äù and I was taken aback because this dude will continuously ask for blow jobs when I‚Äôm not in the mood, but I‚Äôm still in the wrong then lol. So anyway, I started crying and told him that he was being insensitive. He continued to invalidate my feelings. Idk if I‚Äôm justified or if I‚Äôm being emotional and ruining what little time we have left together. Thoughts?

t3_dlt0yb,Am I [22M] in the wrong with my gf [21F] by trying to be very egalitarian with finances,"Hello r/relationship_advice,

Some backstory: 
My girlfriend of 8 months and I have been having alot of arguments recently due to the fact I try to keep our contributions to the relationship pretty close to 50-50. We're both in college and both don't have alot extra to be spending. Since the start of the relationship I've been a very equal guy, as in if she takes me out then I'll take her out, and if she buys me food then I'll buy her food and vice versa. Its also important to note we take each other out on a surprise date every month and so we do still go on dates semi frequently. We also both have jobs although mine pays slightly more she gets a bunch of scholarship money, but I have student loans and she doesn't.

So recently as of last month we've been having repeated arguments because it's her stance that since she is the girl she deserves to be taken out more and for me to get her gifts/spoil her. My position is that since we're both poor college students 50/50 is fine at least for now. Am I being unreasonable or unrealistic wanting the relationship to be 50/50 or no?",relationship_advice

I have been dealing with this for a while now and I really want to get this out in the open because bottling up my feelings has been overwhelming and unhealthy. I do not have many friends to talk to about this so I hope I can get some help here. English is not my first language.

I have been dating my girlfriend for the past 6 years. I fell in love with her and I was able to be with her after a couple of years of knowing each other. It makes me happy thinking about our beginnings. We have been through a lot together and we have always stuck it out. Communication has been very important and even when we have our issues, we talked and made sure the relationship stayed strong.

About 2 years ago, my girlfriend has been developing anxiety and depression with suicidal thoughts. It took a while to get used to this, but I have tried to be a rock to her. It was difficult in the beginning but I learned on how to deal with this.I made sure I did things for her and let her know I am there for her. It hurts because I know I can't do anything else, but I have been doing my best.

Recently we moved to her father's house to save up money for a place to rent depending on how we do, but she has not been working. The mental issues have really gotten to her and she has been missing work. She has been getting prescribed medicine to help deal with this, but it has been inconsistent. She still has reoccurring episodes and it is interfering with her life. She will not move from bed and will not take care of herself. She is not cleaning up after herself and has started smoking to help deal with her issues. Since this is not my place, I do not feel comfortable anywhere else in the house except in our little space.

It does not help that I am paying for our expenses. I am decently well off and blessed with a good job, but I feel like I am carrying this relationship and it is becoming too much for me to handle. I am no longer happy with the girl i first met and it is painful to say this. I love her with all of my heart, but she is no longer the partner I fell in love with.Mentally, I feel like I am stuck and unhappy. I no longer find joy in anything. My passion is stunted and my smile is fake. I have tried to separate from her but she said without me, there is no point in living and will kill herself.

I do not know what to do. I am stuck because of this and that I am living at her father's house. I can move out, but I am afraid of the repercussions. I do not want to lose my love, my partner, my best friend, but I am not happy. What can I do?",relationship_advice

I was even planning to get a job near him after I graduated college this summer. However, we are having some major communication issues. We have been together for about three years, and he lives across the country so facetiming is a major part of our relationship. 

For the past year, he has been just different. I know he is stressed and depressed, but he definitely put me on the side burner. I tried to be less needy, and I have just piled on more extracurriculars and schoolwork to give us some space (for me to get my mind off him). He sometimes guilts me for hanging out with other people and he is rarely sympathetic to the fact that usually I am also stressed and depressed, but I pull myself together.  He refuses to talk to me more than a couple of sentences a day. We rarely have meaningful conversations and when I let him know that I am getting frustrated an lonely, he bombards me with statements about this depression, and how dumb he thinks he is. I always reassure him that he is not dumb, and that is he lovely, but he never believes me or changes. He refuses to even try and change his communication tendencies. 

All I want is to facetime him without having to stare at the wall or watch him play videogames in silence. I know a good chunk of his behavior is do to (untreated) depression. I just want to know if I am being crazy or not. I honestly love him more than anything, but I am so lonely right now and our relationship is starting to seem very unhealthy.  Should I leave him?

t3_dlsti4,My boyfriend [25M] recently started lashing out at me [25F] and I don't know what to do,"Throwaway account since my bf uses reddit; some details changed but still the same gist¬†

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 years started blowing up at me over small things in the past 3 months. Won't communicate what's going on and doesn't want to break up.¬†

Backstory: I first met my boyfriend when we were in high school, but we weren't friends at the time. We didn't start dating until college started as we ended up going to the same school out of state. Relationship started towards the end of freshman year. Senior year rolls around and I apply for jobs for after graduation. He decided to do an accelerated master's program- so he graduated a year later. Even with starting to go on seperate tracks, it didn't change with us wanting a long term relationship. We both started working in the same city after he graduated, and moved in together. We had stayed over at each other's places in college very consistently, so moving in felt like nothing new. There were some rough patches starting out but we worked through them by talking it out.¬†

At this point we've been together for over 6 years. And what felt like out of nowhere in the past 3 months, he started becoming a huge dick. He would blow up about a plethora of things: I forgot to turn off the light in the bathroom, I used one too many dishes this week (even if I end up doing the dishes), or I left my clothes in the washer. Anytime I made a mistake, it usually didn't happen again. These weren't habitual slip-ups, or things that haven't happened randomly over the course of staying at each other's places in college or in the first two years we were living together. I never raised my voice like he did when I messed up. After the times he yelled, he would apologize. Otherwise it would just be really pissed off remarks. If he had done any of the mistakes I made, he would just say ""So?""or ""It's not a big deal."" It wasn't until last week that I finally brought it up. I asked him why he had to be so hostile all the time. Also why did he never recognize that some mistakes he made were the same ones he yelled at me for. I told him I felt scared not knowing what he was going to yell about. This hit him like a brick. He almost started breaking down and saying he didn't realize he was such an asshole. He said he was stressed from work and didn't realize how much of it he was bringing home. I forgave him and just asked him to be more aware of what he's saying. Even if I'm stressed from work, I never took it out on him. After that conversation, I thought that would be the end of it. Until today. He screamed at me for leaving a bowl next to the sink from the previous day, and threatened to break it. I brought up the same conversation from last week and asked him why he's doing this again. He had the same response- almost crying, calling himself an asshole, saying it's stress from work. This time I asked him if he wanted to break up and he said ""No, how could you say that? I promise I'll be better.""¬†

And it's not like he's a complete a neat-freak. He leaves his clothes lying around, he'll forget to take out the trash. But if I'm making any mistakes, it's not okay. I feel like I'm with a completely different person now. He's been more distant in general, less affectionate than before. I talked to some of our close mutual friends to see if he mentioned something going on with him. None of them said anything. I tried talking to him about his stress from work, or he wants to consider switching companies. He quickly ended the conversation and said he just didn't want to talk about it. Everything has been more tense and I just hate coming home everyday.¬†

I don't know if I should just end it now or wait it out even longer. We've been together for so long, and I do love him. We went from always been open and communicated to each other, until now. He has a pretty good relationship with family so I don't think it's stemming from that either. I've ruled out couple's counseling since I know he's not a huge fan of therapy- I had counseling when I was in college. He supported during that but said he wouldn't want it for himself.¬†",relationship_advice

Yesterday I went on her notes tab to leave her a cute message and there was a note labeled ‚ÄúWays to leave planet Earth.‚Äù I opened it and in there it had a list of different ways she could kill herself such as overdosing, hanging herself, and even getting hit by a car. At the end of the note it said, ‚ÄúBut I could never leave (me) on this earth alone. I would never do that to him‚Äù or something along those lines. 

Earlier in our relationship her sister had a private conversation with me basically telling me that she has been very depressed for a very long time, yet ever since she met me things have changed. Once I saw the note on her phone I went through other notes which contained similar things just explaining how sad she is and how she wishes this ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù will go away and that I am her only hope of light in all this darkness.

t3_dlqzwx,I‚Äôm (19F) intimidated by my bf‚Äôs (22M) sexual history,"Title is basically the TLDR.

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a year now and we are so happy together. We fit really well and genuinely love and care for each other. We‚Äôve been on and off because of our own issues with communication, but that‚Äôs all been smoothed out. 

We met in the same first year university program. He is my first everything. But he has more...experience. We‚Äôve had issues in the past because when we weren‚Äôt together he would hook up with people but did not tell me about it. 

We have had a few conversations where we delved into his past a bit. After he got out of his last relationship (which was 3 hours) he had a bit of a ‚Äúhoe phase‚Äù. When I first learned this I didn‚Äôt mind, but as we‚Äôve explored ourselves sexually with one another I have begun to feel really intimidated. 

We recently played a ‚Äútruth or drink‚Äù card game that was sex themed. I almost couldn‚Äôt answer 89% of the questions because I was so inexperienced. He could answer all of them, which I voiced I didn‚Äôt want to hear about and he respected.

I‚Äôve brought up my feelings to him and he is very understanding, but he has communicated that it makes him fear that because I feel there is an imbalance in our experience and I feel this way I will end the relationship to explore myself sexually. Essentially he thinks I‚Äôll eventually dump him just to fuck other people. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose him. I love him so much and can‚Äôt imagine myself with anyone else. But this intimidation I feel makes me wish we were on the same level with our sexual history. 

How do I get over this or cope with this? Has anyone else felt this way? Are these feelings going to get in the way in the future?

Anyways, he wasn‚Äôt like my previous relationships. He valued me but wasn‚Äôt obsessed with me, we were best friends, had similar interests. He made me believe that relationships might not be so bad after all. It was the best 4 months I‚Äôve shared with someone. However, I criticize myself harshly and remember always being super insecure around him. I had no reason to be, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled with since childhood.

We go to the same uni &amp; before summer break I began to have this gut feeling that this ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù (we never made anything official) was wrong and I needed to get out. I‚Äôve gotten this gut feeling before with previous guys, but I thought he would be different. I told him I get anxious when things get serious, and I needed to work on myself before I invest in myself. This is true.  We stopped talking for 3 months, but he was constantly on my mind. I tried forgetting him by hooking up with another guy, but he wasn‚Äôt him. It didn‚Äôt feel right. We get back to school, and it‚Äôs just been on and off.

t3_dlqurb,"My mother (58f) has a bf (59m) for the first time in 25 years, and she‚Äôs driving me (33f) insane","My mother and I have a pretty good relationship overall, even though we live on opposite sides of the US. We text pretty much every day, and we talk on the phone once a week or so. 

A few months ago, she reconnected with a man she dated as a teenager, they realized there was still something there, and they started dating again. I even got to meet him on a recent trip back home to visit, and he seems like a great guy. 

Some backstory on my mom before I go any further: My parents divorced when I was young because my dad was cheating. My mom was blindsided and got through it all by vowing not to let anyone ever tell her what to do again. She bought a house, worked three jobs while putting herself through college, and got her masters all while raising three kids. She never even entertained the idea of dating anyone for the last 25 years. 

Now here‚Äôs the issue. I feel uncomfortable with the things my mom shares with me about her relationship. She doesn‚Äôt share sexual details, thank goodness, but she complains to me anytime he makes a remark she sees as being critical towards her. 

For example, her bf was present for a recent conversation she had with my brother (30m) and his wife about when they were planning on having a second child. Afterward, my mom‚Äôs bf told her he thought she was rude for asking them, as it isn‚Äôt any of her business. My mom responded by telling him she can talk to her children about anything she wants to because they‚Äôre her children, not his. 

She then turned around and bombarded me with a flurry of texts about the situation, basically saying, ‚Äúcan you believe the nerve of this guy?!‚Äù But like, yeah, I can. He‚Äôs not wrong. She was out of line. 

On the flip side, she also texts me mushy crap about him all the time. For example, she recently texted me, verbatim, ‚ÄúOMG, my hunny is the sweetest man, he‚Äôs just worked his way right into my heart!‚Äù With like fifteen heart emojis. 

The up and down of it is just too much, and I feel like my mom‚Äôs a teenager again. I‚Äôm happy that she has found someone, but Lordy, I just want her to shut up about it, at least to me. How should I approach this situation without coming across like I don‚Äôt support her or her relationship??",relationship_advice
t3_dlsjuk,I (29F) have dreamt about my ex (31M) for 7 years,"TLDR and question at bottom, also on mobile so apologies for formatting. I hope this is the right place to ask.

As title states, I literally haven't stopped thinking about my ex for 7 years. He's not dead or anything. I dream about him atleast once a month, every month vividly and I don't know why. I will call him ""Jim"" for this story.

Some backstory.  Jim and I broke up a little over 7 years ago after dating for 2 years.  It was completely mutual. It was a slow downward spiral. We were both tired and unhappy.  I knew him for a year before we dated and absolutely lusted after him. 

2 weeks after we broke up, (and I know I fucked up here.) But I started dating someone else. it was such a short interval between the two relationships, that my ex, unbelievably upset and accusatory, blocked me on everything: Facebook, phone number, other sites, friends, and eventually email. He said for me to never talk to him again . I sent some emails before he blocked me there, profusely apologizing and saying he didn't understand. (I honestly can't remember what all was said back and forth it was so long ago). He responded plainly and then blocked me. 

Since then, I havent heard a word from him or seen him. Through some friends and happen chance over the years, he started dating a girl I semi knew only a month after we broke up (wowee). She first blocked me on FB but then unblocked some years later (idkwhy bc we aren't even friends).  They got married this year. 

The thing about them, is that she is everything Jim said he hated about me. (Gonna give a real short version of this). He would  Photoshop pictures of me to look fatter so I'd lose weight and tell me to get a boob job. His new wife is bigger now than I was back then. He said piercings and tattoos were disgusting. She has them. Jim abhored alcohol. She drinks it. He wouldn't let us get any more pets. They got 4 extra minimum. He said he would never marry me and it was stupid. They got married.  I only know all this through random photos that popped up on some social media sites And some friends. 

I currently am happily married and have a child as well. I have literally zero desire to be with my Ex. We were a poor match ultimately. My ex was, in hindsight, mean. 

 But I still can't stop thinking of him. When I found out he had a girlfriend, I dreamt of being in their house. I dreamt of him being with me. Every month I dream about him. When I'm awake I don't think about him at all. There is no longing, no desire, nothing. But when I'm asleep I just dream about him. In my sleep, I dream about seeing him at random places and talking. About having lunch , about being in his room. About the past.  When I found out they got married it occurred even more.  I dream we bump into each other and makeout. About him and me dating presently. Some I remember so vividly. I can remember a dream I had about him 4 years ago. 

I just want it to stop. I don't want to talk to Jim, there's zero productivity from that and only drama if so. 


TLDR: mutual breakup. Dated again too soon, ex blocks me on everything. Marries girl that has everything he hated. I can't stop thinking about him when I sleep. Don't care about him awake.

What's wrong with me? Why can't I stop thinking about him? How do I stop? I truly am happier now and just want to live my life",relationship_advice

t3_dlsir8,My (23F) boyfriend (26M) rejected a gift that I got him. Caused a huge fight. What went wrong here?,"Title pretty much says it all. I bought him a calendar from World Market.

t3_dlsicg,How can I(25M) get distanced from her(27F) without hurting her?,"Initially, I tried to date her, but she rejected me for religious reasons. I don't think she will change her view on this.

We haven't been friends for that long, but we keep in contact daily, and we have been meeting at least once per week. We have a lot of things in common so that helps.

I hinted her that our relationship won't be the same forever as we are just friends , and because life will get in the way at some point ,  but she replied things like ""I want to have you in my life forever"" or ""your support is truly important for me and missing you will make me very sad""

At the same time, I feel that she is just lonely and happened to meet someone who cares about her for the first time. She said that this is the first time that anyone ""cared so much about her"" and that is ""great to be taken care of"". She is very supportive and appreciative, so I don't think that she is taking advantage of me.

I don't know if it will be selfish to say something like ""I appreciate you having in my life, and taking care of you, but I am developing very strong feelings for you and it just hurts to have you around"". Should I write her a letter? Many times I felt very strong needs to hold and kiss her, and obviously friends don't do that. Perhaps she should know about this.

I feel that she is lonely, and that my support is truly helping her. At the same time some feelings are just hard to cope for me, and it is not that easy to be kind and take all that in. It is also taking a lot of time and energy to support her, and  I am also starting to have problems to look at other women so that does not help either.

I tried to reduce contact with her, but that did not work. She does not have any problem starting and keeping the conversation. I don't feel that she deserves to be ignored, blocked or ghosted.

t3_dlqswh,My [30M] sex life is non-existent and I'm beginning to lose touch with my marriage's sexuality,"Short bio: 30M married to 32F for 6 years, been together for 11 years. I've had a non-existent sex life for a few years now (Yes, I've heard of /r/deadbedrooms  \- I want some real advice, not bitter ideas. I have enough of those on my own)

Years after, she's making an effort, but I cannot respond to her. I don't feel it anymore, not that my libido is dead, she just can't trigger it now. Perhaps I'm too bitter, or perhaps I used my imagination to explore sexuality for so long that now it's disconnected from her.

I was thinking on trying to go to a sex club or something to perhaps get us in the mood or something. Perhaps if we became aroused around each other we'd reconnect that aspect of our lives. As it happens some of our closest friends (couple) went to one, and when I asked my wife to do it she immediately rejected the idea. Probably jealousy?

I don't know how to approach this or try to explore while keeping her happy, but I do know I loathe how things are. I love her very much though and I cannot imagine life without her.

Apparently we both are very conflict avoidant, which doesn't help us at all.

t3_dlsg82,Why does my BF stay if he thinks I‚Äôm so annoying?,"My boyfriend acts bothered by anything I say unless it‚Äôs his conversation or something he wants from me. He wasn‚Äôt always like this.

t3_dlsg2n,My (24 f) boyfriend (25 m) shut me out for two hours because he argued with his dad,"My boyfriend and I (together for 2 years) were supposed to meet up in my house at 9 pm. As close as 30 mins before that he messaged saying he‚Äôd be over at 9, was just taking a shower. Everything was good. I got ready, waited, 9 pm came and he never showed. At 9:15 I sent him a message asking if he was on the way. Still nothing. At 9:30 I figured he might have fallen asleep, however he would have been annoyed if he hadn‚Äôt woken up so I called him and nothing. Normally he would hear his phone even if he was asleep.

At about 9:45 I was a little worried so I drove the 10 mins over to his house just to make sure he was ok/had fallen asleep on the couch and he wasn‚Äôt there. The car was gone. At this point it was getting close to 10pm I was worried, had no idea where he could be. I drove back to mine and messaged his friend just in case he‚Äôd heard from him. And no. At 10:30 I decided to drive around a bit, I was genuinely worried something could have happened to him. And on the way past a bar I spotted his car outside and a few minutes later him come out of the bar and into his car. 

That was around 11pm, two hours after we were supposed to meet up in mine. I drove home and got a message as I got home saying ‚Äúon the way over now‚Äù. When he got in I questioned him and asked why he didn‚Äôt reply/disappeared for 2 hours and his excuse was he had to give his dad a lift somewhere and then had a big argument with him. I asked why he didn‚Äôt just send me a quick message to let me know. He said he was too stressed/just couldn‚Äôt. I then asked him if we went to a bar after and he lied and said no.

Am I being overly picky/needy or is this problematic and he‚Äôs being selfish and immature? I admitted to him that I saw him leave the bar and he told me he didn‚Äôt want to tell me in case I‚Äôd argue. 

The problem isn‚Äôt really going to the bar, it‚Äôs that he left me in the dark for 2 hours not knowing where he was. All I needed was one quick message just to say he didn‚Äôt space for an hour or two and it would have been fine.

t3_dlod1a,I don't know if I should tell my mom about my childhood sexual abuse,"Whats up! Welcome to my post.

As the title goes, I don't know if I should tell my about when I was abused as a child. It happened for a couples years when I was around 3 years old (by a family member), and quite honestly I was able to keep that burden locked down for a very long time. 

Recently, I just came to terms with the abuse. I finally, within the past couple weeks, have been able to actually call it sexual abuse. I know realized that it has caused me great emotional and mental health, as well as distorted my view in relationships, sex, and companionship. I am okay and healing from all this. Still working on finding my peace in all this, and forgiving myself for everything. It has, however, really fucked up my mood. 

I leave for the Marine Corp ('MERICA) in about a month. I just finished up college (yay!) and so when my lease was up I moved back in with my mom to cut expenses before I ship out. I think that she has noticed a considerable shift in my mood (I'm more irritable, stand off-ish, melancholy) because of me grieving, and it has caused us to really get into some arguments. I havent been working out/studying/or preparing to ship as much as she thinks I need to be. I have been spending my weekends with friends (and yes we drink and go to bars, I'm young), but shes blaming them as the distraction and the reason for me slacking off. When in reality its my suffering mental health. Even saying that I'm ""throwing everything away."" My mother is an amazing woman with the emotional and mental resiliency that I strive to have in life. She has overcome so much, which is why I don't know if I should tell her. I don't want to burden her with something I know I can work through on my own, when she has already dealt with so much pain in her life. 

So, thoughts?

t3_dlqn5m,I don't trust my best friend,"Some backstory is required here.

I(m19) met my first online friend(f23), honestly my only close friend ever, back in 2017 when I was 17. We met playing a common game together. Over the next 2 years we've gotten very close. We both have serious mental health issues, and it was nice to have someone to rely on. But then the issues started. There was always something wrong. An injury, an illness, a dead family member. She lost an uncle and a grandma, has a brain tumor, has constant small injuries, or is sick. She has a young daughter too, and was apparently raped by her ex husband. We have voice chatted and video chatted, so Im pretty sure it isnt phishing, and shes never asked for anything. We've tried to meet up several times, but shes always canceled at the last minute for one reason or another. Im a very empathetic person, so everything she tells me really affects me. Today she told me she was being abused for the past year, and nobody believes her, including the police, as well as mentioning she is going blind. I cant help being suspicious, and it hurts being suspicious of my best friend. But there is just so much. And then today, I looked up her uncle, the one who died recently. The only person of that name who died in her area died 3 years ago in 2016. I dont know what to do. My first instinct is to call her out, but she is suicidal, and I dont want to trigger it. If I take any action, and Im wrong, Im likely consigning someone I care about to abuse and death. I don't know what to do. Every day is hard, hearing about whatever new problem there is. Im getting more and more depressed, and I don't know how long I can last.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqn31,Was I date raped? Story of night included,"So there was this nice looking guy I talked to on tinder months ago now.  I didn't use it for a long time,  but I was lulled into this sense of safety with him.  He acted like he understood me so well,  and said how he never felt this way about anyone before.  It made me feel special so I went along with it.  After a few weeks we met up and decided to go for some drinks. I really warmed to him at first,  he was acting nervous with his leg shaking and he made a joke of it.  I felt very comfortable with him.  

I remember finishing after the second beer my guard was way down,  and I was now opening up to the atmosphere.  We were in a beer garden and some people approached we start talking to them,  laughing etc... He slips out to get more beers,  I didn't think twice about it when he came back,  I was drinking the alcohol like a fish,  next thing I know I was dancing all around the bar,  and making a complete fool of myself,  all my inhibitions were gone.  The strange thing is I don't even dance,  I never dance in public ever.  I didn't care what I looked like,  it felt like I was having the time of my life.  What is really strange about this is that alcohol has never had that affect on me ever.  I don't think I was drugged either, I didn't pass out or anything, I was able to dance etc... Looking back it seems I was on something a lot more than alcohol. 

So moving on from this,  I remember I got really bad blisters on my feet from all the dancing like a maniac around the place,  which is the opposite of me.  I remember he gave me his socks to wear and I put on flats.  That is the last vivid memory I have of that night. He then casually said to leave, I would never go to someone's place I never met,  I was acting like a child and lost all normal thinking and feeling of my independence.  I have no memory of the taxi at all.  I don't remember the taxi driver,  I don't remember riding in the taxi,  I have no even vague pictures of it.  Its as if it never happened. The next thing I have a memory of is walking into his apartment and seeing a ton of shoes in the hallway,  and commenting on it,  and him saying something back.  I didn't feel scared,  but it was like I was having an out of body experience.  I have no memory of going to the bedroom,  or taking off any clothes or anything,  I have one or two vague snapshots in my head of him penetrating me without a condom,  and having no will to do anything about it.  It was as if I passed out after I took those two snapshots with my eyes,  cause I've no other memory.  The shoes in the hallway,  and the vague snapshot of him penetrating me,   is all I have after putting the socks on in the bar. 

I woke up the next day,  feeling very out of it,  spaced,  disorientated,  and a complete mess.  I remember  he looked so awake and healthy, I immediately feeling humiliated and embarrassed and was blaming myself for the state I was in.  I was only planning on having a drink or two with this guy and next thing I am in a terrible condition in his bed.  I didn't have any memory at this point. I remember him confiding in me that He had sex with men,  at this point I am freaking out internally,  about what this guy could have passed to me. He went to make toast,  I ended up having some,  he says I can use the shower if I want. I felt invaded,  and needed to leave. When I go to get the bus home I realize I am in this really dodgy part of the city,  and am feeling so empty and gross about myself,  I felt so low and depressed.  I have now done a HIV test after worrying for weeks about it  and am anxiously awaiting the results.  I feel like throwing up when I think of that night.  I wasn't even in a state to ask to use a condom, he took advantage of that.  In hindsight he took advantage of me by not putting me in a taxi to go home, do you think it is all my fault? I am full of self blame now and have been since thinking how stupid can you be,  you created this mess,  and now you could be Ill for life. Very down and out about this,  I don't know how to handle this,  I allowed this to happen. It's all my fault.",relationship_advice

The relationship after the break up has been up and down, we could talk for weeks and then go NC for months. We recently got in touch again and something is different this time. I've invited her to come to my new flat and she says she would be down, she is also up for doing hanging out with me other times too, as friends or because she wants more? But she doesn't make this very clear, shes very concealed with her feelings. There is definitely a spark between us, there always was and that never faded even after the break up. Im so awful at confessing to a girl my feelings and what not or trying to make a move on them that doesnt come off awkward, so my question is

How should i go about her coming to my flat? What should i do to make her feel like i do fancy her? I want to make a move on her but how can i do this in a way thats not awkward or will leave her disappointed? When i say make a move i dont mean sex, maybe just a simple kiss, but something which shows her that i dont want a friendship i want a relationship again

t3_dlo7mu,My (23M) girlfriend (22F) of 3 years cheated on me.,"Sorry for the long post I need this.
We've been together for 3 years, the first two years were heaven on earth, yeah we had our arguments but nothing that couldn't be solved.
We went through everything together, she met my family I met hers, we we're sure we will eventually get engaged and married and so on.
Everyone used to tell me that I was the best boyfriend she could ever have and that she was the best girlfriend I could ever have, we were perfect for each other and we were both treated in an amazing way.
Then the third year happened, she started to avoid me sometimes, not allow me to hold or touch her (both intimate and normal ways), she wouldn't kiss me, we had many many fights concerning the subject of her not treating me well anymore, it felt like she's drawing herself away, we even broke up for a few days because she thought it was a good thing for both of us, and she came crawling back because it was a bad decision, she tried to be better (but still wouldn't kiss me and would barely allow me to hold her hand). Then I found out the truth, she was cheating on me with a ""close"" friend of mine, they became friends a couple of months back and apparently she was kissing him and sending him ""pictures"" and doing NSFW shit with him (but no s*x). For a week she did all of this then she felt guilty and decided to end everything because she loves me. Once I found out 5 months later I started crying in front of her and started to yell and scream and shout, she was crying because she ""loves"" me and she ruined everything, she couldn't stop crying she explained that she was disgusted by her acts and that she wanted to fix things. After an hour of talking I drove her to her university, she has pharmacy exams and she's failing all her courses and getting shit grades because of how depressed she is, she told me once she finishes her exams we will talk about what to do with our lives. 

I never hated someone more, because I believed in her I trusted her I put all my faith in her, and yet I want to be with her, I need to be with her I crave her both physically and mentally and emotionally, and I hate myself for this. I don't know what to do I just came here and wrote everything.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsalx,My (19F) boyfriend (21M) hurt me today but he never did anything like that before,"He came over to my apartment after his class and he did bad on an exam so he was upset and in a bad mood. I wasn‚Äôt feeling good either, I had bad period cramps so I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to be comforting him. He was just acting like a baby, he wanted me to get food for him and cuddle him. I know he was upset but I get intense period cramps and I wasn‚Äôt feeling like spoiling him. He was annoyed that I wasn‚Äôt giving him attention and then I was on my phone and he was upset that I wasn‚Äôt talking to him. I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk. He complained that I was on my phone and he asked me who I was talking to and I said no one because I was just scrolling thru Instagram. He didn‚Äôt believe me and he tried to grab my phone from me which he‚Äôs never done before and I wouldn‚Äôt let him so I snatched it back and told him to leave me alone because I have cramps and he was being annoying. I wasn‚Äôt even talking to anyone but it just bothered me that he was trying to grab it from me like I‚Äôm a child. Then he seriously randomly slapped me across my face really hard and started choking me like squeezing my neck so hard with both of his hands, it hurt so bad, it felt like my whole face was purple. He never hit me before, it was so unexpected and weird and random like it was someone else. My boyfriend is not like that, he‚Äôs usually the most sensitive sweet guy ever, definitely not the type to ever HIT SOMEONE. He made me think he was the type to never hurt a fly. I was so confused and scared about what was going on. It seriously felt like a real assault or attack. It wasn‚Äôt just a small slap or something, I have all these red blood vessels on my cheek now. I can‚Äôt believe my own boyfriend did that to me. I think that he assumed no one else was home since I was in the living room but my roommate was in her room and she came out and screamed at him to stop. Then he just ran out. Since then, he‚Äôs texted me a few things like how he‚Äôs so sorry and he feels so bad. I didn‚Äôt reply to any of it because I don‚Äôt know what to say. Apparently doesn‚Äôt know what got into him and he asked me if my cramps got better. I didn‚Äôt know this but he told me that his dad used to hit his mom and that it ruined his childhood and he has a lot of trauma and problems and he wants to start therapy and he wants me to go with him so we can talk about what happened and figure it out. 

Honestly I‚Äôm just really confused. It was like he did a complete 180. He was fine this morning and we‚Äôve been dating for a year, he never acted like that before. Then he got his bad test grade and I wasn‚Äôt feeling in the mood to comfort him and he just slapped me and started choking me which he never ever did before. It was like another person. This is the guy who doesn‚Äôt even like rough sex because he feels too scared of hurting me. I just feel so. Confused. That‚Äôs the only word I can use to describe this feeling. I saw a stranger today. Like something possessed him. Please help me. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

t3_dls9og,My [31/m] friend [28/m] has became an Incel,"As the title says, my **[31/m]** friend **[28/m]** has became an Incel.

Let me elaborate this and sorry for the grammar since english is not my first language. Warning, this is going to be a long post.

So an old friend of mine has slowly became an incel during the last year and a half. He was a normal guy in terms of women, he had a girlfriend, he was training and studying a government exam to became a policeman and working as a cook at the same time. He was joyful and a good guy.

18 months ago he passed the physical tests and the exam to became policeman, but in the last selection baremo, an interview driven in this case by 2 girls (this is important) he was sacked. This 2 girls are kinda known in that world for being biased in favour of woman, not a lot of men get the green light from them and male applicants are afraid of having to do the interview with them. Truth is that a lot of people pass all the test but the government has to thin out the final candidates and a lot of good people (and I guess also bad) get kicked out. Also it's true that a way bigger percentage of women pass this last test than men. Even if the percentage of men passing all the previous tests is bigger, but nowdays the government wants to be more inclusive and get more women to be policeman. Not 100% fair but that's what it is, what are you gonna do. He trained &amp; studied hard for 2 years for that chance.

No long after that his girlfriend left him. You know, the typical, it's not you, bla,bla, bla. A while after he was told that she was fucking others guys and even if I used to like the girl (she was funny and nice to be around), she was a total piece of shit and made him suffer.

So slowly but sureley he started to get in a depression, he is always sadder and sadder. He got another job as cook (tbh is a shitty job and he hates it, but what you gonna do).

I tried to encourage him to train for the policeman tests again but he has always refused so I don't even try anymore. Always that I know of some kind of official examns for government jobs I let him know and encourage him to study them so he can get out of the restaurant life. But he never does.

He has became more and more depressed over time and what is worse, he really despise women. Slowly but sureley he has became a true incel in the last year and a half. His comments about women are becoming worse and worse. Calling all of them who*#es, bitch#*s, ""what do you expect from a woman?"" comments, etc.

I laugh those comments off trying to not entering in conflic with him. But they are becoming more and more prominent as time passes. And his usual group of friends are not helping with it cause they are kinda like that too. He is also becoming more extremist with his political ideas (far right).

I'm trying to help him, some time ago he asked me to go bouldering with him and I did, and I really loved it. Now it's my n¬∫1 hobby but he doesn't practice it anymore. I still play videogames with him and I try to get him to do stuff on his free days (climbing, go to the cinema, go have some beers, etc). But he is kinda refusing every time more and more this offers. 

He is deeply depressed (doesn't want to hang out, told me he doesn't clean his apartament, etc) and I'm trying to get him out of it. He also refuses to go out and try to met a girl, join Tinder, anyhting. He totally refuses, cursing about women and how shitty they are, insulting them every time anything related to them comes into a conversation. I think the interview thing and his exgirlfriend have been a huge toll in his mental health.

I like this guy and he is a good person, but this behaviour is going worse and worse with time, and at this point im kinda embarassed of him (I would never introduce my girlfriend to this guy cause I would be afraid she could think that I share any of his ideas). He is deeply depressed and a total incel and I don't know how to get him out of this toxic loop. I think getting him to know a girl would help him greatly, but I don't know if it's a bit too late since his behaviour towards women is kinda shitty and he is not the cutest guy around either. I don't think I can talk straight to him about this cause he will brush it off or tell me to go to hell and cut his relationship with me. So I'm lost, but I also want him to change before he gets to the point I have to just cut him off of my life.

TLDR: Because of some events related with women and a shitty job, my friend has became an Incel and got into depression in the last year and a half and I don't know how to deal with this.",relationship_advice

His Mom on the other hand has recently chosen that I am the anti christ and shall rain hell upon her child.....

A bit more background:

So My step mom has a nasty habit of being full of shit and so me and my boyfriend split up for a bit (two months) it was something we both needed but not something I would ask for... so we broke up because his mom told mine I apparently slept with 7 people well with him..... I didn‚Äôt sleep with anyone but I had a bad addiction problem and fooled around with my drug dealers but I am clean and we worked past it ( we got in a fight and talked it took a bit but we got through it) it has been a bit but I have always made sure to insure him I understand why he gets nervous or mad about guys ect. ( I just don‚Äôt talk to anyone but him now NOT because I‚Äôll cheat but because I don‚Äôt like being watched even though I understand why) so fast forward to this summer we split for the 2 months and I get in a situation where I‚Äôm homeless and living in a tent with a dog so I start sleeping in his car, we get back together, and I‚Äôm still in the car, at this point his mom didn‚Äôt hate me yet. 

So I‚Äôm sleeping in this car every night and it‚Äôs getting cold as shit so one day she comes back from work hella early and tells me to get off the property and I‚Äôm not welcome... I am shocked and don‚Äôt understand but I comply and pack my stuff (slow) she asks my boyfriend to go inside and I take probably 20 minutes to pack a small backpack. My boyfriend came out crying so me now pissed asks what she said... apparently well I was homeless I contacted my parents (kicked me out) to tell my mom how he is abusive!!! Like this woman knows my mother lies they work together it‚Äôs a small town but she picked to believe her after my mom lying about something she[ boyfriends mom] said and we had to clear it up 5 months prior { being that she said I slept with 7 people whe I didn‚Äôt my mom said she said it and she (boyfriends mom said she didn‚Äôt we talked and I picked to believe she didn‚Äôt}

Basically we've been together for almost a year, in the same program and at the same universities taking the same courses. Meaning we have the same amount of assignments and tests. 
I'm his first relationship and he's my first serious and longer termed one.


he spends all his time on school work, whether reading his notes the textbooks or practice questions and doing assignments etc and I get that as a student school is important and a main focus but his actions just makes me feel unreasonable for asking him to spend any time with me, and even if he does spend time with me his mind is always on school reviewing concepts and such.


He would only come over at like 11pm when he's done everything and just sleeps, like barely any conversation or simple couply things like sharing how their day went, no kissing or anything beyond that either, literally just to sleep and make me ""happy"" so I'll stop whining that he never spends time with me. 


The thing is, we weren't always like this, for last school year we were much closer, he would come at like 6 or 7 pm and we would cook and eat together then work together too then he'll stay over and we'll go to class together in the morning. And everything was fine, he got good grades and all, I wasn't much of a ""distraction"".


At first I didn't think much of it, but now I'm doubting his intentions last year, we lived way closer then (before 3 mins walk, now, 10 mins walking) and he hated his dorm and hated spending time there due to the conditions (he shared one room with a roomate while I had private room and access to a kitchen and own washroom, while he shared those with his entire floor). So due to these factors, I'm starting to think we only did so much together cause it was convenient and essentially better for him.


But this year since he has his own room and living with close friends we never spend time after school hours, and during school hours it feels like we're forced to be together since we have the same classes but it's not quality time or anything since his roommate tags along in all the classes too. So we never get any ""couple time"" alone whatsoever. 


I get that school is important to him, it's important for all of us, but the fact he can just push me to the side and only do enough to satisfy the minimum makes me feel so dependent and needy. And makes me question whether if I'm just being too sensitive and this is how it is, like how true adult relationships work, since this is my first serious and long term one. I don't know how much to expect from him and wasn't sure if I was just too hopeless romantic living in this perfect fantasy world I created in my mind that he, as a human cannot uphold to.

Another factor is that I'm dumber than he is, so I'll always ask him to clarify or explain questions to me, while his roommates are smarter than he is, so he goes to them for answers, which is also why I think he spends so much time with them. But this is just a side thing that makes me feel useless. I try not to ask him school related questions anymore so he doesn't get annoyed at me.


So idk if I'm being unreasonable and should suck it up since we all have our individual lifes or that I should just give up and leave this relationship 



I've talked to him about this issue before and while he acknowledged and understands where I'm coming from, things haven't really changed. 
When I'm with him, he seems genuine and actually wants to be with me, it's just he's not with me much. 


P. S. He's also never said ""I love you"" to me before which idk if that's a bad sign or it means he's serious about those words since I'm his first relationship.",relationship_advice

t3_dlqe2u,No affection in an otherwise good marriage,"My wife(38F) and I(36M) have been together for 11 years. We have had very few issues in our marriage and, when the rare issue arises, we always discuss it calmly and are both pretty quick to admit wrongdoings and apologize. I'm lucky and I know it.

The one issue I have is that she almost never shows any type of physical affection. She often reciprocates if I initiate but at other times it feels like she is just tolerating me and I will disengage. I could chalk this up to me simply misreading her moods but I don't think that is likely as everything else, all the little things in a long term relationship that you learn to gauge, will be completely normal when this happens.

When being intimate I always have to be very aware because if I try to ""get her in the mood"" she won't show any sign that she is interested like, at all. But then if I shy away and decide maybe it isn't a good time/she isn't into it she will be like ""why did you stop?""

She appreciates when I give her compliments and show her attention. She tells me that she loves me (and I know she does) but she never shows any kind of affection. I have purposely stopped initiating physical contact before and we went for two weeks without even a hug before I finally caved. She never even noticed. During that time we kept interacting as normal. We did the same things, made the same jokes and if you had asked her, things would've been great. She didn't know it was killing me. 

We've discussed this before and I have tried to make my feelings known but it doesn't change. I get that some people just aren't affectionate and I have tried to make peace with that but it is difficult for me because I am a very affectionate type.

The other morning when I woke up she was awake and lying with her back to me on her phone. I got up to pee and brush my teeth then got back in bed. When I kissed her cheek she smiled but never looked away from her phone. I laid there and and rubbed her back a bit and, tbh was hoping to get her in the mood but after a few minutes of her ignoring me and just scrolling fb I gave up. I wasn't mad but I was hurt. I tried not to let on or to make a big deal of it. 

This has happened many times and it is wearing me down. I don't mind being turned down for sex and a simple ""some other time"" would be fine but being ignored is crushing. It makes me feel invisible. 

This last time has really hit me hard and now I don't even want to be affectionate with her. I have been distant these last few days and she's noticed because I can't hide it very well right now. I'm heartbroken. She brought it up today before I went to work and I told her it wasn't a good time but we could talk later. Thing is, even if we discuss it again I still don't want to make myself vulnerable with her anymore because I dont think this will ever change.

I just, idk i guess im really missing his hugs and kisses and he is just so kind to me so im missing that affection and warmth and well with my parents being so strict about this I cant really get excited about meeting him during his break. 

I was just gonna tough it through or let this situation pass, but it was bothering me so much so I had to let it out somewhere where I wouldnt be considered whiny or annoying.",relationship_advice
t3_dllml6,I think [30M] I messed up in an argument and now she [26F] wants space to think,"TL;DR: Girlfriend and I got into an argument via text about my feelings on her not being upfront about us being in a relationship online. The argument got out of hand and now she wants a few days to speak about it.

I want to preface this by saying we both stream on Twitch, which is the crux of where the argument comes into play. We met on Twitch, it‚Äôs a long distance relationship, but we‚Äôve met multiple times in the few months we‚Äôve been dating.

I‚Äôm looking for a few things here: First a gut check ‚Äì¬†am I being controlling here? Second, what‚Äôs a better way I could have approached this topic? And last, if she gives me a chance to talk through things, how do I proceed?

The argument started Saturday when we were in a mutual friend‚Äôs stream. We have a reputation for being very playful together in chat ‚Äì nothing lovey dovey, it‚Äôs more like teasing and rib poking. One of the viewers, who is also a viewer in our respective channels, asked us if we were a couple. It‚Äôs not something we‚Äôve disclosed openly but we‚Äôve had a conversation about it off stream and decided that we wouldn‚Äôt hide our relationship if it was ever brought up. I wasn‚Äôt present in chat when the question was initially asked but when I came back I saw that she ignored it.

I messaged her privately saying that I saw she dodged the question and she said it caught her off guard and she didn‚Äôt want to blast her business in someone else‚Äôs chat. I said ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôll just tell everyone I‚Äôm single. NBD.‚Äù Which, in hindsight, wasn‚Äôt something I should have said. I apologized but told her that her hiding our relationship on Twitch like that really bothered me because we said we would be open about it. I also brought up that she hadn‚Äôt told her family about us yet even though she said she was going to in multiple instances.

I‚Äôd like to recreate the conversation as much as possible because I want it to sound objective but it‚Äôs too long. The general idea is that I told her I‚Äôd like her to at least acknowledge that we are in a relationship if it every comes up in conversation. She told me that it was something that she was willing to do but that she wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing it and that she would need time to do it.

I think I got pushy in my argument because I pulled out examples in the past where weird things happened in chat that could be avoided if people knew she was in a relationship. And I kept asking her why it was so important that she hide that she‚Äôs in a relationship when she discusses other details of her personal life on stream. She told me that her privacy was important to her and that even if she dated someone who lived in the same city as her, she wouldn‚Äôt disclose that information online either. It‚Äôs important to note that she doesn‚Äôt disclose relationship info on any social media platform ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think this is a big deal because I don‚Äôt either, I‚Äôm just sharing it to show that she is consistent in her stance.

My intention with the questions was to simply try and understand her side of the argument better so I could try and see things from her perspective, but I didn‚Äôt feel like she ever really explained it to me. I feel like I came off aggressive through the text even though I was just hurt by it. Everything ended Sunday morning (it was a 2-day fight) by her saying she‚Äôd be open with things online ‚Äì essentially giving into my resolution, which I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with because I wanted to work toward a resolution together. Regardless, the conversation was over and we didn‚Äôt speak again until Sunday when I hopped into her stream.

She acted normally in the stream. We joked back and forth and she made a few comments alluding to our relationship ‚Äì she was making an effort to do what I asked. This made me feel like shit because I know that‚Äôs not what she wanted and I feel like I pushed her into that without making more of an effort to understand where she was coming from. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to explain that.

After the stream on Sunday evening, I didn‚Äôt hear from her until I texted her late that night asking if she was gone for the night. She said she wasn‚Äôt and that she was at a friend‚Äôs house because her friend‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. We talked about that for a bit and I asked her if she would like to call when she got back home. She said yes and we hopped on a call when she got home.

The conversation was kind of awkward and I asked if we were okay. She kind of hesitated and said things were okay but she felt sore about the argument. Totally understandable, I did, too. I asked if she wanted to get off and she said yeah, she needed time to think about things. I said okay and she asked if we could hang out Monday night.

Fast forward to Monday, I respected her space and waited for her to message me. She finally did after 5 p.m. and said that she wasn‚Äôt ready to talk, she wanted to talk later in the week. I was admittedly pretty confused and asked if she was thinking about breaking up with me. She didn‚Äôt say yes or no, just that she needed time to think about how things went down over the weekend.

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship where we‚Äôve waited to talk about something like this and it‚Äôs honestly killing me a little bit. But I messaged her back saying that I felt like I treated her unfair and that‚Äôs not how I wanted conflicts between us to be resolved. I also said that I wanted to respect her space and that I would be here to talk when she was ready.

I‚Äôm currently dying on the inside because I‚Äôm confused about what‚Äôs happening, I feel guilty for hurting her and I feel like I royally screwed things up.",relationship_advice
t3_dls265,I (22F) meeting with ex for coffee and need some advice!,"It‚Äôs been almost 5 months since my ex broke it off with me. I was deeply upset since this was my first break up and decided to block him off of social media until I was completely over him. We ended in good terms so I thought, ‚Äúeh, I‚Äôll run into him when we‚Äôre both in good shape‚Äù, but I noticed something weird. He would text me on certain occasions asking me about how I was doing and asking me about my workout stuff which I found a bit strange. Like now you wanna worry about my life? I obviously would leave him on read or not reply at all. When he was persistent with the texts, I would reply in an uninterested manner just so he would stop replying. Last week, he asked about my week and I left him on read. Then I decided to ask him about college stuff just to see if he would respond and he did shockingly. I said a couple of things and took control of the chat. Then he asked me to meet up with him Friday morning for coffee and I guess to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù.

t3_dloyfe,My (19F) roommate (19F) is being particularly disrespectful and rude towards me. I'm having mixed feelings about reporting her to the dorm administrator.,"Long post, TL;DR at bottom. 

A month ago I started university in a city far from home, so I live in a student dormitory with 3 other girls. We were placed in this room at random, so we did not know each other previously. One month later, I'm having trouble living everyday life because of one of them. For this post's sake, I'll call her Em. The other two are Laura and Deli. 

First of all, she's loud. Loud talking, even louder laughing, and absolutely zero respect for people sleeping in the room. There have been multiple occasions where she and the other roommates would come in the room late at night (2-4 AM) and Em is the one who talks the loudest, followed closely by Deli. Mind you, I go to sleep very early compared to them (11Pm or midnight, compared to 3-4 in the morning), but I really need those hours of sleep in order to function. I'm also a light sleeper, so I often wake up to the sound of the door opening, but what bothers me is Em's complete disregard for the fact that 1. It's late at night and 2. I'm sleeping. I'd totally accept being woken up by the door or their footsteps, but I believe that loud talking and laughing is an asshole move. I've told her to keep it quiet, but she has not changed it so far. 

Speaking of loud. She often plays whatever music she likes in the room. Out loud, maximum volume, no headphones. It doesn't matter if somebody is studying or reading in the room, she will blast the music whenever she likes. I've told her that I don't like her music and I wish she would at least turn it lower so I don't have to hear it through my headphones, but she did nothing about it. When I'm not studying I usually don't comment about it, but I really would like to learn in peace. Same thing when she's watching TV series. She also laughs so much, and so loud, you can hear her from the hallway. Em's laugh often causes Deli to laugh, which is equally loud, if not louder. Again, I wouldn't be bothered if they laughed during the day. But they do it at night when I'm trying to get some shut eye. 

Another thing that bothers me about Em is how bossy and autoritary she is. We made a cleaning schedule that we all agreed to, and last week was my turn to clean. I did clean the room, sweep the floor and everything, but only when nobody was in the room. I don't like cleaning with people around, that's just me. So I cleaned when I was alone. At the end of the week, Friday-Sunday, I was very busy. I spent the day over at my boyfriend's place on Friday, then went to a comic con Saturday and Sunday. I came to my room exhausted and went straight to bed. Sunday evening when I was getting ready to sleep, Em started bitching at me how I didn't do my chores, didn't clean and left a mess on my desk. Granted, my desk was a bit unordered, simply because I couldn't find something that morning and I frantically searched for it. However, she kept insisting that I should have swept the floor that weekend, no matter how tired I was, and that the room was filthy and she had to clean in my place because she couldn't bear it. We got into an argument about cleanliness in the room and she said that the room stank because of me, that the empty, closed jar on my desk was the reason it smelled of food in the room. I pointed out that Deli's late with an uneaten steak since last night was out on the table, but she ignored me saying that Deli's food wasn't her business. 

She constantly says that I'm the reason the room smells, that I'm being the messiest of us all. I will concede that I'm messy, but my desk is full of pens and papers and notebooks. I'm an artist and all my stuff gets scattered around easily. But she claims that it's food and rotten stuff there, which cause the smell. 

She also moved her desk in a way that is very uncomfortable for me. Normally they're placed one next to the other, facing the same way. The room is small, this is important. Last week she turned it 90¬∞, so now I have to move to the left of my desk if she wants to pull out her chair. I told her it's not okay for me and she should move it back, because I don't want to have to move to make her space when the room wasn't designed like this. She said that this is how she wants to stay. 

A huge, huge problem is the number of alarms Em sets every morning. At least 6, ringing every 5 minutes for what seems like an eternity, until either it automatically snoozes or she decides to turn it off. Often when I have classes later in the day and want to sleep longer, her alarm will wake me up at 6 30, and I can't fall back asleep because of the constant stream of alarms. So far I've given up on trying to sleep and woke up, silently cursing her for ruining my sleep day after day. 

I don't get along extremely well with my roommates. They share some vices that I don't: they smoke, they go out clubbing, go out with boys every other night and drink. I don't condemn them, let them do what they want, it's only normal for me to be excluded if I don't share these activities with them. I'm just not that type of person. I've made my peace with it. However it seems to me that Em respects her friends/roommates, Laura and Deli, and keeps quiet when they're asleep or trying to study. She only acts like a jerk around me. 

The drop that filled my glass was last night. Em and Deli came in the room at 4 AM with a bunch of boys who seemed drunk as hell, laughing and talking very very very loudly. Me and Laura were asleep. Laura didn't say anything, but I was grumpy, tired and I told them to keep it down, that it's late and people are sleeping at this hour. Instead of quieting down, they started laughing louder and mocking me. After the boys left I confronted Em about it, telling her that it's not OK to bring people in at this hour, that it's impolite and rude to be this loud when roommates are sleeping and that I don't like what they're doing. Em got defensive and replied that I've also brought my boyfriend in the room and woke her up. Here's the difference: my boyfriend visited me at lunch/afternoon, and always made sure to keep quiet if someone was sleeping at that hour. That accusation and the laugh she had with Deli afterwards just killed it for me. 

I'm done having my sleep ruined by rude, disrespectful Em who doesn't give a shit if I'm sleeping/studying in the room. I want to have my rest, and the respect I deserve and that I treat her with. I'm careful when they're asleep, I'm mindful when they're studying. I'm considering going to the dorm administrator and placing a complaint against her, as well as a request to be moved from this room.

At the same time, I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable and I should adapt to this new lifestyle and tolerate her. Reddit, a word of advice here?

Edit: TL;DR: Roommate has asshole behaviors that disturb my sleep and my study time, as well as generally being rude. This includes loud talking at 3 AM and 20 alarms every morning. I've reached the end of my patience.",relationship_advice
t3_dlqac3,How to help my(31M) girlfriend(25F) after she...cheated on me? (SERIOUS),"Ok this may sounds very ridiculous to some of you, but please guys/girls I am not here for criticism. 
I consider myself as a conscious man, I know the risks, I know that she betrayed my feelings and so on. Of course I will not forgive her again. Never. Period.

But the fact is that I love her and I strongly believe that things can work nice for as again.

Btw, after the affair and her confession (she was painfully honest) she is feeling extremely guilty, shame and sadness. She treats me very well, but she cannot express her feelings like before because of these bad feelings. Even when we laugh I can see the guilty in her eyes. These feelings make the process of healing even more hard.

Also, i try not be the guy who always blames her about this. I took the hard decision to be with her and I want to support her(sounds crazy but it is not)

So redditors what can I do for her in order to make her feel more comfortable for what she did? any thoughts?

t3_dlq1zw,Girlfriend of one year sent nudes to close friend,"My girlfriend( F16) of over a year just told me(F16) that a month before her and I got together, she sent nudes to a close friend of ours (M17). 

It was about two months after she ended her long term 3 year long relationship and she was feeling desperate and lonely, so she texted him (my girlfriend is a lesbian). 

She sent him nudes, and they planned on having sex, but it never happened. 

This friend of ours is really really close to us. He was my ""fake date"" to homecoming just last weekend (unsupportive parents). He hangs out with us constantly. It hurts that I'm just now finding out that he's seen my girlfriends body.

My girlfriend and I were close friends for years beforehand and she told me that she's liked me for as long as she can remember, so part of me feels weird because she didn't turn to me...

I feel like I'm over reacting. It was over a year ago, my girlfriend doesn't even like men, and her and I weren't even together. But it still just makes me feel really weird and uncomfortable and hurt. Am I overreacting?? How do I stop feeling like this?

And if someone were to ask me to talk to her about it... what would I even say?? Because she doesn't seem to think it's a big deal at all, she brought it up very casually.

t3_dlrmaa,I'm sort of a secret girlfriend.. (Sorry for the super long post),"So, my boyfriend [20M] and I [19F] have been dating for almost 6 months now. When we first began dating I was kept a secret from everyone because his close friends hate me (yes, hate is a strong word, but that's the case here), they know me from when we all went to high school together. Less than a month in we told our mutual friends and he told his parents and brother about me (I had already told my mum about the relationship). We are not coming up on 6 months together and he still hasn't told his close friends about us, or even mentioned that he has a girlfriend. At first I didn't think it was a big deal, because it didn't start off all that serious, but things got serious and intense very quickly. There have been multiple times where it has come up in conversation, and he has simply said he would tell them when they're ready (myself and several mutual friends both believe his close friends will never be ""ready"") He and I both know that if he tells his friends, they will make him choose between them and us. I tried to break up with him because of it once, because I knew that if they made him choose, and he chose me he would grow to resent me for it. We've had several fights/disagreements about it. Our most recent fight I told him how I felt (that this wasn't a serious relationship to him which is why he still hasn't told his friends, that I'm not good enough for him in relation to his friends, that he hasn't told them because he plans on leaving before he ever has to tell them, etc.) I suggested telling everyone that we broke up, and then continue to date in secret, because there is a very large possibility that someone we hang out with may let our relationship slip to the wrong person and it would get back to his close friends, and they would be even more angry that he lied to them and tried to hide it. He told me not to be ridiculous, and said he would tell his friends. I made him promise not to, because I already know what will happen if he does. And he asked if I was okay with it, and I said yes (I lied, but he has no idea despite the fact that we have had several fights over it now). He said okay and told me to tell him if it ever did start to bother me (which I can't exactly do, because every time I do bring it up, he gets upset, and says he'll tell his friends when they're ready) 

I'm not sure how to move forward from here..

t3_dlrld1,Partner (29M) got one of his extended family to shave his head. Surprise to me when him &amp; I (27F) had discussed us doing together as was a big thing. Am I overreacting?,"Throwaway as detail is a bit of a giveaway.

So long term partner (5yrs) has had thinning hair and been receding for a while and talked about shaving his head at some point but ummed and ahhed. Quite a symbolic big move for him, having had long hair for years prior. He has quite a distinct shaped head/facial profile so it also would look VERY different.

His mum (who he lives with) and grandmother were very much against this whenever he deliberated the idea.

He bought the razor and when shaving off came up in conversation with Mum I declined taking sides but said I was used to his hair. In retrospect BF says I should have 'supported him rather than sided with his mum'. my view is  and I said to him was it's your head, do what you want. Not my place to argue over it with MIL?

He's been talking about taking the plunge for years and how I'd help him shave it initially, we were about to on Sunday but I suggested it might be a good idea to 'prep' his mum and we could do it together later in the week.

So I come back from work today, he messages me that he needs 'help evening out his hair after brother in law cut it'. There's nothing to thin out, it's all shaved off.

I felt weirdly  hurt as it was a big symbolic thing we were going to do together and he's gone and asked extended family to do it with NO warning. No meetings at work or functions to prep for, just did it whilst I was at work. 

When I was a bit down about it he got annoyed and said I wasn't being supportive and was a negative influence. That he gave me the chance at the weekend but 'unlike his sister and BIL I didn't have the balls to stand up to his mums view'. I dont know why the sister needs to endorse it really.

A few years ago, I was sexually assaulted by Pete. I felt disgusted and shameful. I was afraid of telling my sister.

t3_dlrix6,I don't know whether I should pursue a girl...,"Obligatory Throwaway account because all my mates follow my main reddit account. English is not my native language, so excuse the awkward phrasing.

Anyway, me and this girl both go to the same university. We live in the same flat and see each other on a daily basis. We study the same subjects and have many overlapping lectures throughout the week. We get along well.

When I first met her around a month and a half ago, I really did not think much of it. I had just gotten out of a 2-year relationship with my ex, who had proven to be extremely selfish. Truth be told, the prospect of even doing anything with a girl was not even in my mind at that point, since starting Uni was an equally exciting and daunting event in my life. Since then I have grown quite fond of her. I normally wouldn't worry about this because I think I should let things take their course. 

However, she is desperate about getting a boyfriend. By her own admission, she feels lonely, so she probably feels a boyfriend would help fill that void. It is literally the main motivation she has to go outside partying with our group. Me and some of her other friends have had to take her away from clubs multiple times because she attracts the wrong type of attention from guys that are way too creepy (We've literally been followed back home by a 30-year+ old guy, who attempted to break into the common area of our flat with a crowbar). I can get a bit wild when I've had a bit too much to drink, but she gets drunk with the express purpose of getting with a random guy for the night, and taking it from there. (By get, I mean make out. As far as I can tell, she hasn't had sex with anyone just yet).

I don't know whether I should pursue her in the long run. I feel like she is a great girl and that getting together would be great. If it isn't meant to be, then that's also perfectly fine. A lot of my flatmates jokingly suggest that we should be a couple behind her back, and I always disregard their comments as teasing, but its gotten to the point where I've started thinking. I feel like she might deserve better, and that at the moment she is just confused. I've had many oppurtunities to make a move when we were both drunk, but every time I stop myself because I think I would be taking advantage of her. I don't want to start any relationship, even if it is just a casual fling, by taking advantage of someone's moment of weakness. I think that is wrong.

t3_dlrhrr,My (24F) BFF's (24F) new boyfriend (35M) is showing major red flags. How do I show her without ruining our friendship?,"My best friend (A) hasn't had the best of luck with relationships. She jumped from abusive ex to abusive ex and finally, a few years ago, became single and started to learn how to love herself and be independent. She's been with other partners since her relationships, but never in more than a casual dating type of way. These guys weren't necessarily the best, but I believe everyone has their flaws and she was super great at cutting them off when she didn't like the direction the relationship was going or they did a big oopsie (she's grown a lot in that aspect and I'm so proud of her). 

We live really far away from each other now so I don't get to see her much in person or meet these men, I just get the stories. Today we FaceTime and she started telling me about this new guy (J) who she called her boyfriend. I thought that was weird because we'd just spoken not even 2 weeks ago and I'd never heard of the guy. She said they just met online. When I questioned why things were moving so fast, she just said it was because J was older and that's just where he was at this point in his life. She starts talking about how he's really goal oriented and everything she has been looking for in a man and then starts getting upset with me when I ask her for examples of these traits (ex: what about him makes you say he's goal orientated? And she seems unable to come up with an answer).  As she goes on she tells me a story about how they got in a small argument (my friend was upset over something not related to J and just not in a good mood but he took it as a sign she was angry with him) and when they got to the bar they were having dinner at, J pounded 6 beers and started talking about how sad A looked and how everyone in the bar was looking at her and thinking that she was upset with him (ok fucking weirdo). He remained upset about this until they went back to A's apartment where they had sex. Immediately afterwards, J is trying to get dressed talking about how A clearly doesn't want him there after how she treated him earlier in the day. 

This story immediately screams ""red flag"" to me  and after a few more questions A starts opening up more about J. The first time they met, they hung out for a bit during the day, then they left the date and A went to have dinner with her sister, J texted her during dinner and asked if he could see her again later that night (he had seen her literally 3 hours ago. Also J lives a 45 min drive away).Apparently he's already been asking her about moving in with him (again, they've known each other less than 2 weeks). He's been making her feel guilty for having male friends (including her roommate and a close friend she's had for at least half a decade that has strictly been platonic). Then to top it off, dude has been saying it's strange for her to want to spend time apart from him. 

At this point I'm thinking this guy is full on nuts, I make a joke about how J sounds like the type of guy to chain someone in his basement. A laughs but I can tell she's not really feeling me making fun of this guy. She goes on by saying that he's just much older than her and is at a different point in his life which is why he's acting this way (which is strange because he's acting like a 14 year old kid in my eyes). I believe she's making excuses for him because she is a little insecure in not having her life together yet while he does and a slight power dynamic that causes her to think she doesn't deserve a significant other like that. I give up on trying to call out red flags and telling her this guy is one big ""hell fucking no"" and try to offer some real advice. I tell her she need to focus on positive reinforcement, since he goes into a full blown pity party anytime she acknowledges his bad behavior. I said that she should tell him ""hey I really enjoy spending time with you, but I can't miss you when I'm with you all the time. Sometimes I just need a second to focus on myself and get excited for when I see you next. I really appreciate when you understand that I need my alone time to get prepared for the week and make sure all my stuff is taken care of."" Make him focus on how he should be acting towards her if he really wants to make her happy. So we end the FaceTime with her promising she's going to keep me updated with how he responds. The following are the texts:

J: ""I already know what this means when your girl tells you she needs space and it's nothing good it's basically the beginning of the end.""

A: ""In order for fires to burn they need oxygen or you'll suffocate it and the flames will go out.""

J: ""All these metaphors are nice but I get the message. I'm giving you your space, taking a giant step back. We will see if it's beneficial.""

J: ""I don't need space. I need a woman to love me 24/7.""

To me it seems like he needs a woman he can guilt trip 24/7 because he's a fucking loser. I'm just at a loss for how to respond, A and I have grown distant before because I didn't think she was dating a very good guy (who ended up being physically abusive) and I'm worried she would let our friendship drift again if I push too hard on this dude being crazy. I'm not sure what to do to help her see the light. No matter what way I look at it, guy seems like bad news.

TL;DR: best friend in a brand new relationship with a guy who is guilt tripping her into: never getting upset, not having male friends, moving in with him (after 2 weeks), and not being able to have alone time.",relationship_advice

t3_dlrf5s,Considering breaking my co-worker rule,"This is a bit of a novel, so sorry in advanceüò¨ TL;DR at the end.

I started working at a new company almost 5 months ago and I felt like it took me awhile to feel comfortable there. I'm pretty introverted and I work in a department with a lot of extroverts. The guy in question works in the same department that I do, but I don't really work with him directly but we do share an open office space so I see him a lot throughout the day. I've always had a hard rule against dating co-workers and it's never been an issue until now.  The first couple of months, I didn't really pay him much attention.  He's outgoing and attractive but I just kept to myself and thought nothing of it. I had never even talked to him until nearly 4 months into working there.  

About two months into the job, I actually had a dream with him in it (lol which was super weird considering we had never had a conversation before). In the dream we were interested in each other but neither one of us wanted to take the step to actually confess our feelings. The dream ended when I got a message from him saying that it was clear we liked each other so why not just go for it. My dream self was like ""hell yeah, get it girl"" and we started dating.  But when I woke up, I was *very* confused. For a couple of weeks after the dream I felt kinda weird around him, but still hadn't spoken to him. Fast forward about a month later, and things are back to normal, I didn't think much of it and had mostly forgotten about the dream.

Then last month, I noticed a shift in things.  He complimented my outfit one day and the week following that, I noticed he went out of his way more to come by my desk or it seemed he'd go out of his way to talk to me and joke around with me.  During a span of a week and a half, I started noticing him more: what his interests were, how he was well liked in the department.  We had a lot more similarities than I thought and he was fun to talk to despite my growing nerves around him.  Before I knew it, I had caught feelings. 

I went on a trip for nearly two weeks after all these interactions and during that time we followed each other  on social media.  It's been three weeks since getting back from my trip and I'm kind of at a lost on what to do. 

I know I get really nervous around him sometimes (or all the time haha) and being in a work environment when our other coworkers are constantly around is hard.  I don't feel like I can fully flirt and be myself; almost like I'm under a microscope and I don't want my other co-workers being suspicious. We have good moments of flirting (as much as you can get away with in a corporate office) and we talk occasionally outside of work on Instagram. But I noticed he's not great at carrying on a conversation on there, though he often initiates them.  There are signs that he's interested: if our other co-workers aren't around at the end of the day, he'll wait around for me and we'll walk out of the office together, I catch him watching me often, he'll compliment me but seems a bit nervous around me at the same time, he says flirty things that I have never heard him say to other female co-workers.  

He's pretty extroverted, but I wonder if he has the same hesitations that I do.  Because of my hesitations, I feel as though I come off as uninterested at times when I'm just trying to be nonchalant.  To be honest, I feel as though I'm living out my dream in real time now and I'm too unsure to move forward.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR- two months into a new job, I had a dream my coworker and I were interested in each other and started dating despite never talking to each other. About three months later, we started talking and I've noticed signs of interest on his end and I'm now interested, just unsure how to move forward with things given my previous rule against dating co-workers.",relationship_advice
t3_dlkyii,I (M27) have just been told she (F24) wants to stop dating. I‚Äôm genuinely crushed about it.,"We‚Äôve been dating for a good few months and it‚Äôs been going perfect, we‚Äôve even mentioned the future about plans etc and that we would make a great couple. 

To make this short as possible, rewind to last Sunday we went on a date, best date by far. Was amazing, she said it was the best she‚Äôs ever been on. 
I seen her again Monday evening and this is where it went downhill. Her texts were getting less frequent, it just seemed off to me and my gut was telling me something was wrong. I ignored my gut and thought this would pass. 
Throughout the week it was still there and i began to worry. 
We arranged to see each other Saturday night just gone, we enjoyed ourselves but she didn‚Äôt seem herself from the get go. Was quieter than usual, less touchy with me and overall less chatty. I thought it was because she was shattered, she had a really long day in work so I put it down to that. 
We end the night back at hers, still acting the same, I leave and let her get some sleep. We keep kissing and have a fairly lengthy hug and she asks when am I seeing her next, I said I‚Äôll sort it out. I drive home. 

On my drive home I‚Äôm constantly feeling this gut feeling that it‚Äôs wrong she‚Äôs behaving weird with me so I text her Sunday evening. 
Worst news came back, she said my feelings were right. She just started seeing differences in our personalities etc and said although they was good it was different levels. No idea what she means by that but fair enough I take it. She said her mind was mashed over this and thought it was her being stupid, she said she wanted to see me on the date we had Saturday to see if her feelings would change. She said they didn‚Äôt. Something has changed in her head and she doesn‚Äôt understand it, she said she‚Äôs not 100% and I understand you shouldn‚Äôt follow a relationship if your not 100%. Her exact words were ‚Äúrelationships should be 100% or nothing. Seeing you Saturday didn‚Äôt change that and it hurts to say that‚Äù. I accepted it but I‚Äôm crushed. 

We‚Äôve had our take care texts I don‚Äôt think she will reply back to my last one I presume it‚Äôs done.
I‚Äôm so upset over this, I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend because I was developing really strong feelings towards her, she was the most exciting girl I‚Äôve ever been around. 
I tried to focus my attention on things I enjoy such as the gym and that even feels a chore now. I had such a crap workout I couldn‚Äôt focus, all that has been on my mind is her, whys? And what ifs?

Did I fall in love!? It‚Äôs such a short time for it to happen I imagine but I feel sick. I can‚Äôt really eat and I actually cried twice over this. 
I just want to drive to her house and fix it but i won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs done I won‚Äôt contact her again. The thought of moving on to meet another girl actually scares me. I wanted her and her only. 

I told her how I feel and she already knew I was having strong feelings for her we spoke about it a few weeks ago and she agreed she was having the same feelings, she said she was expecting a relationship to come of this but why after a few months can your mind change!? 

I treated her amazing in her words ‚Äúyou‚Äôve treated me better than I ever could have imagined, I feel lucky to have even ever dated you. Your the nicest lad I actually know‚Äù. 

I just don‚Äôt understand, my mind is going a million miles per hour and I can‚Äôt stop looking at her social media. I‚Äôm just waiting for this imaginary text to say she wants to try and make this work now her head has cleared. 

This is embarrassing because it‚Äôs only been a few months but I can‚Äôt help how I feel, has this happened to anyone else?

t3_dlpo96,I (F16) has a mother (F35) who constantly tears me down,"I‚Äôm just going to get right into this

I‚Äôm going to start off by saying my mother , other than the fact that she‚Äôs an asshole at times , is an amazing person. She would go to great lengths for my siblings and I and I appreciate all she has done for me. 

But to be quite frank, I‚Äôm done with her bullshit. What she said to me today was the last straw. 

My mam always makes comments about me that aren‚Äôt nice whatsoever. She likes to take the piss all the time and constantly picks on me. She always looks for something to give out about. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt look the way she wished I did. I‚Äôm not exactly the skinniest, I have stretch marks on my arms and a few on my hips, a few scars from a wild but amazing childhood that are visible and I don‚Äôt have a big bum , which to her seems like a massive issue. I‚Äôm trying to love myself but she always tears me down. 

She makes jokes about me to her friends and then LAUGHS with her friends about it , she says things that cause me to not feel comfortable enough to wear a SHIRT at home , she constantly compares my body to hers when she was a teenager because apparently she used to be perfect and of course compares me to my friends. she pretty much tells me I‚Äôm ugly all day every day. I cannot do anything without being judged. My dad is no better either.

Because of the way my mam treats me , my siblings think it‚Äôs okay to say those things to me too and they‚Äôre all younger than me. It‚Äôs one thing to hear it from mam and dad but when the whole family is bad mouthing you , it‚Äôs so difficult to ignore it. 

Today , I walked into the kitchen to make a cup of tea because I had a sore throat and needed something hot and she just decides to say ‚Äúwith those stretch marks on your arms and stomach *shakes head* when you get married , your husband is going to see them and say what the fuck did I marry ?‚Äù and then she laughed. 

My mental heath was already in a bad place so it was.
So I turned off the kettle , took a Strepsil from the cupboard and went upstairs. I went into my room and just thought ‚Äú what the actual hell‚Äù to myself. my mam has said lots of things to me , but this was an all time low. Why would she say that out of nowhere? She‚Äôs going to drive me to suicide. I‚Äôve been trying to better myself for a while now and she just made me feel like it wasn‚Äôt worth it at all. I realised the reason I never got with any lads was because of the things she said. She made me paranoid and scared of being judged the way she judged me. Home is such a toxic environment. I hate it here. I can‚Äôt be myself , I can‚Äôt love myself and I can‚Äôt do things for myself. I‚Äôm always the bad guy. I know I‚Äôm just rumbling on but I‚Äôm just a mess. 

I need to get out of here. Where should I go? I‚Äôm not contacting socials. I just need to leave. I know it might sound dramatic but I‚Äôve been dealing with this since 8yrs old. It‚Äôs damaged me too much mentally. People have it worse , I know. But my situation should be taken just as serious. 

Any advice on what to do ? Speaking to my parents about how they‚Äôre treating me won‚Äôt do anything for me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlervx,"My bf(30m) suggested threesome, now I(25f) want to explore my sexuality.","First of all, I want to say I'm truly thankful for all the people who gave me advice on my last post - I read through all the comments and they're all very helpful. (Btw here's the [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dff1v5/nsfw_my_bf_wants_to_watch_me_sleep_with_other_men/) )

Long story short, I gave it bit research and found out that IT IS a common kink/sexual fantasy - so no need to freak out, I just need to make sure there's no porn addiction issue with my bf. 

Last week I sat down and talked to him. It was a very calm and non-judgemental conversation, where my bf apologized for freaking me out and then told me that he never wanted to cheat, that he's not gay or bi, it's just that he found the idea of seeing me have sex with someone else(could be either a guy or a girl) WHILE he's there very, very hot. He also reassured me that he doesn't have a porn addiction. From my previous observation for the past 6 months, I don't think he's obsessed with porn either. So after all, it's a harmless sexual fantasy of his, is all. Then my bf went on saying that it's ok for me to find the idea disgusting and not willing to participate. I told him that it's totally fine to have fantasies like this and I respect that - we can explore things together as long as it's consensual; that I'm not down for a threesome YET but I'm not 100% opposed to the idea and given time it might grow on me.

My bf was really happy about it and said that I can take my time to think this through, and if I ever want to willingly do this we can have another talk - also I can get to choose if the third party is male or female, a total stranger or someone we know. 

Now it's been a few days since our last conversation. Although my bf didn't bring up the topic again, I myself can't stop thinking about it. I watched a few porns about threesomes, 2guys1girl, as well 2girls1guy. Much to my surprise I was WAY more aroused by the latter one, especially when I saw the actions between the two girls. I then moved on to watch a few lesbian porns.. Well what can I say -I liked them too. 

I grew up in a conservative Asian family and I have never seen myself as anything other than a straight woman for the past 25 years of my life. I've dated only male and I do believe I'm attracted to men. Now I am not so sure.

A little part of me wants to use the threesome as an opportunity to explore my sexuality. I can make out with a girl to see if I actually enjoy it. Would it be unfair for my bf? Should I talk to him about this uncertain sexuality thing first? What if it turns out that I AM bisexual? 

This is a great relationship that I don't want to risk, but the idea is now stuck in my mind...

t3_dlr8d2,My (F21) boyfriend (M30) gave me a birthday present,"My boyfriend is the kindest human being. We‚Äôve been together for about two years now, we live together, have talked about marriage and kids, this is my person and I want to spend my life with him and only him.

I‚Äôll buy him anything and everything and the same isn‚Äôt really reciprocated but I‚Äôm okay with that because my love is just so grand for this man where I don‚Äôt think twice about my purchases. 

My birthday is in two weeks and I have been curious as to what we are doing that day and I can‚Äôt wait for it.

My only response was well if I open it now the day of my birthday I will not look forward to open anything. Let‚Äôs save the surprise for my birthday!‚Äù He then disregarded that comment and opened it and showed me and to my surprise it‚Äôs a case for my phone. It‚Äôs a pink case. I of course exclaimed how cute it is and how much I loved it. I had thanked him and hugged him. 

Deep down I really feel like there‚Äôs no thought in this birthday gift. And if there was thought, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but thought means wrapping it up in something cute like a gift bag maybe some tissue paper to show effort no matter what the gift is. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is effort and I‚Äôm not finding it. 

I told my best friend about this and she said that I‚Äôm shallow and how a gift is meaningful no matter what it is and you know maybe that‚Äôs right.

Sometimes I feel like he‚Äôs flirting with me when we talk, but that could just be in my head. There are other couples at my job and there was one that was similar(same position as me and him) as me and this supervisor but they were married before they started working so not really the same. Should I even attempt to actually make an effort into flirting to see if something is there or no because of how inappropriate it is? I don‚Äôt think either of us would lose our job, but with my job it could put our primary(and secondary) customers at risk. He is in charge of how the product is made and I make sure the product is good enough for our customers, if it isn‚Äôt, then we essentially lose money as a whole. I don‚Äôt know exactly what all happens when a supervisors product is consistently not up to standards but I probably put the product ‚Äúout of grade‚Äù the most in my department. We run 4-5 different types of product at the same time and we have different supervisors for each respective product.

t3_dlpct3,My friend got a new boyfriend and has gone MIA,"I am (20f) and my friend is (19f). We have been friends since middle school. We were both apart of the same big group of friends all through out middle to high school and during her sophomore year she got a boyfriend who she dated for 3 years. At first she still came around and hung out with everyone and her boyfriend would hang out too but then slowly as time went on she started to become more and more distant. She also had a falling out with one of the girls in our friend group and never came around much after that and only sat with us at lunch and would associate with us at school but rarely ever outside of school. Anytime I would ask her to hang out or anyone would include her in plans she never answered or had an excuse or said that her boyfriend didn‚Äôt want to go so she didn‚Äôt want to. So the last two years of me being in high school with her I wasn‚Äôt very close to her and didn‚Äôt have much of a relationship with her outside of school.  

Fast forward to last year her boyfriend and her broke up once she went off to college, she then started to come out of her shell more and actually was wanting to do things and was putting herself out there to reconnect with some of her friends including me. Her and I were able to get really close again and had a much better relationship. She even vented to me that she was happy that she ended the relationship because she was actually able to be free and do her thing and not miss out on spending time with friends, she even acknowledged the fact that she would just sit at her boyfriends house all day and not do anything and that she followed everything he did. I was so proud of her for realizing that and actually wanting to break from those habits and find herself, she was doing so well and was really thriving. Everytime we hung out she always was so much fun and we always had the best time, she also was a really good friend to me and always let me know that she was there for me and that she loved me. 

Fast forward to this past summer she met a guy one night when her and I went out and things between them moved pretty fast two weeks into them knowing each other he was already staying the night at her house and they started hanging out with each other everyday. 3 weeks into them getting to know each other they made it official. I wasn‚Äôt ever able to go to her house or spend time with her without him having to be there too. Her mood also changed as well she went from being super optimistic and wanting to go and do everything to not wanting to do anything and always being in a bad mood. She also went from texting me everyday and always wanting to hang out to barley even speaking to me. It started to really annoy me and I tried my best to be happy for her cause he‚Äôs a good guy but I just felt like things were moving so fast paced and that I was kind of being put on the back burner. They both also go to colleges that are within like a hour from each other so they‚Äôre constantly going back and forth to each other‚Äôs schools and they both come home and visit every weekend and only hang with each other, she doesn‚Äôt ever have the decency to tell me that she‚Äôs in town I always have to find out later on when I‚Äôm on Snapchat. 

I just feel like she‚Äôs back to square 1 with exactly how she was with her first boyfriend and it‚Äôs like when she‚Äôs dating someone she makes that person her only priority and doesn‚Äôt have time for friends anymore. It‚Äôs like pulling teeth to get her to even go to lunch with you and she always has some sort of excuse. I just don‚Äôt understand what it is and I‚Äôve just stopped trying because I‚Äôm honestly hurt.",relationship_advice
t3_dlr4jt,Sometimes I (26M) don't have anything new to say to my long distance GF (25F). How can I stay in touch better?,"So some background: we started dating a few years ago when we lived in the same city, but a few months into that she got a job that took her across the country. So, since we had only been together for a few months anyway we decided to call it quits with no hard feelings and stayed in touch. Eventually though I ended up developing some real feelings for her; and when I told her how I felt she told me that she felt the same way. So I started visiting her every other month or so and we decided to make it a long distance thing until I finish school and can move. Conservatively speaking I probably won't be able to move until June so we still have a few months to go; and to make up for it we try to spend a lot of time on the phone, but to be honest I just run out of things to say sometimes. It was fine for awhile but after I really buckled down my life is basically 50% school and 50% work so there's not much new things going on. I'm happy to hear about how her life is going but I feel bad anytime I have to just say ""same old, same old"" whenever she asks me the same. We usually call each other 3 times a week but I know she'd like more than that. Anyone have experience with long distance? How do you keep it fresh without seeing each other?",relationship_advice
t3_dl3q0c,My husband (m25) cheated on me (f24) a year ago. I decided to stay. He‚Äôs done a 180 and is everything I ever needed before. But does this pain ever end?,"I apologize in advance if my grammar isn‚Äôt on point. 
My husband cheated on me with his ex wife about a year ago. I was pregnant at the time. His ex wife reached out to me and told me everything in detail. For the first few months he lied to me about absolutely everything. He did this thing called tickle truth where he would say only part of the truth but lie. He finally admitted everything to me when I would over analyze and break it down to him how his story wouldn‚Äôt make sense. I decided to try to forgive him and stay because I was very deeply in love with him and he was showing remorse. I also have a daughter with him and I wanted her to not have a broken household. My husband has done a complete 180. He‚Äôs being the best husband he can be and the best father. He‚Äôs the most affectionate he‚Äôs ever been, he‚Äôs been working on building that trust with me, and he is so so good  with our daughter. He‚Äôs doing everything he can to save our marriage and family but it‚Äôs just me. I still haven‚Äôt forgiven him. I think about what he did daily. It‚Äôs very hard to believe in him and trust him when he lied to me for so long. My self esteem is on the floor. When he tries to make love to me, I imagine him and his ex wife. I constantly compare myself to her. It‚Äôs always in my head. I feel hate for him at times.. but then there‚Äôs moments I feel a love for him. I feel so confused and conflicted. I want him and I love him. Yet I want to be away from him as well. I know I‚Äôll get shit for staying... but does this ever get better? Is there hope that our marriage can flourish or am I wasting years away?",relationship_advice
t3_dlr3xp,"I(22f) am stuck in a casual relationship, which I want to make exclusive (but afraid to do that)","Recently got out of a long term relationship with a person I thought I‚Äôd marry. Met someone very shortly after that, we hit it off; both sort of decided that we will be simultaneously seeing other people. 

Once month in, I discover that he is actually actively going on dates. We talk about it, he handles it very well and calls me down. I see other people. Two months in, I realize that other people don‚Äôt really do it for me. For him, it still seems to be going well (from the looks of it). 

The situation reached its peak last week when his phone broke, and he didn‚Äôt get back to me about our weekend plans for about a day. In my head, I overthought it to the point where I thought that he went on a date, which went really well and he stayed over someone else‚Äôs apartment (he used to put his phone on airplane mode when we first started seeing each other, and would leave it like that for hours). That turned out not to be the case, but made me realize how much I actually care about what‚Äôs going on between us. 

Our relationship doesn‚Äôt revolve around sex. We still go on dates, take walks in the evening, text throughout the week. Recently he started asking me to stay over (I live very close). We have a good connection, and everything seems to be going well all in all. 

This relationship was supposed to be fun and carefree, but I realize I am too invested to the point where I get hurt thinking about him sleeping with other women. Or even being interested in them. I am afraid that if I bring it up, and say that I don‚Äôt really want to stay casual anymore, he will end things. 

How should I approach it? Should I even mention it or let things take its course? What would you do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlr2ny,"Females that I fall for don't like me, but the girls I don't like fall for me?","I'll attempt to keep this as simple as possible. I am a 29 year old man, I have a stable job, a budding career, my own house and I keep myself in really great shape. I love being me, and I'm completely content with the person that I am. I have allot going for me right now. 

I'm here because the one area that I struggle with is my dating life. Not that I struggle to find dates, or even the general lack of female attention. My problem seems to be much more psychological than I even know. When I was 24 years old I fell in love with a beautiful young woman, and we ended up getting close to engaged. Yet, one thing lead to another and she ended up leaving me. Didn't give me a reason as to why, or even the courtesy of letting me know that what we had was over. I spent around 2 years in a state of utter misery, and wasted allot of my time. 

This all changed in 2017 when I met a girl, we started talking, and eventually started dating. It was fine, she was fun to hang out with and decent company. Over time though I began to realize that I didn't want to be with her. All the while she was falling head over heals in love with me. Fawning over me, and planning out our lives together. It was around a year and half into our relationship when anther young girl came into my life. Nothing happened with this girl, I never cheated with her, and I continued to date my current girlfriend even though my heart told me differently.  Eventually I had enough and broke things off with the first girl. I waited a few weeks and started casually dating this other girl. Funny story, the same exact thing happened as before.I realized the girl wasn't right for me and after a year I decided it was time to end things with her. All while this girl fell head over heals in love with me, started planning out lives together and couldn't see herself with any other guy. 

This brings us to current day. Currently, I am dating a new girl whom I am head over heels in love with, yet I get the feeling that she doesn't feel quite the same way as i do. I can hardly go a period of time without thinking about her, and I am constantly worried and nervous she will end things with me. I have even thought about just ending things with her because I can't handle the anticipation of her breaking up with me. It's not like she has ever really given me any strong inclinations that something may be wrong but I just feel like it might end. I don't know if its paranoia or if there is something there?

I gues my question is, why does it seem that the girls that I don't really care for end up falling madly in love with me, I could do the worst things to them (I didn't) and they wouldn't even care, as long as I stayed in their lives. There have been two now, two that I didn't really care for and both of them fell head over heals in love with me. Yet these two other girls, whom I fall deeply in love with......just don't have the same connection as I do. I'm just so utterly confused and it seems like I can't hit the mark. Is there some subliminal mental blockage that I'm missing?",relationship_advice

I talked to her about it, and she said she was still interested in me, but wanted to take things slow all the sudden, but I was fine with it because I really like her. She got even more distant and I talked to her about it a week later. Same answer, only after that she would ignore me or give me one word answers. I've been avoiding her and giving her space and it seems to be helping some.

t3_dlqzbw,My (20F) boyfriends (21M) dick is kinda small. Is this a big deal?,"Soooo I‚Äôm a virgin, my boyfriend isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve watched porn before which I know is nothing like real sex but I have some knowledge I guess, I‚Äôm not completely clueless. He never really mentioned anything about his dick size before like he wasn‚Äôt like oh it‚Äôs so big it‚Äôs huge and he never said it was small or anything. 

Anyway we still didn‚Äôt have sex, but today I gave him a handjob /blowjob. Kind of late but he never pressured me or asked for anything so we kind of took things really slow. (Unrelated but he‚Äôs very generous, he‚Äòs also the first guy who went down on me and whoaaaa you guys. lol) Anyway so we started and he was kind of smaller than I‚Äôve seen in porn. I didn‚Äôt say anything about it and I just told him that I was nervous and excited because I was lol and he was really sweet. It was maybe like 3 or 4 inches? I‚Äôm not really good with measurements. But it was like I wrapped my hand around it and I couldn‚Äôt really move it up and down like I‚Äôve seen in porn since there was nothing else. If that makes sense. So that was a bit confusing since I didn‚Äôt know what to do lol 

But anyway this is kind of weird to ask, but is it possible to have sex with him even if he‚Äôs small or will it not go in?? Another thing is that idk a ton of girls always talk about dick size and like that‚Äôs a requirement. Is that true?? Like is it a big deal like that?? He‚Äôs a great boyfriend and I wouldn‚Äôt break up over sex/dick size but I‚Äôm just wondering is it something most girls would see as a deal breaker?",relationship_advice

I was secretive about my smoking and I never told anyone about it.

This new girl is one of my first relationships, and the first woman I‚Äôve slept with. She‚Äôs made me happier than I‚Äôve been in a long time, and I believe I make her happy too. Shortly after we started going out I quit smoking pot, happiness and sex are surprisingly good motivators.

t3_dlqyov,Someone spread rumours about me in my new job and I think I'm going to quit,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, so let me know if it's not and I'll remove it.

I started a retail job recently enough and have been working my ass off, I have bruises literally all over my body from the amount of hard work I put in (also I bruise very easily).  I've always been a hard worker, always have and always will make sure I do everything I can to complete a task to the best of my abilities.

I'm extremely shy, and have extreme social anxiety, so getting this job was a big step for me, and I rarely spoke to anyone, let alone complain.  I just want in, did my job and came home.

I walked into work the other day and a manager asked to speak to me and said someone spoke to him about me and stuff I've been saying. It was all a bunch of lies, saying I complained that one of my managers is gay, how the managers are horrible and unapproachable (I kept to myself, and therefore did not know enough to comment on anyone's traits, and even if I did, I would never say such things) and a bunch of other stuff.

So yeah.. I'm thinking of quitting because of it, because it's playing havock on my depression and anxiety and especially because when I explained to the manager that I would never say anything like that, and basically just explained that I'm a very shy person and would never ever say or do anything to hurt a person, it didn't seem like he believed me.

I have a strong feeling I know who made up the rumours about me, and the reason I think it's this person is because they are constantly saying that stuff to me, so I have a feeling they said I was the one saying it because they were scared I would say something, but I don't know. 

I haven't been in work since it happened, and I can feel myself reverting back into my depressive and anxious state, which I have just recently started learning to deal with.

What do you think? Should I quit?",relationship_advice

t3_dlqwzq,My (25F) girlfriend wanted a break with me (27M),"Hello! My ex girlfriend at the time was dating me for about 9 months when she told me in person that she was not happy with anything in life because of her depression, including our relationship, and wanted to take a break for a few months at the beginning of October. I told her why do we need a break and why can we not work on it together but she seemed so confused in her decision. Then I brought up the promise ring I had gotten for her a few months into our relationship and she asked if she could return it. I told her it sounds like she doesn't want to take a break but to actually break up but she insisted that she just needed some time to herself mostly because of the depression. I advised her to hide the ring or throw it away since it seemed like she was hinting more towards a breakup by asking if she could return the ring. Initially I went along with her taking a break stance on our relationship and agreed. She said by January she will let me know where she stands in life and our relationship. Two days later she texted me and told me that the past few days have been very hard on her and she wanted to apologize if her actions have ever hurt me before in my life. She was acting cold in the past few weeks leading up to the talk we had where she would randomly get upset at me in person over something completely not my fault or just act cold or distant, things that she believes were as a result of her depression. 

After four days of our talk, I decided that I do not want to sit idle for three months when there is always the chance that this break could just be a facade for a break up... so I texted her that we should go our separate ways and that this is taking a toll on me mentally already and that I love her and can't imagine if she tells me she doesn't want me in her life in January. I would have to heal twice. She agreed to break up. I advised her to seek therapy for her depression and she seemed very receptive to my advice.

Fast forward to approximately 10 days after she and I talked about taking a break, she texted me with some small talk banter after I tried to go no contact on her. Then she said ""btw I decided to seek help from a psychologist and you were the biggest reason as to why I did. Thank you for so being so understanding and amazing. Everytime I speak to the psychologist and almost everyday I wear the promise ring and looking at it makes me sooooo happy. I already feel mentally better after speaking to this psychologist."" She also asked about my mom and said she wanted to call my mom because she wanted to say hi to her but wasn't sure if my mom was told our relationship situation yet. My mom and her normally talk about twice a month on the phone and my ex gf told me during the ""lets take a break talk"" that she still wanted to talk to me and my mom no matter the outcome of the situation. 

As you could imagine, after reading her text message about the promise ring, I was so hurt. I don't know why she felt the need to bring up the fact that she wears my promise ring daily but a month before the breakup I noticed she stopped wearing it completely when I was around. Is she trying to mess with me by texting me this stuff? How should I proceed forward? I don't know what I am supposed to do if she texts me again or what her end goal is since we decided to break up. I also do not know if her depression is just a front for her true feelings of wanting to breakup...",relationship_advice
t3_dllnpk,My 10 year old daughter says she is a boy. Where do we go from here?,"Hi there. I‚Äôll try to make this as short and simple as I possibly can. 

My daughter is currently in 5th grade. She‚Äôs always been a super bubbly, energetic girl. She dresses like any other 10 year old girl and has a ton of friends.

About a year ago, my wife playfully asked our daughter if she liked any boys at school. She told her that she did not like boys like that. No big deal. A few months later, my daughter told my wife that she had a crush on one of her best friends at school, who happened to be a girl. We laughed it off at first, thinking that our daughter didn‚Äôt realize what a ‚Äòcrush‚Äô or ‚Äòbeing in love‚Äô was. 

However, she soon began making comments about how she wanted to kiss her friend and become her girlfriend. We both found it odd initially, but we came to the conclusion that had she been talking about a boy in the same sense, it would be considered ‚Äòharmless‚Äô and completely normal. We soon came to the conclusion that our daughter was gay. 

About a month back, my younger daughter, who is 6, told my wife that she saw her older sister going through our closet. She was trying on some of my clothes and spraying my cologne onto her body. At this point, my wife and I sat down for a serious talk. We wanted to figure out what was going on but at the same time we wanted to let our daughter ‚Äòexplore‚Äô without fully interfering. We mutually agreed that we would sit her down and talk about how it‚Äôs ok to be different and assure her that we would always support her. 

During that talk, my daughter reiterated that she was into girls and not boys. She then told us that she wants to become a boy. She told us that she began to question her gender 2 years ago. Through the internet, she found out what being transgender means. She told us it all made sense when she read about it. We both told her that we would absolutely go along with her transition if that was truly the way she felt. 

Over the next few weeks, my daughter has begun the ‚Äòtransition‚Äô already. She has slowly started dressing more masculine and told me she wants her hair cut short like mine. She has a very feminine first name, so she has asked if we could change it. As puberty looms, she has already told us that she wants reassignment surgery. Her breast have already started growing and she says it‚Äôs making her insecure. 

We told our daughter to take it slowly, but obviously she is ready to do this after years of confusion and silence in fear that we would go against her wishes. According to my daughter, she has told her friends that she is transitioning. She said most of them didn‚Äôt even know what that meant, but that they all thought it was ‚Äòcool‚Äô. She continues to have a massive crush on her friend and told us that she wants to ask her out on a date to the school dance in December. 

So...

Are we doing the right thing here? How long do I wait before consulting a doctor about a sex change operation? How do I tell my super religious, bigoted parents about this? Is it ok to feel sadness about ‚Äòlosing‚Äô my daughter even though I know this is what she wants? 

We are brand new to all of this so ANY advice would be greatly appreciated.",relationship_advice
t3_dlquvf,Husband (32m) is telling me (31f) to cut ties with family but I can't do it,"So here is the deal: my family can be very nosy in my life and like to meddle in my business.  However, they're my family and I don't have friends (I suck at making friends plus I do not trust in people very much) so they're my only support system even though they're out of state.  

Why my husband wants me to do this? My mother and brother are insisting that I tie my tubes so I won't have more children (I have a seven year old with Aspergers).  You're wondering why they care about that. Me too, me too.  Trust me.

Also. My mother and sometimes my dad (they're divorced) meddle too much in how my husband and I should raise our son.  I'm fed up with that and if I try to put my foot down, they become passive-aggressive.  

My husband is sick of my family and how, according to him, I don't do anything to stop them.  I'd be good if they stop but they're my family.  What if my husband dumps me? If I cut my family I will be all alone in the world.  

How can I tell my family to stop being so nosy without cutting them off?

t3_dloyp0,[Update] My most complicated post,"I confessed to my close friend and got rejected a couple months ago. I figured I would especially since she has a boyfriend but it was eating away at me for so long so I still did it so I could find peace. From her reaction that night, it was clear she already knew I had feelings for her. She just told me that I have to move on and forget about her in that sort of way. I suppose a small part of me had hope for the little chance we‚Äôd get together afterwards so since I confessed, I‚Äôve been distant. Me, her and couple people are in a group and before I confessed, we all hung out a lot. It‚Äôs been some time since I confessed and since then, we all haven‚Äôt hung out. 

Nows for the complicated part. My close friend has a sister, we‚Äôll call her A. She became part of our group not too long ago. Theirs also a guy in our group, we‚Äôll call him B, and he was in a relationship with A. A broke up with B maybe a month after they went out because my close friend kept pestering them and for other reasons A told me. B and I have known eachother for a while but only started talking this summer. Ever since he met A, he‚Äôs been talking to me about her. About how much she means to him and what not. He still does this despite the fact they‚Äôve broken up 6 months ago. I‚Äôm pretty sure he was using me as an emotional sponge. We haven‚Äôt spoke in awhile now.

I also got close to A. In fact when I first met her, I was interested but because B was into her so I kept my distance. A couple months ago I went to see A after so long to say high and bye since I was sure I wasn‚Äôt going to see her again or atleast for a while. We ended up talking for a bit. She seemed really sad about me telling her I‚Äôm distancing myself. She kept demanding an answer and saying things like ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre the coolest one‚Äù. I said wouldn‚Äôt that be B and she said ‚Äúno it‚Äôs always been you‚Äù etc. 

From the vibe I kept picking up, it seems like she‚Äôs interested in me. I got that vibe even when I asked if I could see her from her response. I don‚Äôt want to be an ass however. I keep picturing being in B‚Äôs shoes and how it‚Äôll feel if someone I trusted went out with my ex I still have feelings for. A is very cool though and as it is, we get along great. I can see myself with her but B is the only thing stopping me especially since if I get with A, B will be even more heartbroken and the rest of our group will hate me. And my close friend will think I‚Äôm scum for going for her then her sister. Then again, everyone in that group is fake so I can live without them.

Me and A text eachother every now and then still. Today‚Äôs her birthday so I wished her happy birthday. She said thanks with heart emojis then a little later mentioned how she missed me. She also asked when I was going to tell her why I decided to cut out group off. I just changed the subject and wished her happy birthday again. 

I think I‚Äôm going to get her a gift next week and then tell her I like her... I just don‚Äôt know how to do it. I‚Äôm also afraid  to tell her about me confessing to her sister. 

Update: A and B went to a festival together a couple days ago. I completely forgot B told me he was going to invite A to the festival a couple months ago and I supported this decision. I forgot to mention earlier but I actually tried to help A and B back together after they broke up for 2 reasons. 1, I saw how miserable B was after the break up. 2, The good friend in me took over rather than the other side that wants B all to myself. They posted pictures from the festival online with some Disney song in the background. A had a girl singing the song and B had a guy. Very cute but not so  good for me.

Should I throw in the towel and let them be or shoot my shot anyways? There a small chance she just went with him to the festival as friends but their posts strongly disagree. I think my best bet would be to ask A or B what they are and go on from that. I was thinking of getting back into the group then asking A if she still like B. Depending on what she says, I‚Äôll move on from there but I really don‚Äôt want to get back into that group. Any advice on what I should do?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqsxy,Trying to make things right before I let go,"Almost two weeks ago, my boyfriend broke up with me. It was absolutely the right move. I wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort into our relationship, and he called me out on it. Im extremely heartbroken (getting better every day) But I‚Äôm glad he stood up for himself. 

Since then, I‚Äôve made some serious changes. I immediately quit the video game I got seriously addicted to for almost a year (14 days now and feeling no urge to return) I got a job as a medical assistant (today was my 2nd day of training), I‚Äôve cooked 3 nights out of the week for two weeks (instead of never cooking), Ive done cardio workouts 4-5 times a week, I stopped regularly abusing my medication and now only take it as prescribed, I‚Äôm no longer procrastinating on house projects that need done (and the house has never been cleaner), and I‚Äôm reading through books on communication/relationships. In my spare time, I‚Äôm watching his favorite show that I Once said I wasn‚Äôt into (even though he watched all 6 seasons of *my* favorite show no questions asked). And no lie, I‚Äôm very much enjoying the show now. (I figure this might also help build rapport in our potential future) 

It‚Äôs been exhausting and difficult, but I‚Äôm getting through it. It‚Äôs probably the most extreme amount of change and work I‚Äôve ever gone through in such a short period of time. And it‚Äôs only just beginning. 

So yes, I‚Äôm doing all of this for *me.* But I‚Äôm also doing this as a *result* of what he said to me. ‚ÄúI want us working on ourselves...‚Äù he said. And so I‚Äôm doing that. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see *us* right now.‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt lie... I want my ex back.  Or at least, I want to see if the quality of our relationship would improve given these changes I‚Äôve strung together. Thanks to my ex, I‚Äôm no longer in a ‚Äútrance‚Äù by that video game, and the job would put him and I on an even playing field. (Our schedules would sync). The game and lack of work probably hurt our relationship the most. My priorities were a mess. 

I know it‚Äôs only been two weeks ‚Äî but I wanted to share this anyway.  Seems the art of seduction is subtle, and going to my Ex with a list of changes I‚Äôve just made will probably serve me no good. I know I have to wait until he contacts me...

It hit my father very hard, and he had a very hard time living alone after having been married to her most of his life. He went on a dating websites for widowers/widows (I previously didn't know this was a thing) and started a relationship with a widow about his age within a few months. Although I know my mother would have been fine with him starting a new relationship after her death (they mentioned this a few times when she was alive) it felt really quick to me. More importantly, my grandfather (my mother's father) is having a very hard time still with her death, and my father moving on so quickly is hard for him. To make matters worse, his new girlfriend has the same first name as my mother did, which means we must add 'new' or 'old' to disambiguate sometimes, which is obviously very uncomfortable.

While they cannot officially cohabitate or marry (both would lose their survivor's benefits, a surprisingly substantial amount of money), they announced they are planning an unofficial wedding ceremony. I'm not quite sure I want to attend. First of all, although love him and I'm happy for him having found new love, I don't feel this is reason to celebrate nor the time to do so withint a year of my mother's death, and even less so while my grandfather is still alive and grieving. Moreover, I feel it is very rushed. If it were for real, who would marry a person they first met less than a year ago? It makes me feel like it's really his grief driving him, with his new girlfriend filling the void left by my mother, and this is not a good basis for marriage (even if unofficial).

I'm not sure what to do, I don't really want to go but I don't want to let my father down either. Moreover, I don't like my father's actions being (unintentionally) painful to my grandfather, yet I don't really want to criticize him for his legitimate needs either.",relationship_advice

t3_dlqnkh,i don't want the sad to ruin my relationship,"(tw: mentions of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, suicide)

hey, this is my first time posting on reddit.

I was diagnosed with depression at age 18 (though I'm sure I had it since middle school) and have been getting on-and-off treatment since then. I'm 2o years old now. Earlier this year in February, I went to therapy again and started taking Prozac and started getting better. Much better. In those few months I felt that I was the happiest I had ever been. And I had very minimal suicidal thoughts which was great. I quit therapy sometime in August because we didn't have much to talk about during sessions which made me feel I was wasting my therapist's time. Fast forward to now, I didn't have transportation or money to pick up my prescription from the pharmacy at the beginning of September, so I stopped taking it.

I've gotten bad. really bad. started self harming again, feeling irritated, angry, at times numb. I'm sleeping a lot, etc.I start to isolate myself at times but I try to make myself go out (if I can) but anyway, overall, depression symptoms are back and I'm honestly expecting an episode soon. My problem is that I'm worried the symptoms will start affecting my relationship badly.

I (F, 20) started seeing this really sweet guy (M, 21) in August. It's been \~2 months but we're serious about each other. I think he's more serious about the relationship than I am (I'm more hesitant than him because of my living situation). The thing is, we started talking when I was doing well. But now I'm not, and I think he's noticed. I feel that I don't text him like I used it. I rarely check my phone through out the day and constantly telling him ""sorry, was asleep."" ""sorry,, wasn;t feeling well"" etc. Sometimes we're making out and in my head I'm thinking about the future worrying if I'm doing something wrong and thinking of past traumatic experiences then I get upset I ask him to stop kissing me then I just??? go quiet?? and sometimes I cry sometimes we cuddle but like I feel that it ruins whatever good thing was happening before.

One thing I mention to my therapists often is that I think I will eventually die by suicide??? My thing is, 11% of people suffering from depression eventually die by suicide. And it's been so hard and every time I get into a depressive episode, I think I will never get out of it. Like, studies show that the more depressive episodes you go through the worse it is in the next episode. I've attempted suicide three times already. I know things will get harder in the future, but I don't know if I will be strong enough to pull myself out of it again. It just, really sucks. I thought about going to therapy again, but it feels like it's no use. I already know what my therapist is going to say. Continue taking my meds and calling up some friends to hang. Those things aren't possible for me right now and she won't understand that. I know going to therapy will make me feel guilty and awful. I hate feeling bad for myself I feel so gross and pathetic and I feel awful about it.

I'm unable to be with this guy atm because I live with my parents and it's a toxic environment and things are complicated. I must conceal my relationship from them because I shouldn't be dating. I'm worried about them finding out about him and making things worse. so in my head 247 thinking of a million scenarios where things go wrong and my parents act violently towards me, i become homeless, I am forced into an arranged marriage, etc. And in my head, I'm already going through enough so any of these events could lead to my breaking point. I wouldn't be surprised if I were to die by suicide them. I mean, nothing is guaranteed. I don't know what the future looks like for me.

I know that we're serious about each other, and have similar intentions of a long term relationship and potentially a LDR (he's okay with it and he is aware of my situation), but anything could go wrong and I don't want to break his heart. ):

It's just, I'm in a lot of pain. He's been very supportive and he asks how I am and offers support and holds me when I cry and all the good things. Once he got me fishnets and it was my first time trying them on so I sent him pictures of them. Some of my cutting scars were visible if you were to zoom into the photo but I didn't think much of it and honestly felt that I looked hot at the time. He complimented me and about 30mins later sent a (not) random text saying ""we talk about a lot of random things, if you ever wanna talk about mental health thing, im here"" which tells me he saw. I'm honestly so conscious about it and I feel that whenever things start getting more physical and intimate between us I won't want him to see my legs but Idek what I would say to him): He knows I self harm because it came up in a conversation about how people start using substances or start using unhealthy coping mechanism. I feel that if I were to say something ""I don't want you to pay attention to the scars on my thighs"" then I want attention (that would b the 3rd time i bring it up)

Overall he's been so kind and understanding and I'm afraid of crossing a line or for this relationship to be toxic to him???? I've dated someone before (when I was doing good) and they weren't getting treated for depression and they didn't communicate with me what was going on and lacked empathy and were so rude and unkind to me and I would hate to be the same to him. I know I'm not right now but also I don't want for this to get worse and for me to be hurting him without knowing does that make sense. ?

Any advice on what to do?? If I were to talk to him about it what should I say??

TL;DR: I'm struggling with depression and I don't want it to ruin a healthy relationship.

t3_dlqnhk,Boyfriend (21 M) always changes views on the world,"Hi guys! I haven‚Äôt been able to find any posts about this so I thought I‚Äôd make my own.

I understand opening your mind to new perspectives, but his whole demeanor will change when he makes a shift in his views. Not only that, but he goes through an endless cycle of making drastic changes in his routine and then getting upset when he fails at them. As a result, he will be cold to me because he is frustrated at his own failures. I can‚Äôt keep up with this and I try to talk to him and he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal, humans just change‚Äù.

t3_dln9ho,Girlfriend of almost 3 years suddenly seems distant,"My girlfriend (F mid-20's) and I (M late 20's) have been together for almost 3 years now. It started out as a long distance relationship (a couple hours away) then she decided to move a bit closer to me. (To be clear she didn't move to be closer to me, but she says it did play a factor when looking for a new job. Her field of work allows her to work just about anywhere; my field of work not so much). A few months after she moved she was extremely unhappy with the place she was working at and told me she wanted to look for another job out state (a few hours away). Employment restrictions prevented her from simply moving to a different city within the same state. We sat down and had a discussion about it and talked about what we did and didn't like, weighed pros and cons, and I ended up telling her I'd support her decision in moving away and we'd do our best to make things work.

So a couple of months ago she made her move. I've been traveling when I'm able for a few days while she's off work to go and spend time with her, then drive back to give her space while she works. And this is where things began to feel off.

For the longest time, especially since she moved closer to me she made little effort to come and see me. I'd always be the one going to her. Also since she's moved further away again she's made no attempt to come visit me. And it's just seemed so one-sided. When we're together it's great. We get along well and always have lots of fun. 

The difficulty has always been making plans to get together and I don't mean logistically. She would rarely, if ever, ask me to come down to see her or offer to come up and see me. I'd always have to be the one to ask. ""When are you off work next? Did you want me to come down and see you on your days off?"" And her response would always be something vague and transparent. Usually it's something like ""Up to you."" I'd tell her that doesn't answer my question and she just repeats herself. Then I'd ask if she would rather have a few days off to herself to relax instead, and she just refuses to change her response. Let me reiterate that we always seem to have a great time being around each other whether we go out and do something and just sit around and do nothing. We definitely seem to enjoy each other's company.

So fast forward to a just over a week ago. I come back from having seen her for a few days and everything seemed good. Then a couple of days after she got suddenly distant. Like minimal responses to my texts and messages. One word replies. Never initiating any conversation whatsoever. I asked her is something was wrong because it seemed out of character of her. She assured me she was fine and left it at that. It's been almost 2 weeks and no improvement. I've asked her when she was off next to see if I could come see her and all she told me was she hasn't decided what she was going to be doing and left it at that.

I'm nearing my wits end here because obviously something is up but I don't know if it's something with her, something with me, or something between us. I'm waiting for the next time I see her to bring it up in person since she just shuts down any conversation I try to initiate through text. This didn't start until a couple days after I had seen her last and there's nothing that I believe I said or did to cause this, and going through my text logs, there's nothing I seem to have said in those couple of days that would cause her to be upset with me?

So I've just been giving her space because being too clingy certainly won't help things, but at the same time she makes it difficult/impossible to have any meaningful conversation with her. I don't believe she's seeing someone else because shes the type of person who would break things off before pursuing another person.

t3_dlqjrz,Haunting past relived in dream,"So let‚Äôs start off with...when I was 13 I was raped/molested several of times. I‚Äôve grown from then and tried to move past it. Currently my fianc√© (34M) and  I (30F) have been together for almost 11 years, full commitment and he does know of this past. 
So with all that, last night I had a dream that I walked into this weird Japan room- very big, mattress on the floor with lots of pillows and mood setting lights. Then I see my fianc√©e laying there and next to him is this tiny girl. Laying stiff but alive next to him; she had some kind of wrap around her eyes. There‚Äôs a voice from the room that‚Äôs her voice saying she‚Äôs ready to die. I‚Äôm not really sure that in my dream I know how there are certain rules. So when I hear her voice again that‚Äôs when the play starts. He tells me to just go. So I back out of the room and I start to hear her voice- his body moves towards her almost like he has no control over it. The door shut in front of me and at this point I know what‚Äôs about to happen... I run far away down the hallway but I hear him start to rape her.....I hear the most heart wrenching calls for help and screams from her..and then choke her to death and silence.I end up waiting in our car on the side of a busy road in the town. When I left him it was night, the next time- when I‚Äôm sitting, it‚Äôs late morning. I see him with a nice coat casually walking towards the car and gets in. Proceeds to drive us both home- not saying anything and acting like nothing happened. Then I woke up in deep sweat. I tried to go back to sleep but honestly all I could hear were her screams echoing down the hallways. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt even look at him when I woke up. I broke down in tears in bed. After an hour I just got dressed and left to the store to get some air and some me time. He texted me asking if everything was ok cuz I never just leave without saying bye. I get back home and just tell him that I had a bad dream but no details- as he comforts me, I feel disconnected from him and just cry. I don‚Äôt know how I can convince myself it was just a dream. I don‚Äôt even want to be around him at all. Any advice?",relationship_advice

To be fair, he has always had this ""immature"" side to him but I always thought it was something he would grow out of. However, he has not made any improvements throughout the years, if anything he became even more immature. His mother has always made his choices even regarding which program and classes he should take in school and he never put himself out there on his own. He always needs a push from someone. I tried to tell him that we need to take things more seriously especially if we are thinking of having a family. He is often afraid of failure or even accepting job offers that would make him a more rounded person. He is comfortable with just using his mother's money and he tells me that he will just continue the family business. He does not have anything on his CV because he never had a job. I think that he needs to step out of his comfort zone and learn some things the hard way in order to mature. I suggested that he stops using his family's money and that he should finish his university degree (he has been dropping classes on and off and his overall grades are very low) , find a job and that we should start paying by ourselves. But I don't see him making any steps towards that. He does not have any achievements and therefore has very low-self esteem to the point that he doesn't want to hang out with people which he thinks are ""smarter than him"". As soon as he is faced with a brick wall he is not willing to break it. He prefers just being comfortable and playing video games and watching movies all day long. He is very un-motivated and immature about life in general. I love him very much and I want to help him without nagging and playing the role of his mother. Any suggestions?",relationship_advice
t3_dlqhdi,I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to feel about relationship,"Okay brief history but I met this girl about 7 weeks ago online and have been talking to her since then.

I‚Äôm very concerned about my GF. She‚Äôs a really loving and caring person. Plus she‚Äôs the most selfless person I have ever met. But that‚Äôs also the problem.

She never cares for herself. She‚Äôs the type of the person that would take all the pain from a person and suffer in order to make the other person happy. 

And that exactly is happening between her and her dad. They don‚Äôt have a healthy relationship. Her dad is a very busy businessman and became unfortunately (because of all the stress of his company) addicted to alcohol and gambling. 

Hes stuck in a vicious cycle in where he increases his stress by constantly drinking and gambling everyday which is only making him more problems everyday. 

That‚Äôs whats making my GF depressed. She cares a lot for him and seeing him in so much stress just frustrates and depresses her more and more. 

Now she really tried everything to help him get out of there. But her dad is the type of the person who is not letting anyone help him.

My GF is now also stuck in a vicious cycle where she tries everyday to help him. But in the end she just get rejected again. This hurts her a lot and she can‚Äôt cope with this. 

Unfortunately she isn‚Äôt able to help him and she doesn‚Äôt want to understand that. 

I‚Äôm very concerned for her as I see her everyday getting frustrated again and it‚Äôs not headed in a good direction.

I don‚Äôt know how to help her or even her dad. I don‚Äôt know how to teach her that it‚Äôs not possible to help him. He is really important to her and that‚Äôs why she do not want to understand that she can‚Äôt help him or to move on.

She was strong, funny, caring, not to mention fucking gods most perfect creation, but... heres the catch. She was against any and all ‚Äùcouples‚Äù things. Like kissing in public, just a quick goodbye kiss, letting other people know we were together, tagging eachother in social medias, all ‚Äùcutesy‚Äù things.

t3_dloewm,My [33M] marriage with my wife [35F] is looking bad. I've started counceling and I need more advice.,"TlDR: She says I need to be more emotionally there for her. I need advise on how to do that. But is there something else?

Its not looking good guys. Our history - we have been married for over 8 years (we met just out of high school) and we have 3 kids ages 3-8. Our marriage has been pretty awesome for first 5 or so years then started to get a little rocky.

Of course when the first kid came along the alone time we enjoyed pretty much evaporated and now with 3 kids its nearly impossible. We've had a few minor fights but nothing too serious. 

Last month I messed up and didn't schedule a short get away while we had the chance. I didn't partially because I kind of wanted to just to stay home and do nothing for once and partially because she made a comment about going to see a friend during that time. So i assumed that she would just go see a friend. Big mistake.

She got really really upset and said we should separate and i should start seeing a counselor because I'm never emotionally there for her and haven't been for over a year. We started counceling and agreed that living apart wouldn't be the best idea.

Fast forward to now and she just got back from a work trip and pretty much ghosted me, she wouldnt even kiss me on the lips. She barely talked to me before she left too. Last night she suggested separation again and we had a big blow out again and now i have till the end of November to find a place to stay. 

Her ghosting me felt off to me and i ended up looking at our phone logs and turns out shes been texting pretty much everyone but me.

Or shall I wait for him to text me?? I don't get it. I never speak to guys in real life. The guy I dated in real life I actually met him online. It just happened that he wasn't super far away. Because I usually dated american guys. I don't get the rules of what to do and what not to do. When a guy is flirting with me I think he actually wants me. This just happened again today. I talked a week to this guy online. We called every night for like 8 hours. He was cute and said nice things to me. He was just great. And today he said he doesn't really feel the same. I keep getting hurt like that. I also rush things sometimes. I met a cute guy and I didn't know him very long yet and I texted I miss him at some point and he never texted back ): i feel like I never learn from that shit. It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me. I just don't wanna get hurt. I should take a break from social Media. I delete snapchat/discord/insta etc. But I install it again 4 hours later. Idk. I should take a break for at least a few days or something. I need to focus on other things.,relationship_advice

Their is a girl that I had begun to talk to again and we both became great friends. I could always see that we had some chemistry and I THINK she noticed some too, we both had common interest and liked al the same stuff.Today was the perfect opportunity to ask her out, she needed a ride home and I offered to take her and she said YES. I was so excited.... finally I would get the girl. We both jumped in the car talked, laughed and both enjoyed the same music, we stopped by DQ on the way there and it was perfect we were flirting and everything. Once we got to her house I let her get all her stuff and she even invited me inside but then I asked and I quote ""Hey I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime?""She then responded with ""I'm sorry but I have a boyfriend but we could hang out as friends"". As soon as I heard boyfriend everything went quiet and all I could said was "" ya...ok"" and I drove off. 

I'm hoping that you guys could hopefully help me with this and if I should try again with her when she doesn't have a boyfriend or just give up on her. Also stuff that I can work on to actually ""get the girl""",relationship_advice
t3_dli921,He's Religious. I'm Not. How Do We meet In The Middle?,"Before getting into a relationship, we talked about religion. I was worried that I would be in the way of his relationship with God and that I didn't want to interfere. He reassured me and told me that as long as we respect each other's views that we would be fine. This was two months ago.

Then last night he called me and told me that he feels like ""our relationship is hindering him and his religion,"" and it hurt so much. He said how it's hard to express himself in that way and that he wants to be able to, but that it's hard because I can't ever relate to him. I asked him how can I help and what can I do to be a better and supportive girlfriend, but he says that I have been really respectful of him and his religion, allowing him to sing songs to me, allowing him to pray, and being open to talking about religion, and says that he's really thankful that I have been nothing but supportive and open. He says that he really wants to be with me and that we wants to give this a chance, and I do too. He says that if he didn't think we could work it out that he wouldn't even bother bringing this up and instead just leave me. And as of now, I should just continue to be myself and not change for him. 

The thing that sucks about all this is that I can't change and he can't change and that we have to accept each other. I know we'll get to that place of accepting each other, but even then I still feel like he would be better off with someone else who IS religious and someone he can share that with. And I feel like we're so young (me being F19 and him being M20) that I don't know if it would be realistic to put all of my hope into thinking that we could actually last for a long time and  through this because again it's out of my control. I feel like I either have two choices:

1. Leave because we deserve better people + we're young + it's early in our relationship so cutting it off now would be best,

or 2. Give it a chance and try my best to make this work while keeping in mind that even if it doesn't work that it's not my fault (unless otherwise) and that it just means that I need to find myself someone who is better fit for me and same goes for him

I like this guy a lot and am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any advice?

UPDATE: I have made my choice. Although at first I was very conflicted on what I want, I know that I like him a lot and that if I truly loved him that I would see him for the person he is and not his religion. I want to clarify that I am deeply respectful of his religion and his decisions as both an individual and a person of God. I was mentioning how I was scared of getting hurt and the possibility of our relationship ending because of religion, but not anymore. Why? What changed? I talked to someone who was in a position where she was solely religious and has come out from that. She told me how it takes time for someone who is religious to adjust themselves for others and it's not easy. I can see where she is coming from along with my boyfriend and it's fair. She said even after going through a few break ups with her current boyfriend that it was hard for the both of them, but she learned that she needed to look at the relationship as a relationship with two people who are great listeners or genuinely kind hearted individuals, and not two people who hold different spiritual or religious point of views. That's why I am not scared, because I know that even if things don't work out that it has nothing to do with me (that is, if I truly accept and stop mopping about this one little difference), and that if he leaves me that I should be happy for him. And I will be happy for him for it will provide me with a sense of reassurance and closure. I can't ever tell the future nor can I tell how he will feel about me years, months, or days from now, but I know that for one thing I really want to be with him and there's nothing else I want. I wanna be there for him when he's low, when he's happy, and when he's in a mood to express his love for God. I want to be a part of that journey. I can't ever know how he feels about me, but knowing that I can make peace with this, try my best, and be content with the outcomes is what I truly believe is enough. If you are reading this and going through a tough time, know that it will be hard, it will hurt, but we have to put aside our needs and desires for something true. For instance, I was selfish and scared to get hurt with the possibility that he may leave me, but damn how worse would it be looking back and remembering that I broke up with him without giving it a chance? I do feel that religion, yes, is a touchy subject and can be really difficult to adjust to, but with the right people, right mindsets, and clear boundaries will there come brighter days. I have faith in him and I hope he has that with me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlt3uj,I (22M) am out of my girlfriend's (19F) league and I want to break up.,"First off, sorry if my writing is kind of all over the place.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been off and on with my girlfriend for the last year. We met about a couple days into the new school year last year and became friends. After about two weeks, we hooked up and started seeing each other much more, eventually turning into a dating relationship. We broke up right before winter break, got back together after winter break, broke up again a month into summer break, then got back together about a month before school started up again.

&amp;#x200B;

These are what my genuine concerns are:

I don't feel comfortable with her in public because of the thought of not having one of the best looking girls

The only time I feel 100% comfortable with her is when we are alone or I am a bit buzzed

I am being told by my parents that I am MUCH better looking than she is

I know I am much better looking because I know other more attractive ladies that are into me

I enjoy to workout, she doesn't

She doesn't try to make good relationships with her teammates, I do with mine (we are both wrestlers at this college)

She is not very popular with her team. Popular as in her teammates wanting to actually hangout with her during free time

Other girls dislike her just because I am with her (jealous? idk)

I want to thrive to become better everyday and want better things, she just wants to go with the flow.

The only thing we really have in common is being able to joke around and get along very  well

We got together really fast and it just feels like I'm settling because I found someone to like me a whole lot and can have intense sex with.

I don't think I want to be in a relationship anymore/ I want to chase after other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might think that it is kind of fucked up that I judge a girl by her looks, which is partially true. But the thing is, I want the best. I want to be the best at what I do and I want to be with the best lady I can be with. Personality wise she is a cool person. But that is all. She has not done anything to screw me over or for me to be mad at. She has been nothing but good to me, which makes me real unsure about how and when I would break up with her. I have been texting her less and seeing her less, and it has been really easy for me to do so. The lovey dovey stage is over for me and now I feel over it. All of her friends are my friends and all of my friends are her friends. Not to sound arrogant, but we have been known as the ""ideal couple"" around our different groups of friends. This is mostly because that we never argue or have problems. Her friends talk so highly of me too because I always make sure to treat her like a lady and address any concerns she may have.

I don't know how to break it off with her. I am sure not going to say some shit like ""im out of your league"", but I do not know what else to say. I do not want this to be a bad breakup where a whole group of her friends are going to hate me or treat me different (we go to a small school so everyone knows everyone).

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions, thoughts, or ideas about my situation? If any of yall have questions, I will answer them. Pick my brain and help me find a way to break it off.

t3_dlq8al,Conflicted about how I feel about my friends,"I‚Äôve known my two friends for well over a year now, long distance (I‚Äôll call them T and D)

They‚Äôre the most special people in my life, only thing is that I‚Äôm not so special to them 

I know I can‚Äôt change how much others care about me, should I keep trying to learn to accept that?

They‚Äôre practically dating which is totally chill, and they‚Äôve both got a group of friends

T is a more emotional person while D is a more privately emotional person, she keeps to herself a lot 

I‚Äôve always seeked D‚Äôs validation, I‚Äôve spent 8 hours making crafts for her (we are arty people) and I‚Äôve made multiple of them, and when a special event comes around (her birthday or Christmas) I spend two weeks making her a gift, I‚Äôve even sent her a package before, which she‚Äôs appreciated 

Only thing is, even after all that T asked her if she cared about me and she said ‚Äúeh‚Äù

It‚Äôs been months and the answer has turned into a yes, but she said she doesn‚Äôt love me, she only loves T

I understand this, I just don‚Äôt know how to feel

D has suddenly lost a bunch of energy and doesn‚Äôt talk to me as much, maybe three or less messages a day, and she‚Äôll often be active but not respond to me at all

If I stop responding however she will get worried if she did something 

T and D make everything about one another, and I happen to witness a lot of it which makes me feel hurt when I‚Äôm being ignored by D and T tells me how lovey she‚Äôs being 

T and D constantly make gifts for one another and T used to show me all of it, however I never receive any gifts from them, despite me always giving them gifts 

Is it selfish of me to want something in return sometimes?

On T and I‚Äôs friend anniversary I made her a gift !! But she didn‚Äôt make me one, which is fine she often doesn‚Äôt have time to

However later that day she made D not one, by two gifts and showed them to me

And she later left me alone to go on a call with D, it felt like she made our day about her and D. She apologized for this saying she wasn‚Äôt thinking, but it still hurt 

I tried talking to them about how I feel but things haven‚Äôt really changed 

I always wanted T D and I to be a trio, but D expressed to T that she doesn‚Äôt want to be part of it, admitting she felt mean saying that

I don‚Äôt know how to feel, I want to be special to them like they are to me, I don‚Äôt want to leave them and I‚Äôve had a really hard time making new friends after meeting them, mostly because I don‚Äôt want their attention as much as I want my friends‚Äô

I‚Äôve been trying to learn to accept just being part of their crowd, but it‚Äôs hard and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore

I feel like I‚Äôm starting to give up, they care but why can‚Äôt I feel it? Have I given too much? Am I too much? Am I an asshole for wanting so much of their attention? 

TL;DR - doing everything I can for my friends but I‚Äôm still not anyone special to them, what do I do?",relationship_advice

t3_dlq50p,My boyfriend's [26M] attitude towards me changes whenever I [24F] say I'm on my period,"When I tell him I'm on my period, suddenly everything I say after that, he'll take it in a negative way even though I'm just saying it like I usually would.

We're talking on the phone and if he's in a bad mood, he'll suddenly hang up on me because I'm trying to ""start a fight"", which I'm not? He won't talk to me much because he ""doesn't want to deal with a crazy psycho"". I do admit there are times I've gotten really angry, it's usually because he finds it hilarious to get me mad ""for fun"". This happens despite being on period or not but it seems like only remembers me getting mad and forgets the reason why.

We hardly get to see each other, once every 1-2 months maybe. I have Sat/Sunday off, he has random days of the week off. 2 weeks ago, when our weekends aligned, I was ready to do the 6 hour drive. The night before, I mentioned I was just finishing my period and suddenly he tells me not to come anymore because he doesn't have the energy to deal with me going crazy? I was really hurt and upset

I didn't bother telling him about my period last week, and when he asked, I said I already finished. I brought up (again) how nothing about me is different, but when I do tell him I'm on my period, his whole attitude towards me changes. He brushes me off like he usually does and told me to stop being childish (because I keep bringing this up) and that I ""must have tried really hard to not go crazy"". Um okay?

I'm so frustrated but not sure how to respond here since I feel bad for her/want to help.

My gf is very insecure. Always has been insecure but especially right now because she has had some bad luck lately and is going through a hard time. She got in a car wreck and lost her job, and she has also gained some weight due to stress eating. She's noticeably heavier and cant fit into old clothes so she feels terrible. 

I try to help by reassuring her that she is always beautiful to me (she is), being affectionate with her, offering help and support, being there for her, encouraging texts. 

But she has started directing her feelings at me. Generally being rude/hateful and honestly a total bitch sometimes just because I have good things going on. 

She hates on me because I have a good paying job working for my dad's business and her only options rn are retail, so she says I'm just spoiled/entitled and don't realize how lucky I am. That I only got the job because of ""neopotism"" and I got lucky, meanwhile she's suffering because she gets no ""free handouts.""

Hates on me because I drive a nice car (that I worked hard to buy) that will last me a long time and she wrecked her nice car, so now she drives an old beat up corolla and says that I ""think I'm better than her"" because I drive a nice car. I dont think I'm better than her!! I have not said one word about anything! I never brag. 

Hates on me because I am naturally very skinny and dont gain weight easily. This is actually something I am insecure about, as I'd like to gain more weight (muscle) but she compares her body to mine. Said that I think I'm better than her because she is fat (she is not) and sometimes even just yells at me not to look at her. I remind her that she isn't fat, and that I'm a lot taller than her and also a dude so it's not a good idea to compare, and that shes beautiful anyways.

 I try to suggest we go on walks/jogs together if it will make her feel better, she turns me down so I let it go.

There are other things, but you get the picture. How tf do you deal with your partner being ""jealous"" of you? I don't brag about anything ever and it would be stupid if I did. It's like she hates anything ""good"" that I have and makes it about her and why she is a victim. 

Is there any way I can help her feel better or should I somehow put my foot down? What to say? Am tired of the rudeness.",relationship_advice

I love him more than anything else in the world, he means everything to me.

For example, just now him and I were texting somewhat consistently, and after he sent one message I didn‚Äôt notice my phone go off. I was pretty into a movie I was watching, so I didn‚Äôt really think to check my phone. An hour later, I check and see he texted, so I responded along the lines of ‚Äúoh shit my bad I didn‚Äôt notice that text, what‚Äôs up‚Äù.

t3_dlq28c,"Am I thinking too much, is it me? Or is he at wrong?","I've been dating¬†my boyfriend¬†for a year now and I have run into a few frustrating experiences and I'm just wondering if it's me or them. In part I do feel like I am very attached and needy, so in stating everything that follows I want to be fair enough to provide that preface while proceeding to detail everything. Right now I am just very frustrated and I think it is mostly to do with me, however I know that this person is still at wrong in certain instances. I think I tend to draw things out of proportion, over analyze and overthink on things. I also do not know how to address the wrong, I tend to get frustrated and accuse my significant other when I suspect them of something. A lot of the problems I have with him is trust, communication, quality time, and his friendships with other female friends.One reoccurring issue I am having right now is the fact that he sleep talks sometimes. In the past I have heard him state all of the following while sleep talking  
¬†""One girl likes this {sexual excerpt/position} and the other girl likes this{sexual excerpt/position} done to her""He has on occasion¬†been sleep talking¬†to someone in Spanish (I don't speak Spanish), while sexual fondling me""I consider myself sexually social""""This girl had big tit¬† and she liked it {more sexual¬†excerpt}'  
He will again sexually fondle me¬†while¬†talking to someone else, whilst dreaming. I have addressed these all with him and he states that this is not a natural representation of who he is. The sexually social one was most recent, it angered me the most. He stated this the night before he left on a business trip. The morning of said ""sexually social"" dream, as he was getting ready to go on said trip. On the morning he was leaving to this trip he made sure to shave, did not wear his glasses as he usually does 89% of time, instead he wore contacts. On top of this he fixed his hair and instead of wearing a normal work shirt then left with a dress collared shirt instead of a t-shirt which is what he normally wears, as he is not required to dress up for this job.¬† I then addressed the dream thing with him which he¬†pushed off as just a dream and told me not¬†to worry,¬†he then took his bags and is to be gone for three days. He has been taking work trips more frequently and another issue I am having is communication. In the end I want a relationship with someone who¬†values me and wants to talk to me.¬†He recently took another work trip for a week and I averaged an hour of talk time for that week.¬† He would often call me for a few minutes and state that he had to go because he was at dinner, out, etc. He is on a trip with good people, all have girlfriends as well. In the end I trust him although his behaviors are innocent, I still have doubts and concerns that run into my mind. I talked to him later in the evening after work for his business trip and he stated to me that he was going to meet up with some mutual friends of one of his work friends. I contemplated if his whole change in his physical appearance was attributed to the fact that he is in a different town, or more so that he was meeting these ""friends"" as he might know who all might be there.There are times when we are hanging out and instead of us enjoying our time, he makes it a point to invite someone else.I don't understand why we can't enjoy our time together alone. This is on a constant basis that he is inviting someone or someone is casually entering in our time together.Another annoying and sometimes hurtful habit he will have is social media. There are times where I'll notice he is active posting on instagram and will not make the imitative to communicate with me. Sometimes he will be completely engulfed into instagram, while we are trying to spend time together. He also has two female friends which I do not enjoy hanging around. One of the friends I have made countless attempts to get along with and am not able to. She seems to treat me right only when we are together as a group. However when I try to get along with her on my own we do not get along. I will try to talk to her and she will often cut me short or make very derogatory comments. another female friend of his is someone who tends¬†to flirt with him¬†while I'm around them both, he will¬†sometimes feed into it and I dislike it.¬†  
I understand he has to have his life and he is not perfect but I feel like I am internally at a constant struggle to reason through everything. Is he wrong for the things I mentioned(maybe for not even most of them?) or is it just me?",relationship_advice

t3_dlswri,How do I [27f] maintain a mutually beneficial friendship with someone [27f] that refuses to help herself?,"My best friend is an INFP and I am an INTP. We frequently have communication issues and fights where she feels I am not being sensitive enough, while I think she is projecting her insecurities onto me. I'm exhausted. I love her and care about her and want to maintain a friendship, but it is tiring being around someone who would rather complain about the same problems every day instead of trying to fix them.

For example, one night we both talked about how we needed to put more effort in at our respective jobs, despite not being excited about the work. Something that would require self-discipline. The next day at work, she sent me messages talking about how bored she was. I suggested just 10 minutes on a project would count as progress and help her actualize the goals she stated yesterday. She told me that she didn't want to be lectured and couldn't do it because she didn't want to.

I brought her to a spin class hoping she would appreciate the external motivation. She hopped off her bike early, refused to stretch with the rest of the class, and said (within earshot of the instructor) that she ""was never coming back"". I didn't bring it up because I know she didn't mean to be rude and she was just feeling insecure about not being able to keep up and simply didn't enjoy the activity. I made sure to champion her for trying it and learning something new about her preferences, but she had a bad mood for hours afterward.

She constantly talks about how ugly, fat, and worthless she is, yet gets offended if I try to provide resources on insecurity and emotional regulation. She does see a therapist. We had previously tried a mutually-agreed upon ""no negativity"" rule, but she gave up quickly and called me controlling when I tried to hold us both accountable.

I'm at my wit's end trying to be supportive without being enabling. She takes issue with me trying to solve her issues instead of commiserating, but it goes against my problem-solving nature to validate the actions of someone who is hurting themselves.

Help please. I'm afraid of her being hurt if she sees this, but I'm more afraid of losing a good friend to her own harmful thoughts.",relationship_advice

My (21F) ex (23M) recently said he loves me and misses me and is working towards being better for me

In the meantime, I know he is talking to another girl who is interested in him 

When I brought up to him that he's seeing other girls he said I don't listen to him when he says he's suicidal and struggling to cope with all the pressure and that all I seem to care about is him moving on when he didn't want to break up in the first place but felt it had to be done. 

He dumped me. And I feel shitty and gaslit. I can't tell what's real with him anymore. I guess maybe he could be just talking to her because he's lonely? I'm so tired and depressed rn. I want to scream

He‚Äôs sweet, selfless, understanding, nice, and respectful. However, constantly in the relationship I have felt unhappy. I know why but I am trying to figure out whether it‚Äôs something that can be fixed or overlooked. Here they are: 

‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt find him physically/sexually attractive at all. (Like he‚Äôs cute and all but I think it‚Äôs disgusting when I kiss him and hugging is okay)
‚Ä¢I have big insecurities but he does flirt with a lot of girls. He‚Äôs obviously crushing hard on my cousin - that‚Äôs been for at least a year now. 
‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt think I can trust him but because of the person he is at heart, he probably wouldn‚Äôt. 
‚Ä¢I have never cheated but I badly want to see what it‚Äôs like with another guy. I want to flirt and see what it‚Äôs like to be single again. 
‚Ä¢I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll make a mistake later on and realize I should‚Äôve just dealt with it. 
‚Ä¢I miss him when I‚Äôm like not with him but not when I‚Äôm with him. (duh he‚Äôs there)
‚Ä¢We act more like best friends and joke with each other a lot more than couples (Which I enjoy more than being all cute) - i know this is fine for some people in relationships but I crave a relationship where I actually want to hug and kiss and cuddle a lot but I don‚Äôt want to do that with him.
‚Ä¢ ^^^Thats actually really weird bc i get mega jealous when he does all this flirting or talking to girls?? Like I‚Äôm emotionally in love with him but physically not?

However, I am trying to start appreciate him more and let go of some of my insecurities. However, some of the stuff he does I know is not my insecurities. 

(we already had a small break for me to try and figure out my feelings - it was better to be with him than be alone) 

The Problem: I don‚Äôt know whether I should continue the relationship or end it officially.

we‚Äôve been working hard on our communication but sometimes we will have small disagreements that blow up into absurd fights. i have tried very hard to keep her bpd in mind when i navigate these fights, and im careful and respectful, but she doesn‚Äôt like when i voice my feelings or request an apology for something she has done wrong. occasionally manipulation tactics will be used, and then the silent treatment. she can avoid me for DAYS. it gets to the point where i feel like im on eggshells (and i hate having to say that). im in love with this girl. i want to spend my life with her. she has expressed wanting to spend hers with me, and wanting to get married and have children.

so here‚Äôs where my question comes in: my girlfriend will be getting treated for her bpd when we move in together. can anyone shed some light on whether they have been in my shoes, and whether their situation with a bpd partner improved after treatment?

Well, she got a new job so naturally I didn‚Äôt see her as much but we still texted all the time. Well that all changed seemingly out of the blue. I got really busy with finals and we didn‚Äôt talk for a bit. After my classes were over I texted her to see what was going on. She never texted me back. So i tried a Facebook message, nothing. Instagram, nothing. I sent one more text, still nothing. So I was a bit concerned/confused so I messaged the dude that she was seeing casually for a bit.

Turns out, she told him that I no longer care about her and that I‚Äôve alienated her. I honestly have no clue how she got that idea.

t3_dlsrr7,Coworker friend (28m) gets drunk &amp; confesses feelings for me (30F). Then doesn‚Äôt remember?!?,"Just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar and your take on it? 

Honestly at the time it happened we had both been drinking but always have deep talks about all kinds of things. It seemed a natural progression. I did not get the vibe he was at that point of drunkenness at all but we‚Äôve only hung out outside of work a few times and drank together even less.

I‚Äôm honestly wishing I could forget what he said because it was all things I felt too. I highly doubt he was lying because of how much it all resonated. And if he was just saying things to attempt to get laid could have easily gone home with me that night but he didn‚Äôt. 

I am older and have a position at our job that could deem our ‚Äúsituation‚Äù unprofessional if not handled correctly. It wouldn‚Äôt break any policies or anything but it would be a bit sticky to navigate.

Since that night I‚Äôve taken the high road. He knows he said some ‚Äúsweet‚Äù things but I figure if he truly can‚Äôt remember them or is denying them then they don‚Äôt matter anyway, right? The entire thing has definitely thrown me for a loop. 

We have an awesome connection/bond that even I don‚Äôt understand fully and it sucks to feel like I have to put up that wall now and can‚Äôt really trust him. We‚Äôve been very close friends for about 9 months now but had only recently begun hanging out together outside of work.

t3_dlsrcm,Should I (f 17) be worried that my sister (26) appears to treat her husband (30?) as an authority figure,"I‚Äôve been staying with my sister for a couple of weeks now and this is the most time I‚Äôve spent with her in a long time. The last time I saw her was 2015. I live in New York and she lives in Florida. We share a father and she was raised by him but I‚Äôve been raised by my mom. My mom and I don‚Äôt really get along anymore and her boyfriend treats me really badly so I asked my sister if I could live with her and she said yes. 

I‚Äôve just noticed the way my sister is with her husband and it just gives me a bad vibe. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overthinking though. But she really just worships the ground he walks on. She waits on him hand and foot. She looks at him with adoration but also just honestly seems fearful of him. Like she‚Äôs very meek around him and I‚Äôve noticed a few times her hands shake and her eyes water around him. It‚Äôs weird. She‚Äôs all ‚Äúyes baby‚Äù this and ‚Äúyes baby‚Äù that I haven‚Äôt heard her say no to him once. The best way to describe it is she treats him almost like really high authority, like a king or a god. 

He‚Äôs been nice to me and he is very charming but it‚Äôs also clear to me he has a very big ego.

And then the biggest thing is, a few nights ago I heard a sound that really sounded like he hit her but I can‚Äôt be sure and then I heard her crying in the bath a little after that. And then there were flowers on the table the next morning. 

I don‚Äôt know. My sister seems happy mostly, and all she really does is lay around and drink and go out she enjoys her life for all I have seen. Her husband also seems to buy her a lot of gifts, she has a lot of jewelry and other things from him. He bought her a really nice car on her birthday that was recent. But I don‚Äôt know she just also seems a little sad at the same time.

Should I be worried for her? Should I just wait and see if I notice anything more? And if I do? I‚Äôm kinda lost on what I should be doing. It gives me a really bad feeling that‚Äôs all, but maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking everything.",relationship_advice
t3_dlnvc3,"The last week has caused a major rift between me [19M] and my girlfriend [19F], and I don't know how to fix it","Last week, my girlfriend and I decided to get engaged, since we had been dating for about a year, planned on getting engaged sometime soon anyway, and it would benefit us as we could get cheaper married housing next year (I'm a sophomore and she's a freshman). It was more so her idea than mine to get married way earlier than I planned (I planned on proposing next semester), and I already made a huge decision of moving across the country with her to go to uni with her (I dropped quite a bit of social groups and such because of it, and have been relying on really her for friends).

Ever since things have been different between us. She suffers from mental illness, such as PTSD from childhood trauma and sexual assault, so her depression intensified since last week. I thought it was all the stress of the engagement. Eventually she starts wanting to do things she typically doesn't want to do like go to the club, do harder drugs like LSD, etc. She used to be a pretty reserved and quiet girl (she did a lot of weed and was pretty sexually active in the past, but when we first started dating she was getting well past that), but since starting college and her roommates being what I would call ""e girls"" she seems to be getting influenced from them a lot, especially since there's been points where she won't go a night high on something (usually weed). Different interests developing, that's fine and all.

We go to a gay club nearby our university, and we're both pretty intoxicated. I'm on a combination of nicotine, weed, and a little bit of alcohol while she is **really** high on weed. She's grinding on me, making out, etc. all that stuff talking about how she wants to have sex with me when we go back to the room (which she shares).

We go back to the room and then the lights are turned off. She takes her breasts out and starts pushing them in my face, pushing my head on them etc. etc. all while doing graphic things to my crotch. I ask a few times if we can go further, she says no, but we keep on doing intense foreplay. Eventually I ask her to flip over after this and she sticks my (blank) in her (blank) and we go at it for a while, before she suddenly tells me to stop. The next morning she asks me to leave and tells me she does not want me around her while her and her friends do LSD, because I sexually assaulted her when she thought I was going to hug her.

I will say that's pretty scummy of me to do. After she told me that I kinda avoided her. We share a car, and initially after that incident she let me take it back to my place, then she asks for it. I was pretty certain we were on the verge of breaking up, so in the process, I took my Xbox and clothes from her room because I wasn't sure this was gonna end well. She was pissed from this from what I later learned because she thought I was being selfish, though her roommates helped me grab my shit and go. Later in the day they're on LSD, and she has a bad trip; she is crying and asks me over so I come; she tells me I better leave once she's sober because sober her sober self is mad at me, so I keep my distance from her. Again, she said later that she me to hug her at this point, but I was afraid she would get upset if I touched her due to the previous night's actions, so I just sit by her and watch everyone be high on LSD. Eventually I'm talking about how I have a job interview and how I need the car for it, then she kicks me out of her dorm because she thinks I only look for myself.

Later that night she's talking about how she wonders if we're a good couple; keep in mind we basically lived with one another up until this point, all of our friends thought we're a cute couple, we share a car (it's hers though) and a cat (she got it because ESA at colleges), and then says how her high self has decided to ""forgive"" me and ""move on."" The next day we go to the dining hall where she badgers me for being mentally ill, ""too dominate,"" and how I need help, and if I ever do what I did again she'd break up with me and get me arrested. Then that night we have sex.

After all this her ex (he lives back in our hometown, so it's not like he's nearby but still) that continually hits her up from time to time, mostly to hit on her, starts texting her and they start texting all the time about memes and all the like. Then my girlfriend goes on this rant about how she feels like she's walking on eggshells me with because she can't be ""open"" like talking to that guy "" as a friend"" and wanting to be a dancer at a nightclub or a stripper, and feels like she can't be open about her sexuality around me because I didn't want to be around her friends at a sex store looking for vibrators. Keep in mind my girlfriend has had a lot of bad dreams/fears she's told me about where she fears I'd go back to ***my*** ex, and after I asked her last night if she'd be ok if I started being friends with my ex again, she said she ""wouldn't care,"" which honestly I thought was horse crap.

Anyway, after all this, she still asks me to help her buy Halloween decorations and help keep her bank account over $0, all the while debating on whether if I care about her or not and how hurt she is.

We share a car, cat, basically all our friends, etc. and I honestly have no idea what to do. I feel trapped since I rely on her so much and the fact that the incident mentioned earlier occurred, and there's still over a month left in the semester before I could dip (the school is pretty expensive so in the long run I'd be saving money).

Should I stick through this? She described it as an ""extreme depressive episode"" even though she said the LSD helped more than any therapist (and refuses to go see one or take any medication), or should I bail? Or am I just being a horrible boyfriend? A lot of my friends have said that I need to get out of here, but after thinking about that a lot, I have realized I love her more than anything and it's gonna be extremely difficult to get past here.

Need advice/guidance, please.","Hi RA - I'm considering ending my relationship and I need advice because I don't know what's holding me back besides not wanting to hurt someone's feelings. We've been together almost a year. I feel as though my bf (29M) and I (31F) are in two completely different stages of life. When we started this relationship, I said to myself that I'd give him time. But time has passed and literally nothing has changed.

I work a normal office job 8:30am-5pm m-f, I have a 11 year old daughter, and I rent my own apartment (saving to buy something hopefully within the next 5 years). My life is pretty stable and routine. My bf works 2 nights a week as waiter, lives with his parents, and during the day he is a music producer. However, the music does not generate income because he has not played a show in almost a year. Over the past year, he complains constantly about his job and how he wants to get a new one, but never does it. He refuses to get out of the restaurant industry or work more hours a week. He makes little to no effort to play shows to generate income with his music. I don't see his life changing any time in the near future.

We've had conversations about the future, about what I want from a relationship (he said he wants the same things, stability, long term commitment, financial independence etc) but he hasn't done a single thing to change his life. I know that I have no say in what he does with his life and I shouldn't judge someone for being on a different path than me, but I don't think I want to continue a relationship with someone who does not make any effort to grow and become independent.

t3_dlpssh,My Fianc√© [29/m] broke it off with me [32/f] to work on anger issues... do I wait?,"Long story short, the past few weeks his anger has been pretty bad... like, seeing red over losing sunglasses or not being able to find a hat right away.


He's never gotten violent, and he's not angry to me, but he gets really beside himself and yells and cusses and gets pretty mad for a bit but i've been able to talk him down and calm him down and help him with whatever the problem is.


3 weeks ago something happened between he and his mom, and he lost it. wouldn't talk to me all day (but was talking to a friend of his, so I knew he was ok). come 7:30pm I get a text saying ""this relationship is over for me. i can't keep lying to myself, i know i need help and i can't get help when i'm always worrying about you. this is the hardest thing i've ever had to do, i'm sorry.""


come this past saturday, he finally called me after 2 weeks of no contact and told me to come get my things because seeing them everyday hurt him too much. phone call was about 45min, of him saying he knows he has an issue and needs therapy and needs help and that he still loves me, etc. so i go over there and he is BROKEN, crying the whole time... i've never seen someone look so sad and so lost. he wound up hugging me a few times, telling me he still loves me, telling me he needs to get the help and he is too toxic for a relationship right now and doesn't want to hurt me but needs the time apart to fix himself.


of course, i will wait. i tell him that, and he says ""but i don't know how long it'll take"", which i understand... but i'm not just gonna move on from the person i'm in love with.


is it stupid to wait? i feel like if i don't, i'm abandoning my person. engagement/marriage is about supporting and loving your partner through good times or bad, so i will wait... he said he hasn't drank in 2 weeks (not a huge drinker, but even a few beers i don't think it really does him any good) so i know he's making steps to try to better himself. i feel like if he really gives therapy a try, hopefully in a few months things will be better and he'll be back.

t3_dlsqdg,"I am a 23 F engaged to a 37 F, the constant nitpicking is ruining our relationship","We have been together for three  years. I pursued her because she is everything I look for in a woman. Intelligent, kind, genuine, beautiful. She is very career driven and extremely task oriented. We have lived together for about a year.

On the other hand, I‚Äôm very ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù and not so rigid. I get all my tasks done and I‚Äôm very driven also, but I don‚Äôt feel like things need to be done a ‚Äúspecific way‚Äù like my fianc√© does. She says she admires how carefree I am about the small stuff, however I am at my wits end with the constant nagging over what I think are trivial things.

For example:

When I park my career, my fianc√©e is constantly fearful I‚Äôm going to hit another car, she‚Äôs always giving me ‚Äúpointers‚Äù on how to park better. I‚Äôve never been in a car accident, or hit another car. She gets overwhelmed and frustrated whenever I park the car.

The other day I put up fairy lights in our backyard and she read the instructions on the box and questioned me for about 20 minutes about what we were going to do if it rained: I kept explaining that they were outdoor lights and I had the extension cord undercover but she was insistent that it was ‚Äúdangerous, but it looks really nice‚Äù. 


Last night I was hanging out our washing and when she saw it she nitpicked about how I should space out the washing more so it doesn‚Äôt smell. I‚Äôve never had smelly washing or issues of clothes not drying my entire life but she constantly feels the need to point out how I can do things ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. I.e. her way.

There have been times where the way that I wash dishes has been called into question. Sometimes when this happens I laugh because I find it so ridiculous. She got so frustrated that after scouring dishes from a dinner party I missed a slight amount of grease off a pan. She then proclaimed that ‚ÄúI just leave dishes dirty‚Äù.

We have argued endlessly about this, she believes that she is just trying to help me become better at things and instead it makes me feel infantilised and incapable; inadequate as a partner in our partnership. I have told her this and she says the things I do frustrate her because they can be done in a more efficient manner. As you can see by my writing, I go out of my way to do chores - but to absolutely no benefit to anyone else because I‚Äôm never praised - always getting ‚Äúcorrective training‚Äù absolutely nothing turns me off more than this.

We are both so trusting of each other, we give each other the right amount of space and attention, and sex life is great. 

We see each other twice a week which is why I think it works because on the 2 days (usually after 6 because that‚Äôs when I finish work)  we see each other we just wanna spend it with each other.

My bf has expressed interest in moving into my flat when I buy it and he‚Äôs offered to contribute to rent/mortgage repayments. My concern is that when we move out together it‚Äôs not gonna be the same and the time spent together isn‚Äôt going to be as special. Because we only see each other twice a week like we just wanna have sex as soon as we get into the bedroom, cuddle up watching movies and spend hours talking about our respective weeks. I feel like this just won‚Äôt happen because we‚Äôll see each other everyday. I love our routine and I feel it just won‚Äôt wanna change it (don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken kinda deal). 

For example, I know my boyfriend watches porn and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it as long as he doesn‚Äôt put porn and wanking before me. And when we see each other of course (well I‚Äôd like to think so) he just wants to have sex with me and I‚Äôm just worried that‚Äôll fizzle out too. Like I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll  come home one day wanting to have sex and he‚Äôd already had a wank and I know I‚Äôd take that personally.

Edit 1: I obviously love him and will I hope one day marry him I‚Äôm just wondering how other couples make the step and how you keep your relationship fresh (can‚Äôt think of a better word lol) and I of course I will  move out with him one day but I‚Äôm just not ready atm

Any advice would be appreciated

t3_dlspmm,Cannot regain trust in relationships nor find balance within myself anymore,"Sorry for the lengthy story. I've never been the jealous type. In fact I was always super loose about how non commital I was. I never wanted long relationships nor marriage. But then I got married under trying and tragic circumstances. I took that quite seriously as it was a once in a lifetime decision. The marriage was chaotic, turned abusive and took a turn for the worst- in every way. I transgressed my boundaries day to day because commitment has a promise I made to the other person in any condition and stayed until my life and others I knew were in physical danger. He had a slew of conditions, alcoholism, bi polar and split personality. 
In this time I still was able to focus on myself and work on my life. Eventually he broke me down to my base components and weakend me as a simple animal with no place left to run. I still carry this with me to this day. He also cheated on me and that was barely the worst of it all. He destroyed me.

After running away I found myself involved with a handsome guy who I just wanted to be with for fun but who forced me into a long term relationship and tried to make me part of his long-term plans. I can see all he wanted was to satisfy his ego. He played with my head and I knew it, I took him up on it and he kept on going on with his womanizing, and lacivious ways. He did not cheat but every day I found pictures of women, local ones in his feed. I found myself slowly losing the battle to my own decency and looking through his stuff and killing myself inside. He kept pushing to have a family non stop and be together forever. I felt it was bullshit all. the. way. through. I called him out on it yet stayed way too long for my mental health.

Leaving him was easily one of the best things I've ever done. He was manipulative, deceptive and sociopathic, he 'tested' me, confined me in his 'opinions of the world' and pressed daily to stay in this shitty relationship. 

I've been in better relationships, one where I know what respect means, and at one point in my life.. these two people respected me as well. I was treated well. where do I go wrong? Did I stay past all the red flags? Did I trust the person and not the actions? 
 for some reason, I couldn't say no anymore, I could not abandon the idea of things improving and that's a fight I was fighting for, maybe not even the person but the idea.

These days, I distrust all men and it is crippling, I am triggered all the time. I can't function at all in my daily life when I'm in a relationship and every guy seems partially evil to me. I saw the good and when it was bad, it was a nightmare. I can't stop generalizing men and I can't believe that any of them dont have supreme narcissistic desires. I saw two people literally transform before my eyes. One was overt, the other was blatantly living or wanting to live in two realities and show me one face. I saw it all
I don't know what to do. I don't know how to give anyone else a chance anymore without seeing their faces on the/a new person. Scarier yet, to see their faces on my own and knowing I've kept the worst bits of them despite not wanting to. I struggle to find the carefree person I was once, the monster I've become and ever looking at anyone with trust ever again, seething with jealousy. 
I know therapy therapy blah blah blah. I want to hear some insight. Anyone gone through loss of identity with this or new malice for people overall? How did/do you deal with it?

t3_dlsp5g,How should I feel? Am I a rebound or someone he may genuinely like?,"So Its my first time actually ""talking"" to a guy, and I had a huge crush on the certain guy last year. As it turns out he likes me too! So I feel like I should be feeling different emotions.

Please hear this story out:

I've liked him for about a year in the grand scheme of things. Last year I hurt myself by liking him because I knew he liked someone else, I tried so hard to stop liking him so much but it's like my heart didn't want to give up on him. It was the weirdest thing because I've never actually liked someone before. So it broke me knowing he liked someone else. Throughout the summer I pretty much got over him or at least was trying to, my heart still missed him but I told myself it was just infatuation.

Main part lol:

Last month he asked a girl to hoco in front of  our entire grade. And she rejected him. I felt really upset but I didn't want to hurt him even more so I just kept to myself and didn't try and show him my feelings, although we had been close for a while beforehand. 
Fast forward to now, we have been ""talking"" for 22 days. I can't help but feel like a rebound and that hurts a lot, especially considering how much I liked him in the past, and how much I do now. He's super affectionate with me but I feel like everyone will think I'm a rebound at school or judge me for liking him. I must seem like a pretty awful person for feeling this way. It's not like I don't like him I'm just so afraid of him not actually liking me and having myself look so dumb. He compliments me all the time is super into PDA but is he just using me for attention?

 But honestly...I just wish he liked me before he liked her. I've told him about how I feel before and he said that I wasnt a rebound but what else am I suppose to think? He just got over her that quick? Is that possible to do? I don't know what I'm doing..

I really have no one that really understands my feelings. My parents would get mad at me for thinking like this, none of my friends want to listen to me talking about my personal life..but I'm hoping someone may help me, if not then this was a good way to let some of my feelings out haha

t3_dlsosv,"I don't like the way i used to argue (maybe toxic), and already decided to change, but for some reason i need to understand more","**TLDR**: I used to argue in a certain way, after thinking about it, i realized whether it is toxic or not, i don't want to do it this way anymore because it can be hurtful. I already made my choice, but for some reason, i have a urge to understand this a little better. Specially from people that left a toxic relationship in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Names and ages were changed. I'm in my thirties, all my SO were around my age.

&amp;#x200B;

Before starting, i know it was not fair to expect someone to argue the way i expected. I regret doing it, and it was a honest mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alice**

I have been in a long relationship with Alice (more than 7 years together), where we used to argue in a certain way when there were feelings involved. It was never a problem (or maybe it was but she never told me, and i failed to see it myself. We also broke up for unrelated reasons). I know every person is different, but since it worked well, i never thought about it until now. I thought a little empathy lead naturally to this (which is wrong, i know)

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever **A** did or say something that hurt the feelings of **B**, **B** ""deserved"" an explanation and an apology. Using a tone of voice that showed negative emotions, making questions in an accusatory way or saying hurtful things was ""understandable"" and forgiven by **A**

&amp;#x200B;

We never talked about it, it was just how we argued. Every argument was different but in general, they looked like this: I do something that hurts Alice, she becomes visible upset and maybe say something hurtful. I apologize (sometimes immediately, just for doing something that hurt her feelings) after that, i try to understand the problem and apologize again (this time because i understood the problem and how it made her feel), and finally i explain the reason i did what i did. She then apologizes for reacting the way she reacted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jane**

Few years after things ended with Alice, i met Jane.

&amp;#x200B;

I never questioned the way i used to argue, until i realized how Jane was reacting. She gave no explanations, sometimes an apology that never sounded honest, and at some point she started crying. Seeing her cry broke my heart, so i automatically ended the argument each time, and moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while she told me the way i argue is hurtful, and it reminds her of her ex (toxic relationship, ended many years ago) and she gets anxious when we argue, which i understand, and explains why she reacted like that.

&amp;#x200B;

She also told me that when I'm upset, i **need** to make the other person feel bad, crying or at least visible sad (which is not true, it may help me not feel upset anymore, but it breaks my heart) and this also reminds her of her ex.

&amp;#x200B;

I think she is talking about the arguments where i didn't get what i thought it was a honest apology and no explanation at all. So i demanded both in a way i regret now, but before thinking about the way i was used to argue it felt like a reasonable thing to do. We also had a few arguments where i was very hurt and made questions in an accusatory way (i also regret this)

&amp;#x200B;

Is Jane analyzing my behavior and being extra careful to avoid being in a toxic relationship again? Or maybe they way i used to argue is just toxic?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way once i started questioning the way i argue, i realized i don't want to do it this way anymore, but i just would like to have a better understand of this.",relationship_advice
t3_dlso97,I (32F) don't feel desired by my boyfriend (30M),"This thing has been bugging me for a few months now and it's become pretty painful so I can't ignore it anymore.
We've been together for 3 years now, we get along great, like what one thinks, other does but the sex thing is the only thing that is not as good as the rest.
We have sex few times a week, and to be clear, that's fine by me. I'm not asking for more, I'm missing the flirting part. Our sex is now a routine, we go to bed, he scrolls on his phone and then asks me if I want to have sex. 
We barely kiss, just small kiss when we get home from work, he mostly touches me just to tickle my nose or ears, so nothing sexually connected. 
I miss him looking at me with desire, like he used to do. I miss having spontaneous sex, I miss him grabbing my ass as he passes me by, I miss those kind of things. 
And I've been trying talking for a few times, he says he understands but nothing changes much. He says he loves me and thinks I'm supersexy but he just doesn't show me. And I'm getting frustrated and I know I'm probably getting annoying.
Also, I tried to bring the old spark.
For example, last week I tried to spice things up and I sent him a naked selfie in black lace lingerie while he was at work and his reaction was: ""wow, you look really nice"". Nothing that he thinks I'm hot, how he would like to see me like that when he gets home,etc. And he actually used to ask for my pictures, we were sexting etc. 
I tried talking to him later that night that his comment seemed distant, and he became defensive, like what more do I want, me being sensitive again, what else could he possibly say. 
I also tried dressing up in sexy lingerie and started kissing him and he was lost, like he was confused, didn't know what to do and asked me does that mean we have to have sex now? Any time I make some sexual reference, he's like: ""oh no, you're horny again"".
I don't now what to do anymore, I feel really hurt, now I'm losing my will to have sex, I sometimes even feel used after we have sex. And in everything else we get along so nicely, I don't want our relationship to fail because of this.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsn9y,Almost everyone thinks my boyfriend is a pedophile because I look young and it started to ruin our relationship,"He looks like 30, while I look like I'm 12. In fact we're both 24.

Whenever we go to the cinema/zoo/anywhere for a date people stare and at least 2-3 people come up to him and tells him he's sick and shouldn't do these kind of things with a kid. It's annoying, so we don't go out much, but I don't really mind.

The problem is : last week someone told him that it doesn't matter how old I am, if I look like I'm 12 he is a pedophile, cause he sleeps with someone who looks like a minor. Since then we haven't...and he said he doesn't know if he can. Or what if he really is a pedophile. I know he isn't, lookswise I'm not even his type (we were friends for 2 years before we got together, that's how I know).

I don't know how to help him, it seems like everything I say just make things worst. I'd appreciate any advise, even if it's just a guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I do get confrontational about it and I would like to understands what's going on in his head as I got no idea and I can't say more that ""just ignore it, they know nothing"". He said I don't understand what's his problem and I really don't and tat's my real problem.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsn6h,How do I (22F) deal with my mother (52F) crossing boundaries?,"I (22F) have issues with my mom‚Äôs (52F) boundaries at work, seeing as though we work together. Previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlsbxj/how_do_i_22f_deal_with_working_with_a_family/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) about her. But these issues have extended to my entire life since before I started working there. Feel free to help a girl out about tips on dealing with her at work over there. BUT here is some stuff I would love to get advice on:

*1. Social media privacy:*

She likes to share personal accomplishments/milestones about me without asking first. (i.e I had a bat mitzvah as an adult and when I got my new job). I like to announce if/when I‚Äôm ready. Last time she told me I didn‚Äôt like it, she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù 

She listed my close friend in the Facebook post about my new job because she got a new job at the same time. My friend wasn‚Äôt telling people yet. 

She posted my flight number when I went on my first solo flight years ago. Wouldn‚Äôt remove it until I refused to show her pictures of my trip. 

Posted private baby photos before the parents (my brother, her son) were ready. 

And MORE. 

*2. Bedroom privacy:*

For safety (special needs sibling) we got indoor doors that can be unlocked from the outside.  She walks into my locked bedroom without knocking CONSTANTLY. 

I am a very neat person. My stuff is organized the way I need it. She reorganizes so nothing is on the floor or table, etc. and shoves it in closets. Claims she was organizing, really just made it a lot worse. I lost $150 shoes this way, spent 45 minutes crying while looking for them. Don‚Äôt worry, found them. 

Takes my clothes without asking. We have very different body types. She stretches shirts out in the stomach and I stretch shirts out in the breast area. Ruins $20 shirts that I pay for. 

Demanded that I throw away my old clothes and replace them with expensive ones. Can‚Äôt seem to explain to her that I would be happy to, if she pays. Otherwise, I‚Äôm glad to wait until I save up. 

She does, however, go through my things to monitor what I purchase. While she wants me to get new clothes, if I do, I get yelled at for wasting money. 

*3. Chronically makes fun of my health habits:*

Look, I‚Äôm pretty healthy. I eat OK and exercise. I go to the gym and take yoga classes twice a week. I hiked all the way down and up the Grand Canyon last year. She constantly calls me fat and belittles any of my health goals. If I eat one cookie, she constantly tells people that I‚Äôve been eating cookies all week. 

She‚Äôs on a new diet. Apparently I can‚Äôt eat any simple sugar EVER since she can‚Äôt. But in a month or two, I can‚Äôt eat any fat EVER since she won‚Äôt so whatever. 

*4. She doesn‚Äôt fix anything once I tell her I am hurt by her:*

I have brought all of these up using wording like ‚ÄúI feel.‚Äù As in ‚ÄúI feel upset when you take my clothes without asking.‚Äù I‚Äôve also thrown in the whole ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary inappropriate to monitor my activity at work.‚Äù 

Usually ends in:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your mom, I care about you‚Äù

‚ÄúI pay for you to live here‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, pay rent‚Äù * doesn‚Äôt accept rent *

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I have many more things that I haven‚Äôt mentioned in this post. I don‚Äôt want to be an ungrateful daughter, housemate, or whatever. They do let me live rent free. They pay for my food and various insurances. They are the ones who pushed me to move back in and refuse to take money from me. I‚Äôm super grateful. I do all the remaining chores (they have someone to do most of them for us, whether I‚Äôm living there or not). I go pick up the groceries, take my sibling to school/doctors appointments, I cook dinner, etc. 

My personal solution is to pay them rent (covers living, utilities, food, amenities) and put a lock on my door. No dice. Not allowed. Moving out is financially not an option.

t3_dlpnok,Mismatched libido issues between me (F20) and partner (21M) of 2 years,"Hi Reddit, 

I have been dating my partner for just over 2 years. In the beginning our sex life was amazing. Multiple times a day, adventurous with positions and it was just great.  

Then around the 1 year mark it just started going down on my end. I was stressed, I had some health issues which I'm still dealing with even now. 
- iron deficiency 
- anemic 
- vit d deficiency
Just to name a few. 

My partner has a much higher libido than me and I take full responsibility for my libido as it is based on my health the way it is right now. 

He understands this but sometimes he tries to initiate sex, I would say 80% of the time I just am not up to it. 
I can see the annoyance in his face and then he goes all quiet or gets up to do his own thing when we were just nicely cuddling on the couch or something. 

I don't know what I can do to make myself want to have sex more because it honestly drains me to even think about it and the way my health is going it just is way too much for my body. 

Okay! This is long, sorry! I guess my main question/advice ask is

t3_dlslni,Boyfriend avoidant and is sabotaging the relationship.,"I (25f) and my boyfriend (30m) have been together for almost a year. Initially our relationships started out as polyamorous. I had another partner and we opened our relationship and that‚Äôs when I started dating my current boyfriend. The other relationship is over now and I have told my current boyfriend that I really want to develop a deep connection with him, so I‚Äôm basically going back to being monogamous. 

He has a lot of childhood trauma from being emotionally neglected, and he seems to pendulate between being anxiously attached and avoidant. I also have trauma from neglect, but the neglect i received was much more subtle and i didn‚Äôt even realize it was neglect until a therapist pointed it out. My parents are very controlling and they would try to manipulate me to do things they think are best for me. So their love has always been very conditional. I have an anxious attachment style that stems from this, and I‚Äôm constantly worried that people will stop loving me if I do something they don‚Äôt like. 

A few months ago, when I was still dating both partners, my boyfriend that I‚Äôm still with told me that he can‚Äôt handle being poly anymore. It was a very emotional discussion and we were both in ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve love‚Äù mode. I ended up breaking up with him, because I thought that‚Äôs what he was saying he wanted. I thought he was telling me he wanted to break up because he couldn‚Äôt handle me being in a relationship with someone else. Up to this point in the relationship, my boyfriend had been extremely open with me. He was able to be totally vulnerable with me  and really leaned into the connection. I loved it. But it was one-sided. I didn‚Äôt really ever let him in because I was very uncomfortable with vulnerability and I would rather meet his needs and make him feel loved. In retrospect, it was very codependent and almost like a parent-child relationship. And actually, when I broke up with him, it caused him to feel like he was literally, physiologically dying. His therapist said it‚Äôs something that sometimes happens with people who have a lot of trauma from infancy. It seems that he attached to me in a way that he was never able to attach to his mother. So I was sort of a combination mother and girlfriend. And when I broke up with him, he relived that trauma. So in short, I really fucked him up. 

A few days later, after a ton of talking to our respective friends and therapists, we ended up getting back together. I guess it took a breakup for me to realize how much I did want to invest in the relationship. And ever since then, I‚Äôve been the one being totally vulnerable. I‚Äôve allowed him to see me in emotional states that I‚Äôve NEVER allowed people to see me in. And he‚Äôs been great about supporting me in that. But since I hurt him so badly when we broke up, he is most definitely holding back from me, and I can feel it all the time. Our relationship is still very playful and loving, but he has been able to open up to me, but I can always tell that he‚Äôs holding part of himself back. It almost feels like he‚Äôs trying to be the caretaker for me now. But I don‚Äôt want a caretaker; I want a partner. 

So the other night, we had a pretty big fight. I mentioned that I still haven‚Äôt told me parents about breaking up with my other partner. They were NOT supportive of my being polyamorous and they practically hated the partner I broke up with because he is very outspoken about politics and they butt heads over that. When my boyfriend learned that I hadn‚Äôt told my parents yet, he immediately shut down emotionally. He thought it meant that I thought he was replaceable somehow, or that I didn‚Äôt care about him. I tried to explain that it‚Äôs not about him, it‚Äôs about the complicated relationship I have with my parents. I can‚Äôt handle the judgment and ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù from them about the failed polyamorous relationship. But he was in defense mode at this point and he said some hurtful things to me about how I‚Äôm just not owning my decisions. He even sort of laughed at me like I was silly for it. Sometimes he‚Äôll try to out-trauma me. Since my trauma is less obvious, my family does appear to be ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù especially to my boyfriend, who has never felt love of any kind from his own family. He reacted so coldly to me and it set off the anxiety I have of being loved if I do something wrong. I ended up having a panic attack right there in front of him, which I had never done before. He held me and tried to comfort me but it wasn‚Äôt very comforting considering the emotionless state he was in. 

I know this defense state he is in is because he is afraid of losing me. He even told me that‚Äôs what it is. I‚Äôve explained in every possible way that I can that i love him and I want this relationship with him. I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do because right now I‚Äôm being very anxiously attached by asking for reassurance and getting clingy when he can‚Äôt give it to me, and he is being avoidant by dissociating and avoiding showing me how he feels. He said he‚Äôs so cknvinced that I‚Äôm going to leave because he‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to love‚Äù and everyone leaves eventually. But that‚Äôs not what I want.

I feel like I‚Äôm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll be able to tolerate being shut out from his emotional world. It hits me directly in my own trauma of feeling unworthy of love. The last thing I want to do is leave him, but at this point he‚Äôs sabotaging himself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Is there any way for me to help him feel safe in the relationship without putting my own self worth on the line?

I feel like in some ways maybe it is because your partner went through it once and realizes it must just not be working, and can come to terms with it more?

I am aware this issue probably is situational, but I personally think it can be easier just because the person ending it has more confidence that it is over, since they gave it another shot, there is less guilt that you could be ending it for the wrong reasons. I also believe that it isn't just a bomb that is being dropped on you both and that it can be understood a bit more.",relationship_advice

t3_dlsj51,Is friendship still possible with the girl (26) who rejected me (30)?,"I had wanted to become a celibate Buddhist monk (still do), so I had purposely not chase girls. Unfortunately, hormones and undisciplined thoughts made me fall in love with a girl. 

We went for a youth camp together, a hiking retreat. Location in Malaysia. 

She's a Buddhist too, and knows of my monkhood intention and on Valentine's this year, after knowing her for 1 year+ I confessed via text. There was no reply for 3 days, by which I take it to mean rejection, and wished to confirm it. She texted back that we will always just remain as friends. I replied that I am glad, for I still have no intention to marry. 

I tried then to abandon all my feelings for her, it's still an ongoing process. However, just last weekend, we went together on a group trip to another state for donating food to monks. During the 2 days trip, I tried my best to talk to others, not stick to her, but end up still got to talk to her quite a bit more than anyone else as my cravings are still there. I sensed a sort of aversion reaction from her that she's less responsive compared to a normal friend, but maybe that's my craving speaking for wanting more reaction from her. She still smiles at me if I smile at her. 

I dunno if even remaining as friends is possible anymore if I seem to be just hurting her by interacting with her. Maybe it's that I hurt her by she thinking that she hurt me if she becomes more warm to me, it would rekindle my crush on her. 

She also has frequently updated status on her whatsapp. Today, some of the status is: cutting people out of my life doesn't mean I hate them, it means I respect myself. 

I previously asked her on status relating to relationships and she said it's for a friend, nothing to do with us. 

So what should I do? Should I reply to her status update to say I am sorry I seem to hurt you, that I am trying my best to reduce and abandon the residual love attachment I had for her? (I am a conservative romantic who prefers to get a girlfriend for marriage material, not for casual fling, so the falling in love is deep.) If she wants, we can just not interact. Or just ignore her the next time we meet? 

Sorry, my head may not be very objective here and I suck at relationships, never been in one before. So I need outsiders advice.",relationship_advice

t3_dlsifa,My boyfriend cheated at the start of the relationship,"The tittle quite sums up the story, we hooked up on november last year and slowly fell into a relationship around December, around that time we had agreed this would end soon as I(F19) was leaving for school in February. 

However by February we were both too attached and decided we'd travel every other weekend to see each other and keep the relationship alive, slowly we fell for the other and the relationship started to become quite domestic, to the point we've sort of talked about living together if it weren't because neither can move to the others city. We're 11 months this Thursday, and haven't ever fought for more than a day, every problem being solved within the same day and often in less than an hour. Almost perfect relationship with the ocassional issue here and there. 

It all brings us to yesterday, I'm staying with him(M23) because I'm on a small break and we went out on the weekend, he gave me his phone to search some photos and a video I asked him to send to me and I ended up stumbling upon some compromising videos. 

Two with sexual contents with a girl that's obviously not me (dated December 16th and January 23rd) and some other casual videos (girl recording him while he does homework and she teases him at home, and same girl recording him while teasing him at a restaurant both dated somewhere in December). 

I immediately showed him what I found, but couldn't really ask because of ugly crying. 

He kept apologizing over and over again. 

In the end, I think I'm gonna forgive him, after all by those dates we weren't really serious and it wasn't supposed to last more than a few months. 

But I don't know how to shake the feeling of hurt and betrayal, like I got really invested from the very beginning and he didn't. And it hurts. It hurts so much. 

Even with that I don't want to end the relationship, as I have no reasons to believe he's done anything since I left for school and started traveling (I feel the relationship for serious by that time) and he doesn't behave as a cheater, idk how to explain that bit. 

He's since deleted all of them, and he seemed to not even know what those videos were. And, even if I sound stupid, I still trust him. And I want to put it behind and forget about it for the sake of our relation. 

I just want advice regarding how to put it behind me, and not feel so hurt about those videos and what they mean.",relationship_advice
t3_dlph37,Was my ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù healthy?,"hello! i need advice on something.

over a year ago i had a friend that i wanted to go out with. she did some of the following things and i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs justified or not to be healthy-

she insisted to walk far behind me because she said she has friends in the neighborhood and doesn‚Äôt want people to think we were together. i expressed that it hurt me and when i tried to walk by her, she wouldn‚Äôt let me.

she would tell me for weeks she wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to date. eventually she said no but still came over. she told me she didn‚Äôt want to cuddle anymore. i still wanted to, and she would cuddle but then tell me later ‚Äúno more‚Äù and put it on me like it wasn‚Äôt a two-way thing. she would even initiate it sometimes. it left me confused. people in my life told me it was a ‚Äúpush-pull‚Äù dynamic. she would do one thing and do another.

she had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that got after her for hanging out with me. when he found out i gave her a hickey, he went OFF on her cussing her out saying he should‚Äôve been her first for everything. but this guy already did tons of stuff with other girls. he was controlling and toxic. she insisted that he‚Äôs usually not like that and she sent him paragraphs to talk to her again. he talked shit behind her back about her with her ex too.

i told her i wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to her anymore if she lets this toxic person back into her life (i don‚Äôt want to be friends with people who lavish in toxic relationships). when she started talking to him again i cut it off.

i do feel terrible for trying to kiss her one time. she said no and i was persistent, but then i laid off. i felt bad for being persistent for wanting to kiss her that moment.

she would get in a lot of drama. i felt confused because i felt like i was getting mixed signals (sent me pics once, would cuddle with me then shove me away the next).

before i cut her off she ‚Äúaccused‚Äù me of forcing her to cuddle with her, even though i usually initiated, she initiated before too, and left me confused. i thought sure i was persistent but never forceful, i thought respected boundaries.

months later she said she needed me to help her because she was going through a panic attack, so i was there for her, then she just stopped responding and didn‚Äôt care for me.

am i just being irrational? was this stuff justified and healthy? i‚Äôm left with a lot of uncertainty and uncomfortable and wanted a second opinion.

One of those friends house I've been to a lot seeing as we are actually neighbours. 
He has two sisters one of with I'll call C (F25)
I've always had a good friendly relationship with C, but about half a year ago it turned into a crush.
C had a boyfriend and obviously the big Sis of my friend. So I never intended to even make a move. And just tried to ignore it.

Skip ahead a good 3 months to now still got a crush that just kept growing and she broke up with her boyfriend around two months ago and has been through a couple of dates.
A few days ago I went to a party and she was there to. We talked and she actually confessed to me about having feelings for me that started when she was still with her now ex.

The post is getting long so I'll get to the point.

t3_dlsevt,How do I (F20) get my boyfriend (M20) to stop being a doormat and start challenging me more?,"This probably sounds like a weird situation but hear me out. 

I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for a little over a month. We‚Äôre both in college and have been friends for a while and started seeing each other a few months ago. I feel like he has always liked me more than I like him.. I was the one who was hesitant to date at first because of bad breakups in the past and I frankly wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked him enough to date. He finally asked me out and I said yes and it‚Äôs been great ever since. He is the kindest person I know and would literally do anything for me but I feel like that is sort of the problem. I feel like something is missing in our relationship and I think it‚Äôs that he is -too- nice. I know it sounds weird and ungrateful because a lot of girls my age are in the complete opposite situation. But I just wish he gave me more pushback sometimes. We‚Äôve never been in an argument, not even in the slightest. I‚Äôm the kind of person who has always been into douche bags/fuck boys and he is the first guy I‚Äôve been with who isn‚Äôt one. But it‚Äôs not even that I want him to become an asshole, I just want him to challenge me more. He‚Äôs told me before that he doesn‚Äôt think he could ever be mad at me, that I could be mad at him but unless I did something extreme like cheat on him he could never be mad at me. 

How do I get him to be less of a doormat in our relationship? I want things to be a little more spicy (for lack of better words) like I want to feel a spark or have some sort of mystery‚Äî because right now I feel like I could tell him the earth is flat and he would believe me.",relationship_advice
t3_dlseb0,My (20/F) BF (20/M) has been living off of me for over 9 months *long post*,"My bf ran away from his parents December 2018 (a longish story there), and had to drop out uni. At that point we had been close friends for 2.5 years and dating for 1-2 years (another long story). We've been living together for as long as we've been friends, so I know him, his personality, and habits pretty well. In the simplest terms, he's a lazy cunt who tends to get away with everything. We've planned for his running away somewhat, and knew that it wouldn't be easy, especially since I live alone and my parents doesn't know anything.  
For the first 3 months, I let him slack off, but he just kept pushing back whatever schedule I throw at him. He didn't have a complete and updated resume until end of March 2019. He finally started looking at jobs in April/May. It lasted maybe a month before he stopped cuz no one replied. During this entire time, we'd been living off of my living expenses from my parents and my part-time job. I had to go home during the summer and all he did, other than gaming and more gaming, was help us move... And he didn't even unpack. Actually, 1. his natural state of being is just gaming, random gaming social group, reddit/imgur, and sleep 2. Moving wasn't a huge deal since he looked at like three places and picked the one with the chillest owner and he got help from our friends as well 3. Nothing except his necessities (laptop, blanket, towel, and some clothes) was unpacked for a whole month. Anyway, so after I come back, which was the day before school starts again, I had to unpack, get groceries (since he ate either frozen food or simple sandwiches), and get ready for school.  
I'm currently in my last year of my degree, so I'm quite busy: school, part time, clubs/other activities, and yet my bf doesn't do any chores unless it's about half a day after asking him 8 times. Even worse is that he thinks his schedule is of higher priority than mine. For example, he would rather have me take the transit for 45+mins single way to go to work just so he could drive to his DnD sessions that are 2 times a week (we share one car and he doesn't have bus pass, also that's the only time he ever goes out of our place). I started volunteering today, which coincides with DnD, so he made me drop him off early at the DnD place before I go to the volunteering place, which is not on the way at all.  
On top of everything, he is still unemployed. Last week, I made him an ultimatum: he is to give up either pc/video games or DnD until he finds a job. Last week, he got out of it by looking for job for half an hour. This week, he got out of it by arguing that I said one particular game as opposed to all games. 
I'm so tired of this. I love him so much, and I know he does love me, but this is absolute bs. Every time I try something, either he shrugs it off, or retaliate against me with something worse. None of our friends have any way of dealing with it either. What can I do?

Tl;dr Bf is a couch potato who works me as a slave, and still haven't found a job after 'trying' for 9 months even though he's financially independent of his parents",relationship_advice
t3_dlse9r,Should I (M16) stick with a her (F16) or should I end it here rather than draw it out?,"I‚Äôm dating someone I never would‚Äôve expected to and honestly it still blows my mind I could be dating her. Basically cutting right to the meat, our relationship is starting to really lose focus. We‚Äôve gone from seeing each other once a week or every other week to not doing anything for just over a month. She‚Äôs moving, and she‚Äôs incredibly excited to leave our town as it isn‚Äôt quite the biggest for a city girl like herself. So I feel like I‚Äôm left here already all alone and it‚Äôs really taking a toll on me mentally. In the little fragments of time in which I see her (passing periods) she rarely acknowledges my existence and it really hurts not being able to speak that much with her at all. We try and chat online as much as possible but she‚Äôs said she isn‚Äôt prioritizing our relationship. Often when I ask if she‚Äôs available after school she says she can‚Äôt or she‚Äôs busy but sometimes she goes and hangs out with other people on the same day. I know I‚Äôm definitely clingy and the reason behind that is that my ex started seeing another guy near the end of our relationship and ended up leaving me for him. I‚Äôm not trying to make an excuse or anything here I just want any relevant information to be present. She also cannot take a hint as to my emotions. There are some times where I‚Äôll be down and I‚Äôll let her know I really need a hug or affection and she ends up basically ignoring me all the same. Often in lunch another couple we‚Äôre friends with will often point out I look in the dumps and she doesn‚Äôt really care about it.

TLDR: My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt prioritize my relationship, is moving soon and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge me in really any scenario anymore. Am I warping this in the wrong direction, or is this really just not a relationship suited for me?

Also please don‚Äôt disregard this due to age, I understand I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt fully grasp the intricacies of relationships but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsdi1,I (21F) confused about my boyfriend(21M) and best friend (21F) after our breakup,"This is a very emotionally confusing situation for me and am looking for external input/insight because I'm not sure if I'm justified in how I am currently feeling. 

I (21F) broke up with my boyfriend (21M) about 2 months ago. He is truly an incredible person but we went through a prolong rough spot where he acted in a hurtful way towards me that I just couldn't recover from. I felt immensely guilty about breaking up with him despite knowing it was the right decision for me, and this compounded with the fact that he received a lot of sympathy from both my friends and family post-breakup. 

I turned to my best friend (21F) to help me through this really complicated time even though I was having trouble expressing my feeling about the breakup. I was still in contact with my ex during this time because I was not being firm with my boundaries and felt very responsible for his emotions. He would ask to talk every single day and tell me how miserable he was and how I was the best thing that had ever happened to him and the guilt just piled up. I asked him again and again to please find a friend he could talk to other than me and encouraged him to go to counseling.

 It eventually came up that he had been talking to my best friend and that she was helping him through the breakup too. I felt really betrayed and when I brought it up with my best friend she said that she didn't want to tell me because she didn't want me to think she wasn't on my side.  I pretended like I was okay with it because I just wanted my ex to finally get help but it was really confusing. I felt like I couldn't really trust her with my feelings about the breakup because she was helping my ex through the same stuff and I felt like I didn't really have anyone truly on my side. She promised me she wouldn't tell him things that we talked about, but she would tell me things that he said so I just wasn't sure what would get back to him. My ex told me that my best friend expressed to him that she wished we would get back together, which just made me feel so awful and guilty. 

I am just feeling really confused and upset about the entire situation. I would have never tried to help a friend's ex  because I feel like that would be a conflict of interest and would be hurtful to my friend, but I'm not sure if it's inappropriate or not because my best friend was just trying to help out my ex.

t3_dlsd1p,My roommate (21f) got so angry she screamed at me (21F) but I'm not even really sure why,"Sorry for the length of the post in advance.

My roommate (F21) lets call her T, and I (F21) were getting ready to go to a party. We've been best friends since childhood and always ask each other for advice on what to wear, makeup, hairstyles, etc. We're both pretty adventurous with clothes and like dressing up, wearing things that make us feel attractive. I put on a really tight risqu√© crop top, and asked her if it was appropriate.  She made a disgusted face at me, but said it looked okay. I am really insecure about my body so this hurt and I was worried that it was too much, I looked fat, blah blah blah, the general insecurities. I just threw on a coat over it and decided that I liked it and if I felt judged I would just zip up my coat. So she gets ready, I tell her she looks great and we meet up with another friend, lets call them B, to buy alcohol and head to the party. 

At first, it was a great time. I getting tipsy, but by the time I had finished my cup, T was on her 4th or 5th and really drunk. She started saying passive-aggressive comments about my appearance, like backhanded compliments. I just laughed them off because she was drunk. Then the cops showed up, we're obviously over 21, but I knew there was a few 19 year olds there so the house owner's wanted everyone to be quiet and stay put. My friends and I were in a bedroom and T was angry saying she wanted to leave. She was snapping at B and I claiming we are always mean to her when she can do whatever she wants. The owners kept telling her to please be quiet and she could leave after the cops left. She left the room and I went to a different bedroom with my friends who lived there. At this point everyone was drunk and we were having heart-to-hearts about how much we enjoyed being friends with each other. I've always felt unwanted and this really made my night. T came back in, and seemed in a better mood and we danced and socialized with the few others in the bedroom. The cops finally left and T got angry again for some unknown reason, but mentioned she was annoyed that I was talking to boys (our mutual friends) and she couldnt find one that liked her. B and I told her to maybe socialize more and that she didn't need guys to like her but said she was leaving. B and I were still having fun so we said we would meet her back at home. 

 The party dies down a bit, and its just B, 2 other friends, and I in the backyard. We were having a conversation about relationships when T comes back. She sits down next to me, and joins in. At some point in the conversation, I bring up how I'm casually seeing my ex, and how I don't know whats going to happen between us. T gets so pissed and keeps saying he's bad for me, an jerk, I would be better off single. I explain that even though I've been upset by him in the past, we were both equally unhealthy to each other and are trying to fix that. She starts yelling that I'm wrong I'm wrong, and I ask her to please explain why because I don't understand why she's so angry about it. Her response is that nobody supports her talking to her ex (also I won't get into it, but her ex was really really bad to her). I *never* told her not to talk to him and I point that out. She agrees with me but is still super mad at yells that she's going home. 

B and I head to my home about an hour later, at which point T has been waiting for us. (Side note: B lives down the street from us, but isn't a roommate). My ex calls me right as I get home and asks me to come over. That annoys T so much and she goes off about how I'm toxic to live with, screaming at me. I still don't know why and I get angry back trying to understand, and she brings up bills. We split all utilities but she has been claiming I owe her for internet. I've been trying to explain for weeks that internet is way less than gas and electricty (which are under my name) and it doesn't make sense to send her what I owe for internet when she will just have to send it back plus more for the bills she owes me. She hasnt ever understood this so that day at work I had written down the math showing how much we each owed for each bill and subtracting what I owed her for internet from what she owes me for the rest. Then she says that I am self-destructive bc of my ex (I have struggled with an eating disorder since highschool), but I point out it's been way before my ex and I even met and shes knows this. At this point she screams she's moving out and I am terrible and need to be ""taken down a notch"". This is all a surprise to me since we've been best friends forever. I found out from mutual friends that both T AND B have been claiming I made a spreadsheet of every little thing she owes me (2 dollars for beer, 3 for toilet paper, 5 for food), when this is not the case AT ALL, and was only for utilities.

I didnt talk to her for a couple days and yesterday she came up to me and apologized for being mean for no reason. How do I prevent this in the future? I keep feeling like maybe my body language or something is saying that I'm stuck-up or have a better than you attitude. The thing is, this isn't the first time this happened to me. A couple years ago another roommate of mine screamed at me and called me a barrage of insults for kissing my boyfriend at a party and ""rubbing it in her face"". I don't know why this keeps happening and feel like I'm the common denominator.

t3_dlf7h8,How do I(23F) make peace with the fact that I'll be forever alone without worrying other people?,"Up until now, I have never dated/been in a relations/or even been asked out. Before it was because I was too busy with school and being not dirt poor to care, and I just thought that if someone would really like me it would happen. Clearly that didn't work out lol.

Right now, I'm not poor anymore and saved a lot of money. I have a job I like and gym 5 times a week. I solo travel and hike a lot among other things. Basically what I'm saying is that I think I'm in a good place already, but it seems like dating still isn't a thing for me.

I have tried though before. I've asked guys out myself but they all ghosted me and slowly faded out that a first date just never happened. It never really bothered me until recently when I met with my friends, and I noticed that they all, at some point. have dated or seen someone. Even those that said they were aromantic and the ones that didn't actively find anyone.

This just made me really sad and disappointment with myself because like what's wrong with me?? Am I just that unlikeable that I haven't so much as met someone who would give me the time of day? At this point, I've accepted that there are some people who just never find anyone. Sucks, but it's out of my hands.

I understand that my circumstances also make it near impossible to meet anyone. I work from home so obviously I don't meet people and tbh, I don't have the guts to try dating apps because I don't think I'm pretty or interesting enough for them. But it's whatever I guess. What I'm asking is how do I learn to accept my perpetual singleness without coming off as sad or something. I don't actively exude sad and depressed thankfully haha but as I get older, I think I'll just appear lonelier and that would probably just end up worrying my friends and mom.

tl;dr  
Never dated. Tried it, failed. Am almost certain I'll be alone. How do I accept my solitude without appearing sad?",relationship_advice
t3_dlsbxj,How do I (22F) deal with working with a family member?,"I got a job with my mom‚Äôs (52F) company. I also live with my parents and sibling. We are in completely different departments. No overlap in any way. Different floors, different wings of a large building with hundreds of employees, part of a large international company with thousands of employees. There is no reason for us to ever cross paths professionally. 

How can I deal with the following:

1. Mom introduces me as her daughter to her team (a team is 4-6 people on one project) and close coworkers. But it still makes me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt mind that people know of our relationship, but I mind that people only recognize me as Mom‚Äôs daughter. I like to say that we are ‚Äúrelated,‚Äù but not HOW. 

2. She stalked me on our IM today. I was in an exceptionally long meeting and thus my status was listed as ‚Äúaway.‚Äù She called and texted me until I picked up hours later. She claimed to be worried that she didn‚Äôt know where I was. I can‚Äôt not share my status because coworkers need to know. I can‚Äôt block her. 

3. She constantly IMs me to check on my progress. I don‚Äôt owe her progress reports of any kind. Why can‚Äôt we catch up during lunch or when I get home?

4. She gives me unsolicited, useless advice. I can‚Äôt stand that my IM goes off constantly for things that don‚Äôt matter to me. It distracts me. I want to know if someone legit needs me, so I have to keep notifications on. 

5. She is really excited to share that I am working at her company. I want to share my employment status on my own time, but she already shared a Facebook status congratulating me and my super close friend for getting jobs at the same time. My friend was also peeved because she didn‚Äôt tell everyone yet. I told her to take it down. She said she won‚Äôt because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù I mainly don‚Äôt want my friends and family to think that I got this job because of her. I got this job because I‚Äôm smart and qualified. My mom isn‚Äôt important enough to get someone hired in a different department. 

6. I don‚Äôt want to bring my work home with me. I like talking about what a crappy day I had and how I don‚Äôt like a certain coworker, but frustrations about a program or technical things I have to do or work responsibilities are not something I want to talk about. She keeps trying to train me on a system outside of my 40 hrs/week. 

I get that she is excited for me. But how do I force her to stay within my boundaries?? I‚Äôm not going to my first day of kindergarten. I don‚Äôt need someone to hold my hand, and I surely don‚Äôt want her to. I want to stand out on my own as a capable employee and I‚Äôm afraid that her actions will hurt that. 

She‚Äôs historically illogical and entitled (so many story‚Äôs for r/entitledparents and r/raisedbynarcissists). Hate to admit it, but at times she has been emotionally/physically/financially abusive. Loves gaslighting. She is the matriarch of the family - she has final say in everything.

t3_dlsbsz,Am i really this retarted?,"Well, this whole ordeal could be a novel but ima try n sum it up.  Im in love with my ex gf and cant seem to cut it off as it really needs to be done.  Couple reasons that to me have made sense but once again i havent been interprettting anything correctly for over 3 weeks now.  So...

My ex gf and I of 5 years have had many many problems and hurdles thrown at us.  Always testing out relationship and strenghts and weaknesses.  Sometimes we would split up for a lil sometimes not.  I would always be the one to leave if it happened. Yet, once cooled down given a day or couple months we would always end up back together. ALWAYS.  So hard to fit everything in such short writing here but ya...  This time we been apart 5 mos.  Quite awhile, not our longest but quite awhile. Biggest difference frim the get was she actually threw me out this time.  Now listen, im not the easiest person to get along with but im also not the most difficult.  My loyalty to her in the last 5 years since we even met has never wavered.  I couldnt and wouldnt dare do something to make these temporary fights have a everlasting damage. Unfortunately it wasnt the same felt for her this time.   I found out shes been fkn some dude and more than once assuming more.  The same day i went ans visited her she reitterated she was my gf and loves me was same day i found this all out.  Since then life for me has been shit.  Although we werent living together i had always assumed, and i guess thats my fault, that the damage caused by cheating would be unrepairable.  Sooo... Dang theres just so much to all this but im trying to hit key points for the quick easy read and ultimately some direction.  As if its not obvious right?   Ive swallowed my pride and said i still love you and want us to make it work. The many times i left conversation open in hopes of hearing regret at her decision or to apologize has never come still to today.  And honesrly thats the biggest issue im having.  I mean im seriously willing to forgive and she hasnt even thought of apologizing.  Soooo wtf does that mean?  Obvious right, well not really.  She still till even today says she wants me back if i can do x y z.  And of course saying she loves me all the while..  What a mess.  Pure mess.  I know what to do i was just hoping maybe putting it in type would give some clarity i havent seen yet.  Kinda just enforced everything i was thinking actually.  I know if i was reading this id be like what a fkn chump. Lol.  Crazy truth is im not. Not by far..  Boils down to Love mixed with pain blurs alot. ALoT.  Comment if you choose.. Mind you im guilty of doing things wrong but nothing deserving of whata happened.  Crazy as this sounds it almost seems to be that she is able to belittle cheating to the point in her head that justifies it or makes it ok.  Dumfounded i am.  So i guess i do have a question after all.  How can she justify her behavior as acceptable in her head?  Like i mean she can straight face talk like it isnt nothing wrong she did because this that and the other...   Life is fkn grand isnt it.",relationship_advice
t3_dlsbce,I (26M) had one of the best sex with my ex (29F) after 3 months post break up and 1 month NC,"Now what? 

We hang out, ended up being romantic, and we hooked up! It was probably the best sex I‚Äôve experienced so far. I was confident, she was super sexy, we had a wonderful time together! 

I came over the next day and we cuddled, without talking, just caressing each other and listening to the sound of the beautiful evening. As I was leaving, she stopped me and told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to leave‚Äù so I cuddled with her more!

After about 30 mins, I left and when I got home, I received a text from her ‚ÄúAre you home?‚Äù I did not reply, so she called me. After the phone conversation, I fell asleep, I woke up on a text from her compliment me and my outfit.

We haven‚Äôt texted a lot today and I was thinking of her but only texted her once this morning and she replied. 

Now, I am scared to open up about where we at. Part of me just wants to enjoy this moment.

t3_dlj9cr,Tech kid [16M] groped me [16F] and I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"I‚Äôm a girl who puts a lot of time and passion into her theatre department at school. As such, I occasionally pick up roles and enjoy them fully. Recently, our school decided to do a big musical. I auditioned for the part of a certain cutesy animal lead, and I managed to get it. I was very excited. Keep in mind, our school has limited funds and limited microphones as well.

Now, it‚Äôs been a few weeks into rehearsals. Our first show is next week, and my costume finally came in. It‚Äôs rather childish, but a lot of people get a laugh out of me dancing around like a bunny in the costume.

One night during rehearsals, I‚Äôm standing backstage waiting for my chance to do a mic change with one girl on stage. The scene ends, the girl walks off, and she gives me her microphone. From there, I begin to put it on. I have a little trouble though, and one tech kid backstage notices this. Let‚Äôs call him Sam. Sam is a known furry in our theatre community, so I‚Äôm a little hesitant around him. He takes my microphone, and begins to put it on me, before grabbing my butt really tight as he slid the microphone‚Äôs box into my pants. I wanted to scream, but I thought it was an accident, so I remain quiet. From there, he turns me around and begins hiding my microphone‚Äôs wire under my shirt before grabbing my butt again, even tighter this time. It was painful.

Over the past 3 years I have had 2 failed serious relationships, and have lost contact with friends/family, all of which have stated that they felt like they ‚Äúneeded a break from me as my negativity is bringing them down‚Äù.

t3_dls6ns,How do I (20F) repair a relationship with my ex-best friend (20M) after his girlfriend (18F) sabotaged it?,"I'm 20F, ex-best friend is 20M, who I'll call John. John and I met our freshman year of college and hit it off right away. We became really close friends with no underlying romantic interests, as I've been out as a lesbian since I was 17. We hit it off so well that we decided to be roommates our sophomore year.

The first few months of our roommate relationship were great, and we very compatible lifestyle-wise. We never had any arguments about having guests over, drinking/smoking, cleanliness, or scheduling. If we had any issues we addressed them respectfully and at the time they arose.

Then John started seeing ""Melody"" (18F). I liked her at first, but their relationship quickly became intense. She said that she loved him within a month. As a freshman, she had no friends, and did not make any outside of John--he became her entire life. As a result, I was starting to feel abandoned by my friend. I thought a good way to remedy this was to become friends with Melody.

I started to learn some questionable things about their relationship through trying to get to know her. First, I could not hold a conversation with her. She would only talk about herself and would interrupt me in the middle of my sentences. She only talked about John, and told me that she had his entire schedule on Google Calendar and his whereabouts tracked on Find My Friends. She found this romantic and organized. She also told me that she would melt down if she didn't hear from him in twenty minutes or more. Finally, she told me GRAPHIC details of their sex life.

I asked around to others who knew Melody what she was like, as this raised alarm bells for me having been in abusive relationships before. They told me that she'd tried to date seven people in the month before she met John in her time at college, and he just happened to stick. She was an emotionally manipulative friend to a girl I'll call Kay, who also told me more about Melody. Apparently, Melody showed Kay some explicit pictures she'd taken of John. Other times, she would wake Kay up at 3am and knock on her door if she needed something. To say the least, she was an emotional leech, so Kay cut her off.

I tried to address some of my concerns with John coming from a place of compassion, explaining that some of Melody's behavior was worrisome. He told me it was none of my business and he could handle it himself, so I backed off. And then things with Melody went to shit. Either John or another friend must have told her what I'd said, so she told John not to spend time with me anymore and she spread rumors around the school about me. Fortunately her reputation and my better one among our classmates stopped them pretty quickly and people came to me to confirm that they were untrue. I was enraged and tried to address it with John, who called me childish and then played Dr. Phil and tried to get me to talk it out with Melody, who wanted to clear out the bad blood and resolve the situation. I told her I'd be civil, but I would not be friends.

My friendship with John was effectively over after that. We remained roommates but every time we hung out, he would spend all of his time on his phone texting Melody, who would conveniently have a ""crisis"" whenever he wanted to spend time with me. I gave up on him and put my energy into hanging out with other friends.

On the last day of the school year, I asked John if I could throw a small goodbye party in our room from 8pm-12pm. I was going to make some cocktails for my friends, and he was welcome to come if he wanted. He wanted the room to fuck Melody one last time before break, so we amended it from 8-11pm, and we agreed that this was a solid compromise. At 11:02, my friends had not yet left, so he busted down the door and started being a dick to everyone. I yelled at him that how dare he make my friends uncomfortable and feel unwelcome, and he needed to handle the situation more politely. I admit that it was wrong of me to raise my voice and get angry, but it was a culmination of frustration I should have dealt with earlier.

We talked the next day and John was minimally apologetic. I told him I needed space. I was going away the next semester on study abroad so we could talk when I got back. I went to New Zealand, am still here now, and started dating an amazing woman and made some great friends here. John reached out and sent me a very sweet and sincere apology for his behavior over Instagram two months ago, and he says he's thinking of ways to be a better friend to me when I get back. I want to be friends with him again so badly, but he's still dating Melody.

When I go home, is it worth it to be friends with him again? How do we even begin to repair our relationship?

TL;DR best friend's girlfriend sabotaged our relationship and we stopped talking, now he wants to be friends again but he's still dating her.

He seems to be getting progressively more selfish and inconsiderate every month. A good example of this is from last Sunday:

I work a full-time job with overtime almost daily as well as a part-time job. Right now I'm clearing 80 hours+ a week. 

We watched some movies and when 7pm (I wake up at 4AM for work) rolled around I could barely keep my eyes open. I told him that I wanted to sleep and he flipped out yelling about me only ever working or sleeping anymore. It's important to note that I'm working so much because our dog is having some serious medical issues that cost me 150 a week and i am the only one paying for OUR dog. 

I reminded him that when he was working a bunch, he would go to bed around 6 or 7 and I never complained. We have two other rooms that he can go watch movies in just like I've done. He then yells at me to go in one of the other rooms to sleep while he lays in my bed to watch movies since it's his house  (I pay 1/2 the rent).  This is after working both jobs that day, doing laundry, cleaning up a bit of his mess and cooking dinner. 

I don't ever know if it's possible to talk to him anymore or if it's even worth it. This man has never had a relationship last longer than a year besides his current one with me and I'm starting to understand why. I'm so exhausted from work and just life in general that I'm not sure trying to work things out is even worth the effort.

t3_dls3dx,"I (an 18F), got told by two men to ""smile"" and it's making me uncomfortable","TLDR;

I'm an 18F and have recently started working in my local supermarket. Being an introvert with a resting bitch face, I can tend to look kinda sad when in reality I'm actually happy or just daydreaming. I also look like I'm about 15, so I'm thinking maybe people tend to take advantage of that. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a serious person. I love having fun. I do smile, I'm quite goofy and I like to laugh (sometimes at pretty dumb things that no one else finds funny).

A few days ago, a colleague of mine (who I know pretty well, and is a genuinely kind guy) told me to ""Smile!"". Loudly. Impulsively, I flashed a fake smile, but deep down I felt humiliated and surprised since, a few minutes before he said that, I was genuinely smiling. But now, the smile felt fake and I felt as if I was performing rather than expressing emotion.

Just recently, it happened again. A stranger happened to be at the self-service checkouts where I was keeping watch and told me before he left - ""Hi. Would you like some advice? Smile more!"" And so I forced a smile, mumbled something and then he quickly left. To be honest, being told to smile more made me detest the thought of doing it because I don't like expressing fake emotions, just for the sake of doing it. 

Maybe they just have good intentions. Maybe they think I'm sad and want to cheer me up? Though I'd much prefer if they went up to me and asked if I was okay instead of demanding me to look a certain way. That would probably result in a natural smile.

It's just that I feel objectified and I'm wondering if you guys have ever experienced anything like this? I hope I'm not being overdramatic or sensitive, but I just needed to get this off my chest.

t3_dls2td,Want to end relationship but can‚Äôt financially?,"Hi everyone, 

Me and my partner have been together now for 5 Years I‚Äôm a 23M and she‚Äôs 23F. We met at university, we both decided to take breaks from our studies and move to another country. 

Now our relationship is toxic, we‚Äôre both not in love with eachother as we once were. Communication issues, trust issues, every issue you name it. 

So, I‚Äôd like us to break up (I think it‚Äôs mutual) but we‚Äôre both in bad financial situation. I know the obvious answer of ending the relationship no matter what if we‚Äôre not in love but hear me out and then let me know what you‚Äôs think. 

We both work at the same job. We‚Äôve leased a house which still has 7 months on the lease and to leave before costs $3000. We both have virtually no savings. We both have a personal loan of about $2k (or 6 month term) remaining. 

Now If I could stay in my job, find a flat and just keep living, fine by me. But I‚Äôd most likely have to leave the job because her 3 siblings work here as well (in warehouse operations btw) so realistically I think I would have to leave it‚Äôd be too awkward.

t3_dllmp9,S/O wants to move...but I'm not sure. Really need advice.,"First time post. Not even a lurker. Just need advice pretty badly right now and hopefully I came to the right place. Here's the situation:

Met girlfriend in college, freshly engaged (after 6+ years of dating). She goes to grad school where I live, grew up, and work--NJ. When she graduates/our lease ends in a year and a half, she wants to move somewhere else. Here are her reasons:

\-I have a lot of family and friends in the area, and we're currently about 20 minutes from my hometown. She feels like she wants to get a fresh start with me, since she feels like she's just ""fitting into my life"" here. 

\-She doesn't like NJ. There are no real good reasons here IMO, mostly just excuses I think that support the first point.

\-Her family is kind if strewn all over (SC, Chicago, CT), so she has no real ties to anywhere.

\-She feels we are young (26/27) and now is the time to explore and set roots somewhere on our own terms.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it's extra tough for me. My family really wants me to stay close. My family has always been loyal and incredibly supportive my whole life. My Dad has expressed that he wouldn't support me moving away because he feels like there's no valid reason to do so. They've really been perfect, and have given me as much or as little space as I've needed in my transition to adulthood, and have really embraced my fiance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I feel:

\-I don't love the idea of leaving just for a ""fresh start"" when I have a good job, friends, and family here. It's like leaving a situation where I'm completely comfortable and happy for somewhere that hopefully I can do the same thing. 

\-I like being close to my family, it makes me feel supported. Do I need to venture off a little bit to let my relationship grow independently of my parent's involvement? Maybe. But at what cost?

\-I have friends who are rooted here with family businesses, etc. Friends I've had my whole life. Am I someone who just can't leave their hometown area? Right now I'm not IN my hometown, but I can see where my fiance is coming from with just being *Hawaiian Brunch's Fiance* all the time and not establishing her own identity.

\-I have a successful career here, and I'd have to find a job elsewhere with as much potential, which isn't easy. My fiance has said that obviously we wouldn't sacrifice that if we couldn't find something promising for me elsewhere, which makes sense. But I still would be giving up what I have, which is unfortunate.

\-If/when we have kids, I'd really like to be close to my family because I feel like it's important and beneficial. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, leaving this area would help us establish ourselves, but would come at a much higher cost for me than my fiance. My family would feel like I'm leaving them for not a good reason, and I fear would resent my fiance and maybe even me for leaving. Super stressed out about this. Any advice would be so great.",relationship_advice
t3_dlozdt,"Scared of either breaking up or staying, leaving me (20F) and boyfriend (25M) in uncertainty for 2 months","Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years. I was 16 and struggled a lot with depression, an unstable home and a lack of friends before I met him. Just starting to pick everything up again, and there he was: a very stable guy. We have this very peaceful relationship with a lot of love, but I agreed to some of his flaws at 16 which i am struggling with at 20. For example, he is not very outgoing or affectionate and I struggle with him in company of friends. Thats just who he is, and I don‚Äôt desire to change him to my likings, as that feels unfair and i don‚Äôt want him to feel as if he‚Äôs ‚Äònot good enough‚Äô.  

Also, when I was a younger I imagined my life when I was 20 and studying way different than it is, as we live together in a house he bought for the two of us. I really longed for this stability, but now I have it, I‚Äôm not so sure I want it anymore. I thought I would be partying and sleeping around at this age. I wish life could just spice up a little bit, but he struggles with finding hobbies and filing his spare time. We tried to do that together, but it was never successful. He should find those things for himself, i cant do that for him.  But I do love him very much. I love taking care of him, I love cuddling with him, and all those things. But we can‚Äôt really talk for hours and we never could, and I‚Äôm starting to realize the importance in those ‚Äòlittle‚Äô things. 

That realization started two months ago, making me awfully sad. The thought of leaving everything behind and starting without him terrifies me. I‚Äôve talked to him about this, and he takes it so well. So well, that I‚Äôm worried he would lose himself in supporting me. He told me to take my time when I doubted him and damn, thats the strongest thing I‚Äôve ever seen anyone do. I admire him for only wanting the best thing for me and that is one of the things I love about him. I know that if I stay, our future together will be bright. He supports all my dreams and we are in a good place financially. Also, I‚Äôm not sure how ‚Äòperfect‚Äô somebody can be. Will there ever be someone who I match with better? I know you can never have it all, but am I giving too much, and taking too little? 
I have this huge fear of missing out on a life that I cant have because I have made this commitment to him. But I do love him, a lot. He is great and the feeling we share is very strong. 
Will someone ever love me so supportively as he does? 

Im scared to leave, because I will leave our happy, stable home for an unstable/uncertain future, and make him and myself terribly sad and lose someone who loves and supports me.
Im scared to stay, because I‚Äôm not sure he full fills my needs in the long run and I will miss out on weird, wild situations. 

Right now, Im sleeping at my dad‚Äôs house. Because I realized I cant think clearly about him when I am living with him. He supported that idea, but has given me an ultimatum: this Friday I have to make a decision. I understand that fully, but I‚Äôm now struggling a lot, emotionally. Im giving myself the time to think but also need advice.

This guy really seems perfect for me, I know I‚Äôd be happy if I dated him, but he‚Äôs not mine. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll never find anybody like him again. I still want to be his friend without things being awkward and painful between us. Please help me move on.",relationship_advice
t3_dls18g,Should I (17f) break up with my (17m) boyfriend?,"I (17f) am dating this guy (17m) who used to go to the same school as me. He previously had a crush on me and asked me out in class when we were in year 8, I was pressured from the other classmates and dated him for a day. But felt guilty and broke it off.

A couple years later, he slides into my dms and asks how I'm going since he dropped out at year 11. We get to talking for a month or so where he asks me out. After I got to know him, I started having feelings and said yes. We've met up a couple times, once at a park, then two or three times at his house to hang and watch a movie or two. We have cuddled and kissed only a couple  times. I'm not a very vocal person when it comes to affection, I can't say ""I love you"" to someone even if I do love them. Like my parents for example.

He hasn't met my parents, but I've told my family that I'm dating him. The usual questions come about. He doesn't have a job due to a medical condition, doesn't have a car or learners or anything like that. We planned for him to come to my house (I live with my parents as does he) but he was a no show. He told me he had a doctors appointment and he didn't have any data so he couldn't text me. I say OK. We then plan a hang out at my place again for the week after. 

That day rolls around and we're texting about it. I was at school waiting to be picked up from my mother (I have my learners). We buy some groceries for dinner and last minute I ask her if my boyfriend can come over, she doesn't say anything but looks annoyed since at that time his mother was sick so he asked if I could pick and drop him off. My mother doesn't like her car as she's been meaning to fix the hood lining that is coming off and her TV show she likes to watch would be on soon. 

I admit I should have asked permission instead of springing it on her last minute. But he didn't end up coming because he was having an argument with his older sister about centrelink and him letting his mother and older sister do everything for him. His doctor appointments, his headspace appointments (he's depressed), not getting a job etc. His sister messages me to try to convince him to finish a claim for centrelink. She told me he could get a job but doesn't even try to look for one. 

I was stunned at that because he told me he couldn't drive or work because of his medical condition. I guess he thought saying the truth would make him look bad to me. I haven't talked to him about it. 

He became very upset, blocking his sister on social media (he can only message on there because his phone is broken) and I became the middle person of the argument saying stuff for his sister to him and back again. Apparently he said some stuff to his sister that was hurtful and he knew would hurt her. 

He didn't reply to my last text so I left it, he didn't respond or read my message until a couple days later. He apologised for not replying, he set up his claim and will be doing an appointment to prove he has the medical condition so he can claim for disability. 

We get to talking and we catch up in what's been happening. We ask when to catch up at my place again, I said maybe this weekend but that I would ask my parents first. I haven't asked them yet. 

At dinner, my dad asks what the deal is with my boyfriend saying ""he's coming over then he doesn't then he's coming over to not come over again."" I say I don't know. Then my mum and my dad say I should probably break up with him since he doesn't have a job or a car and that I should get with someone who does and who is reliable. (I don't have a job but am at school and am going to higher education after) 

So, now I'm not sure what to do. Should I ask my parents for my boyfriend to come over or not? Should I break up with him? I'm confused and feel stressed just thinking about it since I also am busy with assignments since I'm graduating in a few weeks and I need to plan for prom.",relationship_advice
t3_dls117,Changing toxic behaviour and trying to get back together in the future?,"I was in a relationship with a girl I loved. I had shitty attitudes and didn't understand her position quite well. I'm in a process of changing my behaviours, understanding my feelings better and how/if to express them. Some of these attitudes weren't really toxic but more like counter-productive to her well being, which I regret not understanding. Does it sound crazy to try to fix my shit and later on, if I still have feelings for her, to try and get back together?

We ended up in a no-contact state and she doesn't want to be with me or in a relationship with anyone as of now. I fucked up, not badly but still. I'm changing for myself and not just to win her back, but being that I still feel for her I'd like for both of us to try again if we ever encounter paths.
 Our story was short-lived but there's a lot of stuff I'm not saying here, so if you have any questions feel free to ask.",relationship_advice
t3_dlrzyo,Should I give up ?,"I have known this man for years , we have dated off and on over the years . I am almost always the one who texts or calls first . "" Hello"" or "" have a good night "" ECT. He would not respond or read it and not respond . Days would pass and he finally responds but it always with an excuse. I have no idea what to do because when we go out we have a grate time and we will talk for hours on the phone . We did have a deep conversation once and I confessed that I couldn't see myself sexual with him . He didn't even pry or try to find out why and I have wanted to talk about it with him but he is never available. I have confessed that I loved him and told him that it's ok if he doesn't address it . I don't know where I went wrong or if he only wanted to have sex . I hate to think that but it feels like he is playing with me and I don't know if I should just move on . in truth he is the only man who has ever show me that he finds me attractive..... besides sex and I will admit I am scared that I messed up something that could have been good.",relationship_advice
