    "Reddit is a collection of online discussion boards known as \"subreddits\", which cover a variety of topics. In this project we will be looking into the subreddits, dating_advice and relationship_advice. The choice of these two subreddits is motivated by their text-heavy posts. We will be creating and comparing two models: a logistic regression and a multinomial naive Bayes classifier. Our results may be useful for any reddit user who is unsure which subreddit is the most appropriate to submit his new post, so that he can attract the most comments."

      "Asking out your first crush year after school when both are adult Good idea Anyone tried it Should I We re both now Way back in school we won the poetry prize together with both our entry impressing whomever picked the winner and we both wound up being appointed vice house captain of our house in th year where we gave some speech at assembly together I crushed hard on this girl in school I thought she wa the most beautiful girl I ve ever seen and very few woman have ever compared in my eye but I lacked the confidence to do anything but be embarrassed and secretive about how I felt even though I made it abundantly clear with how much I stared at her in English class turning around looking right back at her wa hardly subtle with the frequency I would do it and how I would be totally feckless when I wa alone with her Biggest regret of my life wa failing to be bold in those moment But at the time I wa not outgoing or confident and I knew all three of her ex over the year many were my friend and I didn t want to make thing weird admitting my feeling were the same a them a while they dated her I distanced myself from them all during those time Couldn t stand to be around them like that I walked home once with her and one of my friend while they dated It wa incredibly awkward and even I knew at the time they weren t happy together it wa incredibly uncomfortable The only friend I confided in at the time told me they were unhappy together all throughout the time they dated cry and arguing with one another and when they broke up they became much happier people I won t deny this made me very happy my friend encouraged me to make a move after that breakup happened but I wa shit scared to do anything and did nothing What I want to know is how should I go about trying to reconnect with her and ask her for a date if she wa open to such an idea NOt only do I want to shoot my shot but I also want to stop being tired and hung up on memory of the past wishing I d acted when I hadn t We re both now single she seems to be in a good place and open to dating someone new but I don t really know her too well any more Haven t spoken in year Is it really a simple a asking her if she want to meet up for coffee or a drink sometime out of the blue via facebook or something or should I try running into her in person and arranging meeting up from there again Or is this a bad idea at heart and I should just try burying this hatchet and accept I fucked it way back then in school because I feel like there is still hope for me yet here And yet I am so fucking afraid of doing anything this is the original crush we ve all experienced the scary one I ve never acted on and I have a chance here to actually learn or gain something from the opportunity whatever the outcome I need some advice here My parent and sibling would want detail to get advice and I ve never asked them for advice on this stuff anyway I ve never gotten the sense they understand this subject or me well anyway and I m not sure how helpful their advice would be Couple of friend have said just to act on it anyway and see what happens but I need further opinion But I also feel I have to make a move and do something or I ll regret never acting on my feeling even once with this girl because it s followed me for year even though we ve spent many apart I still kept tab couldn t help it I m more than aware she could say no and I think I d feel much lighter and free to move on with that answer a many others I ve seen in this sub have done the same More than aware she could say yes and I d be the happiest man on the planet for that moment More than aware she could say yes we date and I realise this infatuation wa a bit fantastical and we don t click or match well together a a couple Again this is possible but probably a good thing for moving forward and developing a a person Or it could be the best decision I ve ever made in my life if she doe say yes and we click I just don t know And that s shit scary Is it worth putting it on the line to find out I asked out a coworker a short while ago after asking advice here and she said yes I felt so empowered and unafraid afterwards wondering why I felt so scared in the first place Things didn t work out But this girl feel different I m afraid she will say no I m afraid she will say yes and I wa wrong What do I do \n",

      "Coming off too hot what s next Background four year ago I wa at a party with a friend of mine with some of his girl friend It wa really cozy and great fun and I wa fortunate enough to get a chance to talk to this really cool smart and witty girl We spent the rest of the night just talking the two of u ignoring the ongoing party Now the day is over and we part way and nothing could come of it really a she wa in a relationship and I wa moving to Germany for school That s fine and I thought it wa a perfect example of a fellow person you just click with Never talked to her again Fast forward four year and I saw her updating her Facebook picture so I asked my friend out of curiosity if he knew whether she wa single or not to which he said yes she wa single Now I didn t really think too much about it but the very next day I bump into her on the bus She didn t recognize me and I wasn t too sure if it wa her or not a the bus wa quite crowded I didn t say hi but I passed her a message on Face and asked if she wa on that very same bus Few hour later she confirmed and wa surprised to hear from me We instantly hit it off just a we did four year ago and we started casually talking Things were going great from what I could tell with both being flirtatious sending each other video of her life at uni picture of her self joke meme deeper question etc pretty well rounded Now over the last two month I ve been on a high at time a engaging with her is great fun and it s a great addition to my life I m looking forward to hearing from her and flirt with her I m well aware of her busy schedule with school outside of where we hail from trying to get friend in a different country surviving basically And I do know she rarely us her phone or social medias a she blatantly told me and excused herself for not replying instantly at time My friend confirms this a he a great friend of hers and he know we ve been engaging with each other That s fine My problem is this I believe I ve came off too fast and smothered her a bit a I feel the conversation is usually always me initating and more abrupt and short I m in this peculiar situation that I give everything for stuff that interest me her included which I know is a bad thing She hasn t said I ve smothered her outright and contrary she s confirmed I should just continue doing the same She did however confirm that the whole situation is rather hard for her at time given the circumstance she talk more with me than any of her friend e g After thinking more and fearing that I m back to my old self of cramming her with text I ve tried to slow down a bit and let her enjoy uni life But at the same time the response are more platonic and sporadic now I feel almost like it dying down It take a whole while longer to hear from her and she doesn t really initiate her self However she always challenge and asks indepth once we do talk and it s always a longer texting session It s therefor a mixed bag which confuses me She will be back in roughly month so my idea wa to don t pester her every single day but check up on her once in a while in an effort to build that attraction better so by the time she s back should be easier for her to accept a date Question is how should I proceed and how do I find back to the groove I feel I should have the answer myself but I m keen on other perspective on whether I came off too strong is true and what I could do about it now that I presumably have damaged the courting period a bit Ideas \n",

      "We never defined the relationship I still have feeling for him but I m afraid he s moved on I M have been hanging out with this guy let s call him Randy M for about one year We met on an app and chatted for about week before I finally met him in person Due to the distance between u about an hour drive we only saw each other a few time during the first two month However I could tell there wa a connection between u We continued hanging out when we could and we eventually started seeing each other more often During the spring and early summer thing were going really well and I kind of assumed we were seeing each other even though we never had that conversation I really wanted to define the relationship and have that talk but I wa afraid I would scare him off I wa happy with the way thing were I knew that labeling our relationship wouldn t really change much in term of how often we see each other and talk and I wa pretty confident he wasn t trying to see other people neither wa I Also I wa naively assuming he would initiate the talk because he s older and more experienced For all of these reason I put off having the talk A few month ago I noticed little thing begin to change He became a little le affectionate we wouldn t hang out a much and when we would go out for dinner or drink the conversation did not flow a easily a before One night after dropping me off at home he texted me and asked if we had a status I instantly became tense and anxious because I wa expecting the worst and because this seemingly came out of nowhere I told him we haven t talked about it but I would love to have that conversation He texted me back and said he thought we were in the friend category I immediately asked if we could talk instead of text so I called him We ended up having an emotional conversation about a lot of stuff going on in his life at the moment friend family his job and we didn t really talk about our status During the next few week after that conversation thing were relatively normal We still texted and hung out the same amount a before and the topic didn t come up I wanted to bring it up and continue the conversation but there wasn t a good time in my opinion So I put it off To back track a little a few month after we started hanging out Randy went to Europe for vacation He ended up meeting a guy there on one of the first day let s call him Anthony and apparently they instantly hit it off Anthony hung out with Randy and his friend on a few of his excursion and when it wa time to leave they decided to keep in touch During the time when thing were going really well with me and Randy I would occasionally see text pop up from Anthony but I figured he wa an old friend or something I never knew how they met Fast forward to my emotional conversation with Randy one of the thing he mentioned wa that his friend Anthony wa coming to visit soon and that he really liked him When I heard that I had a mini panic attack Why did he just tell me he liked someone I thought he liked me We didn t spend much time on that topic but I remembered he said it and that stuck with me for the next few week Fast forward to last month Anthony come to visit Leading up to his visit a I mentioned before thing were relatively normal between me and Randy I wanted to have the talk but I didn t see a good opportunity to have it When Anthony arrived I gave Randy his space to enjoy the visit I didn t text him at all during the week long visit and he never texted me However Randy posted most of the visit on social medium so I got to see exactly what they were doing Every new post and picture that I saw of the two of them broke my heart a little bit more During the year or so that Randy and I were together he never posted about u on social medium and he didn t have many picture of u together saved on his phone Now Anthony come to visit and he post selfies and picture of every place they go I wa extremely jealous and pretty miserable the whole week When Anthony finally left Randy texted me and we began to communicate a normal I knew that I needed to talk to him about how I felt so I went over to his house one night to watch a movie Before the movie we decided to order food so he opened an app on his phone put in his order and then handed me the phone to place my order He left the room to use the bathroom and I had a very strong urge to snoop through his picture to see what I could find so I did The reason I did so wa because I guess I wanted to confirm what I already thought but didn t want to admit that Randy see u a friend and nothing more Well I guess I got what I asked for There were picture video of them doing thing they didn t post about selfies of them kissing and even some x rated video My heart literally sank into my stomach and I started to have a panic attack Randy came back and saw that I wasn t myself and that s when I finally told him we need to talk I asked him what he thought about u and the past year He said that there were time when he wanted to take our relationship to the next level and he wa looking for sign from me that indicated I wanted to do the same I absolutely wanted to take thing to the next level but a I said above I wa afraid I would scare him off and I didn t want to mess up what we had going Therefore he interpreted my action a not wanting to take the next step and just stay where we were So I guess he assumed I wanted to stay more a friend which is not at all what I wanted However since neither of u said anything to one another over the next few month we both kept assuming what the relationship wa I assumed we were exclusive but not exactly boyfriend and he assumed we were nothing more than friend or FWB Now there is someone else in the picture that Randy clearly ha feeling for I tried to ask Randy about him and Anthony and what he considered them to be and he said that he is unsure He s unsure whether to pursue a relationship or just let it go because of the distance I left the conversation in an OK headspace but when I got home I completely broke down I ve been an anxious miserable wreck for the past week thinking about how I missed my chance with Randy How we both had feeling for each other and all it took wa for one of u to say something Or would that have even mattered because he had been texting Anthony the whole time we were together I feel extremely guilty for snooping through Randy s phone and I can t get the picture video out of my head Does Randy still have feeling for me He did at one point and we ve remained friend this whole time Is he going to move to Europe to try and make it work with Anthony Or are they not going to try and make it work I asked Randy if we can continue our conversation this weekend and he agreed I guess I m looking for advice about the situation in general and potential question I can ask Randy So far this is what I have I still really like you and have feeling for you Do you still have feeling for me Or is the door shut on u and you re trying to make the relationship with Anthony work I feel very guilty about snooping through his phone and I m wondering if I should confess Should I ask about Anthony Or will the detail of their relationship just make me feel worse TL DR I ve been hanging out with a guy for one year We never defined the relationship I thought we were more than friend he thought we were just friend Now he ha feeling for someone else but I still have feeling for him What should I do \n",

      "M being lead on F So just to preface this this is a girl I met online We live about mile apart But anyways I met this girl on this beta for a game And we got to talking I added her to my friend group because she seemed cool We started playing other game together and really enjoying each other company Around February we started to flirt back and forth This progressed into sexting and at the time that s all it wa It wa just messing around And then a few month into this we start talking more romantically instead of sexually We flirted and talked about being together but she said she wasn t ready Because she had gotten out of a yr relationship I understood and I wa there for her during her panic attack and down moment surrounding that and her family problem Anyways we start talking more and more romantically even to the point of her and I saying I love you and such thing I ask her out one day and she say it s not the time I said okay But over the next month after it devolved into basically she never loved me like that that she tried to love me like that but couldn t We stopped talking because I just wa so hurt probably more than I have ever been in my entire life She say she want to be single to pursue her life ambition of making her family proud of her And cut to today technically last night I see a post on her Facebook and Instagram of her and a guy The caption wa spent the weekend with a great man I messaged her saying that I ve had enough and I couldn t forgive her for all of this because she wanted me to forget that she hurt me and to try and be just friend not romantic side no sexual side nothing Just friend And I told her I m done and she say she s been done for a while I unfriended her on every platform I could But seeing her with that guy is burned into my mind and I m broken rn So my question is how do I move on How do I get the image of them out of my head \n",

      "I [ M] think I am still in love with a girl [ F] I dated for month who moved back to Germany Need advice Apologies for the length of this post I just really need to get this off my chest Thanks in advance to anyone willing to hear me out I have always struggled with social anxiety and have never had a meaningful long term relationship in my life So earlier this year I did what most single guy who don t go out much do and made a Tinder account I met a girl on there and we really hit it off over text so we set up a date at a local bar She wa absolutely stunning Smart beautiful funny interesting and everything else you could ever dream for in a girl We talked and drank until midnight and we were too tired to continue We didn t wait long to see each other again and again we talked and drank all night We kissed and from that point she had stolen my heart I think it wa the first time I have ever truly been in love However there is a catch She is German She wa only here to complete an internship that wa necessary for her to apply to PhD program here in the States she already ha a master s degree at the age of That s how smart and amazing she is She left for Germany month later with the status of if she would ever come back to my area of the States up in the air We agreed to stay in touch but we didn t really address the status of our relationship we never really explicitly said that we were dating I think because we both knew it would have to end soon Messages got more and more far apart and now it s been month since we ve spoken I don t know about her but the reason I stopped messaging her regularly is for two reason I wanted to move on The distance just seems too far for u to work out Even if she return to the state to complete her PhD it s unlikely to be anywhere near me I don t know if I wa a special to her a she wa to me Frankly I highly doubt it While I have never been in a long term relationship she had been in one that lasted year Yes That s not a typo The guy had purposed to her and she rejected it because she felt she wa too young and had no idea where her life would take her which led to them breaking up A month fling with some American boy must be totally forgettable by her standard right Every date I ve been on since then just hasn t been the same Nobody is a smart a beautiful or a funny a her I can t get her out of my head It s like I am not even looking for another girl I m just looking for the next her However because I have never been in love before I am really concerned that I m just working myself up and making what we had out to be more than it wa since I have nothing to compare it to Maybe what we had wa mediocre at best but I just have nothing to compare it to I don t know what to do It s unlikely she feel the same way about me and even if she did we are practically on opposite side of the planet should I just forget about her We haven t spoken in month would it be too weird to suddenly tell her how I feel I didn t even do that properly while she wa here Any advice at all would be appreciated I just feel lost \n",

      "Would you say that ending a relationship the second time is easier So basically I f ended my relationship once and we m got back together I am just curious if it is easier to end it the second time I feel like in some way maybe it is because your partner went through it once and realizes it must just not be working and can come to term with it more I am aware this issue probably is situational but I personally think it can be easier just because the person ending it ha more confidence that it is over since they gave it another shot there is le guilt that you could be ending it for the wrong reason I also believe that it isn t just a bomb that is being dropped on you both and that it can be understood a bit more \n",
